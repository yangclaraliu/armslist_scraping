It also causes the cylinder pin access through the under barrel lug to become redundant as the cylinder is easily removed after separating the two major units. Very similar to a percussion Colt but the British design adds a top-strap for much more rigidity. Relatively few wedge frame guns were made however, due to the transition to cartridge revolvers and screw into frame barrels. This example wedge frame is of the earliest designs evident by deep 3 groove rifling. It has fine floral and single line engraving including large numbers on the cylinder, for reference during heat of battle. Finish is blue turning splotchy brown, and patina on ""in the white"" rammer, trigger and hammer. It is in Fine condition, all original parts, smoothest double action and light trigger for single action. Grips very nice, undamaged, just a few bumps on one side and tiny fill at top on one side. No pitting inside or out (including bore). The original nipples look unfired. Lock-up tight, correct functioning of action perfect."

I did not put the kit on and have never taken it off, but I was told the SKS itself is a Norinco. Fires great, fun and cheap to shoot. I recently moved into an AK and will be working on an AR before long so I am selling some excess to buy parts. It's not a perfect rifle. I painted the exterior myself. The safety is kind of wonky due to the kit. It tends to back out if you pull the trigger repeatedly while its on safe. I only have the one mag for it. The spring in the mag may need some looking at as it misfeeds on occasion. I have tried other SK mags from my friends weapons and have not had the issue. I am asking $650, but feel free to shoot me an offer."

It weighs nearly 1/3 less than it's ground cousin weighs. Virtually every part has been machined to reduce its weight. With a 300 mile per hour slip stream to cool it, the barrel can be thin and light. The military version is the Browning ANM2, the Colt commercial version is the MG40. It was used in both single and twin mounts, and as a fixed wing gun up until WW2 when it was realized that the .30 caliber round was simply too light to take out modern fighter aircraft. It was replaced but the .50 caliber M2. John Browning worked with the Belgian military and developed the FN series of guns, the FN30 ground gun and the FN38 & 39 aircraft guns. During WW2 the .30 caliber Browning was primarily used in training. This specific machine gun was purchased and repaired by our gunsmith's over the course of a year. This machine gun accepts 30-06 Springfield round, but if you remove a tiny plate it will accept the native round. Tested five days ago on the range, fully functioning.

THANKS!For your consideration today we have a beautiful Smith and Wesson Model 36 Chief's Special in .38 Special caliber, in the long-discontinued nickel finish. This gorgeous little revolver would make either a nice addition to your collection of classic S&W revolvers, or could be used even today as an excellent self-defense gun. This spotless gun is in great condition, and may never have actually been fired, or if it was, shot very little. The gun comes with its original box and papers. Even the factory wax paper that these guns used to be wrapped in is included. In addition to the original small grips, there is a set of Smith and Wesson factory combat stocks, known back in the day as ""Banana Grips"". It simply doesn't get much better or cleaner if you are a fan of classic Smith revolvers.I will entertain reasonable best offers, or trades (full or partial) on firearms of equivalent quality. The revolver may be seen at my office just outside of Homestead by appointment. Please do not ask me to meet you in a parking lot somewhere to show you the gun. For a number of good reasons, I do not do this. My office is easy to get to, and safe for both of us and is the only location where I show my firearms.
Due to the collectible nature of this revolver, I will consider shipping it to your FFL if you are not local, at a cost of $35.00, but only after I have spoken with you by phone, and confirmed directly with your FFL that you are for real and he is expecting the transfer. I reserve the right to refuse a sale if I am not comfortable that you are a legitimate buyer. Regardless of whether we are shipping thia gun, or doing a face to face transaction, all applicable laws will be complied with.Thanks for looking at my listing."

Measured at 22” (H) x 13"" top / 12"" bottom (W) x 8” top / 10” bottom (D), IBEX-30L is THE ultimate 30-liter multi-role backpack that “fillets-open” and gives you lightning-fast access to your gear. A continuous YKK #10 zipper opening with extra-large ITW zipperpulls offers you 270-degree top-to-bottom & front-to-back access to the foam-padded main compartment. Simple pull it open and you will have a full view of all gear laying right in front of you.
Delivered in a low profile package with an infinitely user-configurable main compartment, IBEX is both versatile and comfortable. Hook-and-loop panels line the inside of the foam-padded main compartment on all four walls allowing any configuration you may need.
Side compression straps adjust the width/thickness of the IBEX when needed, and prevent unintentional opening of the main compartment. Lockable YKK zippers provide additional security to your gear stored inside. Three built-in grab handles (one top, two sides) let you carry the IBEX in all three directions. 
Like all Vanquest® products, IBEX is made with ultra-durable 1000-D Cordura® nylon, treated with water-repellent DuPont® Teflon for easy cleaning. Its construction means the IBEX-30 is up to any task in the field, and will be ready each time you need it.
IBEX's ergonomic & shock-absorbing shoulder straps come with load-lifters. Padded back with breathable mesh, adjustable sternum strap with an emergency side-release whistle, and a padded removable & height-adjustable waist belt further ensure the IBEX fits perfectly on you and let you carry heavy loads with comfort. The front panel features a hook-and-loop field with a shock-cord web to secure more of your gear on the outside.
Dual side pockets with YKK #8 zippers are ideal for hydration and radio storage. Each side pocket has an internal window opening for routing hydration hose or wire into the main compartment then exit to the main hose/wire port on the top backside of the IBEX. One-inch paracord loops for equipment suspension inside the side pockets are provided. MOLLE/PALS panels are found on the outside of the side pockets for additional attachment and expansion.
The shoulder strap can be used to swing the IBEX-30 to your front, and give you instant access to both the side or main compartment like our world-renowned VSlinger™ slingpacks.*Photos courtesy of Vanquest Gear, Inc"

596,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6764596,"For Sale:  STEYR ARMS SCOUT 308WIN 19"" GREY","Renton, Washington, United States","$ 1,799","Listed On: Thursday, June 1, 2017",Rifles,Steyr                                                                                ,no type,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"The Steyr Scout provides the ideal solution for versatility, durability, accuracy and reliability in a compact and lightweight bolt-action rifle platform. Developed in a nearly decade-long collaboration with legendary Marine Corps Lt.Col. Jeff Cooper, the Scout boasts an extensive list of innovative features.
The lightweight bolt-action, all-purpose Steyr Scout rifle was designed to accept a low-powered, forward-mounted scope for accurate fire and both-eyes-open operation to detect flanking dangers. Backup “ghost-ring” iron sights integrated to the top rail can be deployed within seconds should the optics fail. The rifle can also be fitted with a standard scope, should the need arise.
In keeping with Cooper’s requirement for a magazine cutoff, Steyr incorporated a two-position magazine system that allowed the rifle to be fed individually with the five-round magazine in a lowered position. The magazine could be seated one step further with minimal pressure, allowing the bolt to feed cartridges directly from the magazine. A second five-round backup magazine is contained in the buttstock in case of an urgent need to reload.
With a fluted, cold-hammer-forged barrel measuring 19 inches, an overall length of 38.6 inches and an out-of-the-box weight of just 6.6 pounds, the Scout is a breeze to pack out on long adventures, patrolling the farm or taking a quick trip to the range. The compact design of the stock features an innovative integrated bipod that is hardly noticeable until it is folded out from the stock. Between the bipod legs is a UIT rail for attachments, and the stock is outfitted with five press-and-twist sling-swivel attachment points that allow the addition of Cooper’s favored Ching Sling on either side of the rifle.
The Steyr Scout is built on the Safe Bolt System (SBS) action with a unique 2+1 safety function that offers three settings operated by a wheel switch on the tang of the stock. The FIRE mode (safety off) is indicated by a red dot, and the first level of SAFE mode disables the firing mechanism while allowing the bolt to be cycled. The second SAFE position locks the bolt, at which point the bolt can be pushed down against the stock, locking the firing pin and firing mechanism out of firing position, allowing safe transportation with a round in the chamber. Simply pressing the safety’s release tab and rolling it forward returns the bolt to either the SAFE or the FIRE position.
The unique features make the Scout a self-contained platform that can easily be carried in a rifle scabbard without any need for attaching/detaching a bipod or finding extra pockets for a spare magazine, perfect for use on horseback, ATV or on a vehicle rifle rack."

It was made in Belgium by Fabrique Nationale (FN Herstal) for Browning Arms. It is one of roughly 10,000 made in that era and likely one of the few left surviving. I'd put it being made sometime in the 1920s. All my research into it states that it is an ""unmarked"" 16. Usually the 16 gauges were marked as ""sweet 16s"", but only from around 1949 on. This is a decently rare example as it pre-dates those, and still has the enhancements and engravings. For it's age, it is in great shape and hasn't been shot much over its life. Conservatively, I'd say that the overall finish is about 80%, if not more. Wood is in great shape as well. Factory Engraving is also easily visible. It is all original and a great addition to any collection."

Production ceased abruptly when 8 gauges were outlawed for hunting. This one has been shot very little and retains over 90% of the original case coloring. It locks up tight and the breech faces show very little firing wear. 31"" fancy damascus barrels that retain over 90% of the original damascus pattern. Excellent bores with no dents or pitting. Wood is also excellent with no cracks or repairs. Wood has the expected handling marks for a 130 year old gun. LOP is 14 3/8"" and drop is 1 3/4"" and 3"". Hard rubber buttplate has warped a little. Barrels have probably been shortened from 34"" to 31"". Gun comes in a Browning leather case with 12 empty Remington 8 gauge cases. A rare find. Johnstone emigrated from England to Pittsburgh and imported English guns in the white and finished them under his name. I have had other Westley Richards and Scott patent guns finished and retailed by him and all have been high quality as this one is. Gun has English proofs,"
