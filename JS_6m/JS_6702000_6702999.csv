Association of Chicago to correct conditions in that city that had been highlighted by the disastrous fire of 1871. Following initial successes, this association formed separate committees for the Fire Department, Police Department, sewers, water supply, architecture, etc. as an adjunct to the elected municipal government. In John Flinn.s 1887 .History of the Chicago Police., page 130, he describes the police loss in this 1871 fire, among other equipment, ..muskets to the number of 620, $8,680;.six brass cannon... On page 208, documenting conditions within the police department in 1877, he states: .There was in possession of the department this year a quantity of arms, purchased by the Citizens. Association, consisting of four twelve-pound and two six-pound guns . one ten barrel Gatling gun . 296 Springfield breech-loading rifles, and 60,000 rounds of ammunition. These arms, equipments and ammunition were held by the department with the understanding that they were to be returned to the association at the demand of the executive committee. The department had also at this time 102 Springfield rifles of its own, which had been purchased by citizens and presented to the police.. During the 1870.s, the Chicago police were formally known as the Chicago City Police, .C C P., note enclosed tintype of a Chicago police officer with the well known .C C P. belt buckle. In the December, 2001 issue of the Gun Report, noted authority Mike Carrick, Staff Editor, posed his own question concerning an 1866 Model Allin conversion, lock plate dated 1862, 2 band, 32 ½. barrel, 18 5/8. between bands, front sight 1 ¼. back from muzzle, hinge strap stamped .C A. and on the receiver in place of a later serial number .C C P.. The number .111. was stamped on the top of the comb forward of the butt plate. The slot for the middle band retaining spring was filled-in, professionally done so as to be barely visible.  In the February, 2011 catalog of a recognized, national firearms auction company, a similar Model 1866 Allin conversion with 2 bands and a 31 1/8. barrel was advertised with .C C P. stamped on the receiver but no .C A. on the hinge plate. This rifle was stamped with the number .76. on the top of the comb ahead of the butt plate. The photo that accompanied this auction item seems to indicate that the middle band was intact with the muzzle area not in the photo. I also have in my collection another Model 1866 Allin conversion, lock plate dated 1864 (the .4. is very shallow), barrel shortened to 31., with middle band intact and the front band removed (and altered stock professionally shortened). The receiver is stamped .C C P. in place of later serial numbers but no .C A. on the hinge plate. It has the number .7. stamped on the top of the comb forward of the butt plate. It also has what appears to be .W 101. stamped on the right side of the butt. It has been nickel plated, probably for later parade or honor guard use. This should explain .C C P. stampings on the receivers of approximately 400 Model 1866 shortened conversions as long as the stock numbers fall within the recorded inventory totals of 296 provided by the Citizens. Association (.C A.) and the 102 previously in the police. hands (no .C A.).Due to the large amount of Scams on armslist I will not answer ""Do you still have this"" emails or ""What is the lowest price on this item""  If you are interested then email me with your name location and contact info  and we will take it from there .

Chambered in .380ACP and featuring a fixed barrel blowback action, the P232 Two-Tone is one of the most reliable back-up pistols available with a well-earned reputation as a rugged, accurate shooter. Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth contours and rounded, snag-free edges make it ideal for personal protection. It’s the pistol’s small size that makes it easy to carry concealed whether in a discreet holster, purse or on the ankle and yet the outstanding ergonomics of the grip design allow for comfortable shooting even in large hands. At under 19oz in the Two-Tone version, the sleek single-stack P232 is a pleasure to carry throughout the day. No wonder it’s one of the premier off-duty guns carried by federal agents and law enforcement professionals today. The P232 Two-Tone features a natural finished stainless steel slide, black hard coat anodized alloy frame."

Brand new, in box, and ready for the range! Through an ingenious and simple arrangement we have solved the main disadvantage of Bullpup rifles; case ejection. Traditional side ejection is not ambidextrous and forward ejection, like in the Kel-Tec RFB, is quite complex. The RDB (Rifle Downward-eject Bullpup) features a rotary bolt with a spring loaded ejector and an extractor facing down. The spent case is pulled backwards along the top of the magazine and then ejected through a vertical chute. The hammer is U-shaped and runs outside the chute and above the magazine. The bolt travel is longer than traditional designs but well within the ergonomic constraints of a rifle. Other advantages are gravity assisted ejection, higher bolt energy at feeding and a slower fyull auto rate (when applicable). The RDB is built around a common steel skeleton formed by the receiver and barrel sub-assemblies."

504,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6702504,For Sale:  You must have NO LIFE..SERIOUSLY!,"Everywhere, Columbus, Ohio",FREE,"Listed On: Tuesday, April 11, 2017",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Dear who ever the hell you are, with no life what so ever, ptobably living in your mothers basement, inhaling a super large meat lovers pizza, get the hell over it man!! You are appealing to absolutely no one and making your self look like a cheap, poor bastard that has buyers/sellers envy as your always complaing about prices! Your prolly the same douche that sends offers and claim that no matter the condition of the firearm they are only worth 80% of the lowest listed price online! Get over yourself! There are some people who actually want a ""brand new condition"" or ""unfired"" firearm but are looking to save some cash so why would someone go pay retail, then sales tax, or if ordered online for ""the lowest price,"" then pay shipping and FFL in 90% of the online sales, when they could save the taxes and then some, save shipping costs and FFL transfer, and save the wait time for those who are to impatient to shop online and wait! Some people (the majority) would like to save upwards of $100 + on the same condition of firearm they can go buy in the store. That $100 + pays for a holster, sights, accessories, etc. Yes there are some that are excessive as in listed over store price in which case i agree, however if the majority offer a mint firearm with minimal rounds or no rounds fired then offering it on the used market for $100 + under store price is a good deal for the majority. As for your used car comparrison, thats not exactly true as in buy it, drive it off the lot, drive it back on and see what you get. 99% of the dealerships have a 72 hr policy so your example is completely wrong! And even if so, its all about the vehicle you buy as is for the firearm you buy. If you go buy a brand new Corvette Z06 ($95-$100,000), put 5k miles on it, resell it 6 months later, you will get $85-$90,000 (less than 10% depreciation on a driven car). You buy a Kia and it will be drmatically different. You go buy a Wilson Combat for $3400, fire 1000 rounds through it, you can resale it for $3100 (less than 10% depreciation fired) and your giving someone a premium firearm at $300 under retail in factory condition (providing you didnt beat the piss out of it). 100% of the people in the market for a brand new Corvette Z06 will take the $10,000 savings for one with 5k miles over buying one with 0 miles for retail! Same situation with firearms. If someone is in the market for a specific firearm they will take a 10% discount for one that looks and performs just as a brand new one! Just because you cant /wont pay the asking prices on armslist does not mean everyone else should follow your lead! Instead of sitting here wasting your time preaching your bs and wondering why your mom said she wished she would have swollowed, be productive, go complain about Veteran homelessness, go complain about youth homeleness, go preach about addolesent drug abuse, go complain about domestic violence, go complain about something other than fucking firearms! Someone asking $1000 for a firearm thats at Vance's for $1,199.99 is not harming nor effecting ANYONE...PERIOD! What is harming and effecting millions, homelessness, drung addiction, drug abuse, child abuse, domestic violence, etc.!! Make your voice heard where needed, you ranting about firearm postings......you truely are a load your momma should have swollowed!With that said, Hey guys, I have a brand new, unfired Glock 19 Gen 4 in Magpul Dark Earth posted up.

As a matter of fact, the XTR-12 is a short-stroke piston-driven gas-operated shotgun and comes with a rotating bolt head and six locking lugs; the XTR-12 bolt is indeed an AR-10 type bolt beefed up in size for the 12-gauge shotshells. Feeding through single-column detachable magazines holding two, five or seven 12-gauge shotshells with a 76mm/3"" (""Magnum"") case, the UTAS XTR-12 semi-automatic shotgun comes with a 18,5"" long 4140 stainless steel machined barrel adapted to use several types of chokes; the bolt is manufactured of the same 4140 stainless steel, while the structure is manufactured out of lightweight aluminum alloy and magnesium, in order to keep the weight under acceptable levels. The UTAS International XTR-12 semi-automatic shotgun comes with an M4-type ergonomic pistol grip and a five-positions collapsing polymer stock, and strips in two receivers just like an AR-15; its total lenght ranges between 96,5cm and more or less 1 metre, depending from the stock extension. The XTR-12 is 3,6 kilograms long and sports fully ambidextrous controls and several MIL-STD-1913 ""Picatinny"" rails for several types of aiming devices or tactical accessories. There's no word yet concerning availability or pricing.    Manufacturer: UTAS Model: XTR-12 Action: Semi-automatic Caliber: 12Ga   Barrel Length: 18.5"" Finish/Color: Black Grips/Stock: 5 Position Collapsible Capacity: 7Rd Manufacturer Part #: XTR12BM1"

665,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6702665,For Sale:  SERIOUSLY!! GET OVER IT!,"EVERYWHERE, Columbus, Ohio",FREE,"Listed On: Tuesday, April 11, 2017",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Dear who ever the hell you are, with no life what so ever, ptobably living in your mothers basement, inhaling a super large meat lovers pizza, get the hell over it man!! You are appealing to absolutely no one and making your self look like a cheap, poor bastard that has buyers/sellers envy as your always complaing about prices! Your prolly the same douche that sends offers and claim that no matter the condition of the firearm they are only worth 80% of the lowest listed price online! Get over yourself! There are some people who actually want a ""brand new condition"" or ""unfired"" firearm but are looking to save some cash so why would someone go pay retail, then sales tax, or if ordered online for ""the lowest price,"" then pay shipping and FFL in 90% of the online sales, when they could save the taxes and then some, save shipping costs and FFL transfer, and save the wait time for those who are to impatient to shop online and wait! Some people (the majority) would like to save upwards of $100 + on the same condition of firearm they can go buy in the store. That $100 + pays for a holster, sights, accessories, etc. Yes there are some that are excessive as in listed over store price in which case i agree, however if the majority offer a mint firearm with minimal rounds or no rounds fired then offering it on the used market for $100 + under store price is a good deal for the majority. As for your used car comparrison, thats not exactly true as in buy it, drive it off the lot, drive it back on and see what you get. 99% of the dealerships have a 72 hr policy so your example is completely wrong! And even if so, its all about the vehicle you buy as is for the firearm you buy. If you go buy a brand new Corvette Z06 ($95-$100,000), put 5k miles on it, resell it 6 months later, you will get $85-$90,000 (less than 10% depreciation on a driven car). You buy a Kia and it will be drmatically different. You go buy a Wilson Combat for $3400, fire 1000 rounds through it, you can resale it for $3100 (less than 10% depreciation fired) and your giving someone a premium firearm at $300 under retail in factory condition (providing you didnt beat the piss out of it). 100% of the people in the market for a brand new Corvette Z06 will take the $10,000 savings for one with 5k miles over buying one with 0 miles for retail! Same situation with firearms. If someone is in the market for a specific firearm they will take a 10% discount for one that looks and performs just as a brand new one! Just because you cant /wont pay the asking prices on armslist does not mean everyone else should follow your lead! Instead of sitting here wasting your time preaching your bs and wondering why your mom said she wished she would have swollowed, be productive, go complain about Veteran homelessness, go complain about youth homeleness, go preach about addolesent drug abuse, go complain about domestic violence, go complain about something other than fucking firearms! Someone asking $1000 for a firearm thats at Vance's for $1,199.99 is not harming nor effecting ANYONE...PERIOD! What is harming and effecting millions, homelessness, drung addiction, drug abuse, child abuse, domestic violence, etc.!! Make your voice heard where needed, you ranting about firearm postings......you truely are a load your momma should have swollowed!With that said, Hey guys, I have a brand new, unfired Glock 19 Gen 4 in Magpul Dark Earth posted up. Check out the ""listings by this user"" and get back to me. Thanks!"

The gun as of this minute is fully functioning, sporting an 18"" barrel and a Mesa Tactical AR-15 buffertube stock adapter pistol grip. The gun can be customized anyway you like pistol/rifle or ""firearm"" due to the receiver not being specified as any thing other than 12 gauge shot shell receiver. If you want a bada$$ shotgun this is it. Every time I've taken it out for testing it's gotten some serious attention, especially when you throw a 30 round drum on her. The action is very smooth operating and it's quite fun to shoot. Photos coming soon."
