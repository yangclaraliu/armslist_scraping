This means it shoots right side up, upside down, sideways, clean or dirty. Trust me, I tried them all. You can limp wrist it to failure but not without being dangerously irresponsible. GLOCK pistols are the Kalashnikovs of the handgun world. GLOCK doesn’t release a gun to market until it can eat tens of thousands of rounds reliably, and the G43 is no exception. If you need so many bullets to deal with your problems perhaps you should consider finding yourself a better set of problems.The G43 is plenty accurate for any reasonable defensive application. If you are trying to shoot something at 50 meters or more, you should have brought a different tool. The G43 has the same consistent, striker-driven 5.5-pound trigger pull common to all standard GLOCK handguns so unlike most other pocket guns, it’s actually easy to shoot well as a result."

It is a high-quality gun and so few were  made that there is very little information available about them. The 160 has a very unique feature unlike any other shotgun we've seen - that is, the action is opened by pulling the trigger. The first pull of the trigger releases the hammer to fire the gun. Pull the trigger again and the action opens. It is an ingenious system and one has to wonder why it didn't catch on. The photo shows the simplicity and sturdiness of the action parts. There is nothing to break or go wrong. This example is 16 gauge and is of extremely nice condition considering it's over 100 years old. Its 28-inch barrel has a shiny bore with just a nickel-size spot of light pitting ahead of the chamber. There is the slightest bit of loosness in the action but the gun is certainly shootable as is and can be easily tightened by a gunsmith. It appears to be of full choke and the top of the barrel is marked ELECTRO STEEL - CHOKE BORED. For anyone who appreciates firearms mechanisms this is a tremendous opportunity to study one of the rarest. For a collector of rarities or curiosa, this one takes the prize!Closeup photos are available to serious buyers.Best to call REDACTED for more information. Sorry, no texts on that line."

The receiver is marked No4 Mk1*, I cannot find an import company name marking anywhere on the rifle.  The metal easily has 80% or more finish remaining, and the stock show some handling but is in very good condition.
The wrist has the letter B stamped below the serial number 99Cxxxx. I've read that this was a British inspection mark applied when the rifle arrived in England, and that the Mk1* ""asterisk"" indicates it has the later ""notch"" design bolt release.  The receiver wrist, bolt, magazine and stock all have matching serial number.  Savage's trademark squared ""S"" is stamped on the receiver and other parts. 
 
Savage Enfields were made from June 1941 to July 1944, and from the checking I've done, the 99C followed by 4 digits dates it to 1944.

I have built this and took it to the range with match ammo to sight it in.  The Zero is set at 50/200 and the BDC reticle is set up this way as well. THAT IS THE ONLY TIME IT HAS BEEN SHOT.  All parts are built and installed to spec. All screws, fasteners and springs are in spec.  Bolts are torqued to proper weight.
This build is flawless, mint condition, no scratches or blemishes.  It has a mid-length gas system and a H1 Buffer.  All you have to do is buy, wait to receive, and shoot.  Everything has been done to get her ready to fight/compete.
The parts list below will show that I have approximately $2,000 into the AR, but you can have the whole package for $1,500 (SHIPPING INCLUDED TO YOUR FFL)
If you have any other questions please ask.  If you are local we can meet up OR I can ship to your local FFL.
I will accept PAYPAL GIFT or ADD 3% but no mention of firearm sale within paypal.  I stand by my work and would not let anything go that I wouldn’t use myself.  Again I HATE to sell this but I don’t have a choice right now.
ALSO:  IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE SCOPE OR THE MOUNT JUST LET ME KNOW AND WE CAN TAKE THOSE OFF.  OTHER THAN THAT IM NOT INTERESTED IN PIECING ANYTHING ELSE OFF AT THIS TIME UNLESS IT IS THE MAJORITY OF THE GUN PARTS..
