The 40cal 5.3in barrel will work on a g23 giving you a longer stainless barrel with a supported chamber able to shoot reloads and lead. Can also use the 9mm barrel in a 23/32 to shoot 9mm . Pretty neat set up giving you many different options . All you need is a 19/23/32 lower and you will have a multi purpose pistol set up with multiple ammo capabilities."

It has a 1-7"" rifling, nitrided barrel (exact same barrel is used in the Sig 516) so you can shoot the heavy pills, and it will last. The Sig sets itself apart from other Direct Impingement M4's in several ways, including that it has no rattle or looseness between the upper and lower, thanks to a tensioner designed in to the lower which is adjustable, so it won't become loose down the line either.  Also has right and left side magazine release buttons, built in quick connects for single point slings, (also supports two point), and a rocker switch for the bolt release that acts as a lock (no more pulling the bolt release to lock the bolt back), also has a flash hider/muzzle brake that has no vents on the bottom so it kicks up less dust when shooting prone to obscure your view. The trigger is fantastic, I've loved it and would get it again, just as it is.This rifle has never been dropped or damaged in any way. I bought it new in the box (also inluded if you wish), and have cared for it meticulously. It has had a lifetime total of 520rds fired through it in four outings, it's not even broken in. Also included are (4) 30-rd magazines, (3) 20-rd magazines, (2) 10-round magazines all are Magpul PMAGs except 1 steel 30rd that came with it new from Sig. There is a Bushnell TRS-25 3moa red dot sight on it right now, and included with a high picatinny riser to bring it to eye level (as pictured). Included is .223 and 5.56 ammo, some very high end rounds (40rds 75gr Hornady TAP, 20rds Hornady Match 75gr., 60rds Mk262 Mod1 77gr SMK w/cannelure, 300rds M855 62gr LAP Green Tip, 40rds 64gr Tracers, 60rds Prvi Partisan 75gr), and an uncle mike's 'tactical' carry bag with 5 magazine pouches and two other pouches. Plus all the original equip., forend, buttstalk, trigger assy, etc.) and boxes the stuff came in if you wish. This is a fantastic carbine in 'like new' condition with a great feel that I love and I'm sure you'll like it too. I think the price is very reasonable, especially considering the Timney trigger, furniture, ammo and extras, but I'll entertain offers. I hate to see it go but I have responsibilities that must take priority. Buyer must pass Oregon background check, as per Oregon law. Cheapest place in town for the background check / transfer is Tigard Pawn @ 99 & Greenberg Rd., $25 last I checked (should verify, I'm not positive on price). It's about 4 miles away from my place.  You will need to pay any transfer fees.$1250 OBO  (Firm)"

I'd maybe separate the optic for the right deal. I'm located in Duluth, but I go down to the cities and western WI often, and Rochester area on occasion. We can work something out.All in the stuff would be around 750+tax & shipping new, but it's not new, it's lightly used so I'd ask 600ish for everything, but I'm very open to offers, cash, trade, trade+cash, whatever, shoot me an offer."

This is a metal finish that is applied through a Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) process. The coating process involves the depositing of diamond-like carbon coatings via a vacuum and an electrical charge. The result is a DLC (Diamond Like Carbon) coating that will provide years of protection against wear while retaining a nice appearance. Ionbond’s unique application process makes it a finish that does not chip, crack or peel as it is a micron level coating. Diamond Black is generally 2 to 5 microns thin. This is not a conventional coating that adds thickness to the material the way ceramic spray paints do. It's an excellent choice for custom fit guns as there is no distortion of details or build up in the corners, which means consistent performance every time. Diamond Black provides the ultimate protection against holster wear, corrosion, bearing surfaces, and rough handling.  Finishing Options; Diamond Black DLC can be applied in several final finishes. Matte; An extremely non-reflective look. Great for hunting guns, M&P, and tactical weapons. Satin; This finish has a matte look, but with a fair amount of ""sheen"". The most versatile application. High polish; Diamond Black allows you to see the finish of the metal below. Polishing to any grit is possible in order to duplicate the finish on factory guns. A high polished finish produces a highly reflective ""show"" type appearance and is a good choice for fine firearms. Colors While Diamond Black DLC is only offered in black, Ionbond produces various coatings of different hardness levels and in several colors. Gold, Silver, and Dark Earth are also available.
