The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. With its 5 Inch Barrel, the Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game.  For this price the revolver also comes with a Kydex holster. This pistol is brand new, it has never been shot outside of the chiappa quality control department.  I bought this for a cool gun to mess around with but have not had time to use it or take it to the range yet and probably won’t have time for a while.

It is chambered in 5.56 NATO and has the stock 1:8 barrel. The only changes I've made to it are added a black Magpul handguard which is included and attached a Vortex SPARC II red dot sight which is a very high quality optic. The RDS along sell for $185 brand new on Amazon. The red dot sight was never sighted in so keep that in mind. The black Ruger AR carry bag that the rifle is laying on in the pictures is also included. It is very basic but gets the job done. Two 30 round magazines are included, both are Magpul and one is the windowed version.I'm only selling due to some recent unexpected costs that I have to deal with. Otherwise this is a rifle of outstanding quality and would be an excellent baseline to add all sorts of new parts to.Please call/text me at 210- four one four-5072 if you are interested in buying or have any questions. I'm asking $600 for the rifle/red dot/carry bag. I'll be happy to send more pics if requested.

This unauthorized Tribute Revolver is a period correct handgun just like the one Detective Hammer (played by David Rasche) used to fight crime on the 1986-1988 TV series. In 1982 Smith & Wesson introduced the 629-1 which no longer used a pin to secure the barrel to the frame. This gun, serial # N937754, was manufactured in 1983. For the 30th anniversary my dad and I put together a numbered run of 5 model correct, fully functional, 6 inch barrel, revolvers that Sledge Hammer would be proud to sleep next to or carry on or off duty. Each comes with a MTM case and Sledge Hammer personnel file. I had the gun inspected, cleaned and test fired by a gunsmith in Phoenix earlier this year. It’s in great shape, NRA Good to Very Good. However, it is a used gun with some minor scratches and comes with no warrantee expressed or implied in any way. I tried to take photos that showed everything. It’s your responsibility to have a gunsmith check yours out before you fire it. Be sure to follow NRA safety protocols when handling firearms. Again I want to stress that I have no connection or affiliation with the show “SLEDGE HAMMER”, its producers, writers, creators, directors, etc. I’m just a big fan of the show and the .44 magnum Inspector Hammer used on the show. If you are too then you will want to bid on this one. The laser etching on the frame and barrel was done by CALIBER ENGRAVING of Brea, California. They also did the laser engraving on the custom made polymer grips that EAGLE GRIPS of Carol Stream, Illinois did such a great job on. The Sledge Hammers on the grips were ink filled by hand."

The Premier Series delivers just that. Think of their Premier Series Rifles as an extension to their Custom Series Rifles, but with standardized features for greater efficiences in parts production and assembly - providing near custom-quality rifles at prices that are affordable to serious shooters. The Premier Series LRP rifle features a Bergara Branded aluminum chassis made in partnership XLR Industries. The Chassis is CNC machined from solid 6061-T6 aluminum, and features an AR15 style grip, adjustable length of pull, adjustable comb height, and the butt plate can be canted to give a precise fit to the shooter in virtually any shooting position. What makes this rifle so special you may ask? Well, Bergara uses Premium 416 stainless steel barrels, which receive a proprietary honing process at their barrel-making facility, at which point they continue through another four stages of production to produce the most accurate production barrel they could possibly make. Upon completion, the barrel receives a Cerakote finish and is coupled with the Bergara Premier action. This process is completed at their facility in Lawrenceville, GA USA. The Bergara LRP weighs around 10 pounds, comes with an AICS detachable five-round magazine, a Timney 517 flat trigger, as well as a Talley 20 MOA rail. The LRP rifle also comes standard with threaded muzzles (5/8x24) and a Dead Air Armament Key Lock muzzle break installed. Barrel lengths range from a 20"" barrel on the .308, 22"" on the 6.5 Creedmoor, and 24"" on the 6mm Creedmoor. It has a guaranteed capability of producing sub-1.0 MOA or better groups at 100 yards with factory match grade ammunition. Every Premier Series Rifle is qualified for accuracy prior to leaving their facility. Each rifle must shoot three consecutive 3-shot groups, all sub-1.0 MOA to qualify. Once completed, they include a copy of the target itself, as well as the information on the factory load used, the date, and the shooter who qualified this rifle.

All three of these are in excellent condition with very minimal use.
_The .22 savage mark 1 has had the sights upgraded and for some reason the front sight is very loose in the dovetail, there is no filing marks on either the sight or in the dovetail so it is a mystery to me, but any gunsmith should be able to fix that, even a spot of locktight would do the trick but it is definitely something to know before you purchase. Comes with a case that is a bit long for the rifle. Worth about $200 used with the upgraded sights
_The Hi point pistol is a .40 and comes with two magazines as well as a small nylon belt holster and a zipped case. It has had less than 500 rounds put through it. Very hefty slide but it is all but brand new. Worth about $130 used with an extra mag
_The Hi point carbine is a 9mm and only has the one magazine. Has had less than 100 rounds fired through it. It's an odd little gun but the sights are very easy to acquire and it is fun to shoot. Comes with an Ar style case with multiple mag pouches. Worth about $220 used
_Bianchi mag pouch is for two 9mm mags which is also included but any mag should fit as long as it doesn't have a huge base pad.
_1200+ rounds of brass cased fmj 9mm, one full box of 9mm jacketed hollow points, a small bag of 9mm blanks the little plastic green ones (don't know why), one full box of steel cased fmj .40s, and two full boxes of .22s all fit nicely into a clean ammo can which is also included. Roughly $300 worth of ammo
These are all my fathers. His eye sight is deteriorating and he decided that instead of these collecting dust and not getting any use we should sell them to someone who would have fun plinking.
Naturally since there is a pistol involved this will be going through an FFL but if you are interested send me a pm with your contact info and we will be in touch to move things along. Asking for $850 for the whole deal and that does not include shipping but it does include the FFL cost on our end. Also, out of state preferred due to the safe act and inability to transfer a registered weapon (the carbine).http://imgur.com/a/tLgfC"

Molded OWB holster. 100 rounds brass case 95gr FMJ, 50 rounds steel case FMJ, 40 rounds 95gr Winchester Elite PDX1. Market value is rapidly climbing on these highly desired models as production is currently on indefinite hold of a new release model due to a “licensing conflict” between Smith and Wesson and Walther. The new release is to be produced in the new Fort Smith, Arkansas factory, if it ever happens. They will also be made with an alloy slide and steel frame. Based upon recent sales and auctions the value of this package is set at relatively firm $800. Some quick research will find that this is the currently asked price for several similar pistols with only one magazine, and they are selling at this level on internet auction sites. I am including everything here for what most people are asking for just the pistol.All applicable laws will be adhered to. Thank you for looking, I look forward to discussing this with you."
