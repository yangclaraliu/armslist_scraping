Ideal for 3 gun matches the Competition Model adds the most critical fundamental enhancements to the standard MR rifle. Foremost among these additions are the new 14-inch Modular Rail System (MRS). Lightweight and easy to customize the MRS allows sections of accessory rails to be added by the shooter where desired but keeping weight down and presenting a more ergonomic and comfortable handguard surface when compared to rectangular full rail systems. An extended magazine release is also included for quick magazine changes. Its innovative compensator by Operator Suppressor Systems Inc. (OSS) replaces the standard MR flash hider. OSS is a leader in the development and manufacturing of sound and flash suppression and uses technologies originated in those fields to create a unique and highly effective compensator. The MAGPUL CTR buttstock is easy to adjust the stock moves smoothly on the receiver extension and locks securely in position. Its profile and weight make this buttstock ideal for competitive shooters. It features a German-made long service barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging technology and H's famous piston operating system this system uses a gas piston and pusher rod in place of the more common hollow gas tube normally employed in direct impingement AR-style rifles.

Nearly identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound less due to its forged aluminum frame making it more comfortable for everyday carry. Equipped with a decocking lever the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no manual safety lever the relatively longer and heavier first round trigger pull requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. There is a safety stop on the hammer as well as a firing pin block safety. It has snag-free fixed 3-dot sights. Other features of the PCR include rubber grip panels serrated front and back straps and a loaded chamber indicator.

Open to cash offers.  Wanting to get a glock 17, glock 19 or glock 26 Here is a lengthy description of both and the package deal Bundle includes 2 items - StrikeFire 2 (SF-RG-501) and VMX 3T Multiplier allowing Red/Green dot selection with 3x magnification. VMX 3T(VMX-3T) features a flip mount to provide the choice of 3x or no magnification. When situations demand split-second target acquisition and maximum field of view, mount up the StrikeFire II and shoot--both eyes open. Feature-rich, versatile and reliable, the StrikeFire II is a great choice for shooters who want a quality red dot sight, but don't want to break the bank. Features sleek rear-facing controls for power on/off and easy adjustment of ten dot intensity levels (5 Green &amp; 5 Red)--lowest two settings are night-vision compatible. Automatically returns to the last dot intensity used when powered up. The 30mm aluminum alloy chassis provides extra-high recoil rating and is waterproof and fogproof. Strike fast! The lower 1/3 co-witness cantilever mount model is ideal for flattop style rifles, positioning the optic bore center 40 mm above the base surface. Simple, fast, effective--the VMX-3T Magnifier will work with any of the Vortex red dots but it is not recommended for use with the prism scopes. The push-button design of the VMX-3T engages and disengages the flip-mount, allowing the magnifier to lock in place. The result, 3x magnified or unmagnified views at will. Optics are fully multi-coated for optimal light transmission. Lightweight and tough; hard-coat-anodized machined-aluminum construction ensures durability. Internally nitrogen purged for reliable waterproof/fogproof performance. Ultimate magnified versatility for virtually any Flattop Rifle height red dot sight. Allows for lower 1/3 or absolute co-witness mounting heights and is ideal for shooters who want to increase the effective range of their red dot sight."

Just bought it new on 4-14-17.  Only reason I'd like to sell it is because I changed directions and want to put money into another firearm I have my eye on.  I paid a big chunk of money for this and I'd like to sell it but I'm open to trade for something I may use more often.  Like a Beretta or Browning Citori O/U 12ga or equivalent, PS90 , AUG , x-95 tavor , Pre-ban or pre-1994 Beretta 92fs INOX ,  Open to other stuff too, even multiple gun trades, just  has to be worth it  for me to consider a trade...... I paid $1198.94 plus tax, $1294.86 out the door.  I'd like to keep the trade value close to that..... Cash price is $1120ish..... Let me know what u have. Thanks."

The adjustment mechanism has detent positions, so the adjustments are repeatable, unlike adjustable gas blocks that rely on a simple screw (which you need to loctite otherwise it will back out, so those aren't adjustable after the first time you set it). For example, say you tune it for the weakest .223 you shoot. Write down how many clicks that adjustment was from fully closed. Then tune it for, say, a hotter 5.56 round that you also shoot regularly. Write down how many clicks that was from your 'weakest' ammo setting. And so on. Then you can optimize the gas setting for whatever ammo you happen to be shooting with a click-turn of the adjustment screw. Particularly cold day? No problem, back the adjustment screw out a click or two. Without a detent adjustment screw, you're forced to set the screw for enough gas for the weakest ammo in the coldest conditions you'll shoot, which leaves you overgassed in all other conditions.The gas block was modified by a gunsmith to include a pin, which further secures the gas block in place. To be honest, I've never had a problem with just set screws, but then again, I dimple the barrel for the set screws. In any case, this gas block can be secured using only the set screws (simply remove the pin) or using both the set screws and the pin.This is the Gen 2 version, so no release button that needs to be depressed as in the Gen 1.Trade possibility: I will trade for a 0.625 adjustable gas block (must have detent adjustment, like Syrac or SLR gas blocks)."

In fact, all the early gun makers did their best to produce special guns to compete in live pigeon shoots and later, trap shoots. Remember, at the turn of the century the shooting sports were a societal highlight, a game for the well-to-do, and well attended and reported in all sporting journals of the day. Parker was well established when along came the game of Skeet in 1926. Parker developed a Skeet configured gun that they sold in all grades save the lowly Trojan. Any double they made after 1925 that had a single selective trigger, ejectors, beavertail forend, 26""-28"" barrels with open chokes would have been called a ""SKEET GUN"". Early guns made before 1937 did not have the ""Skeet In; Skeet Out"" markings on the barrel flats. Skeet guns could be ordered with any style stock available and many had checkered butts, others were ordered with recoil pads to reduce the effects of accumulated recoil, much like Parker's Trap configured guns. This VHE Skeet gun, sn236705 built in 1935, was shipped with the above-mentioned extras including the checkered butt and is a factory documented skeet gun with a Parker Gun Collector Ass. Letter as part of the package. They only made 291 VHE Skeet guns in 12ga., so this is a rare find. The gun is fully restored with awesome Doug Turnbull case colors, 99%+ restored wood and blue finishes, it shows almost as a new Parker gun with every finish historically correct to Parker factory specs. BEWARE OF THE MANY PARKERS THAT HAVE BEEN UPGRADED to “skeet configured” guns after leaving the factory with aftermarket beavertail forends and represented as an original SKEET GUN. They are far more numerous than the original. Parker Skeet guns are perfect for upland game over dogs, grouse and woodcock, quail and also are competitive on the skeet fields. With the long, graceful beavertail forend they are pleasing to the eye as well. These guns just keep getting more valuable, and the Parker Skeet gun will always be highly desirable and a great investment quality gun from an icon of American gun making. Thanks for lookin"

Comes with three 5 round magazines, as well as the picatinny rail attachment you see in the photo (rifle comes stock with dovetail scope mounts). This rifle is, for most intents and purposes, a brand new rifle. I literally bought it, put it in the safe, and that is where it has been for the last year and a half. Never fired it. I thought (and still think) that this is a neat little rifle chambered in an (relatively) inexpensive round to shoot. Its a nice complement piece, IMO, if you already own a SKS or AK variant rifle. I prefer NJ buyers, but might be willing to hand deliver to a FFL somewhere close by in PA or Delaware. NJ buyers must have valid NJ firearms purchaser ID card (obviously). Price is negotiable."
