Original Hungarian FEG receiver. numbers matching bolt carrier, bolt and trunnion. US made 16"" barrel shoots very well. I have a 12.5"" AMD65 as well that has the original hungarian barrel on it and this U.S. barrel shoots just as nicely and obviously a bit better at range. Has brand new NOS FEG fat checkered grip in back and a new NOS FEG wood grip up front. The stock is an old surplus eastern europe solid beech that I refinished with clear poly semi-gloss sealant. This wood furniture and hardware has cost over $100 extra. 
Will come with a croation steel mag as well as a U.S. poly mag that the rifle orginally came with. Will also come with the surplus Hungarian plastic grips and the original U.S. poly stock. I prefer buyer to have a CCW license but I'll accept any other issued photo ID. I'll require a signed bill of sale but that will stay strictly in my posession for personal record keeping.

It would be created in Radom, the same birthplace of the P64. It would be replaced by the P-83 around 1983, on account of its enhanced ammo capacity. It was constructed to be similar in design to the Marakov and to take the same bullet type. It's still used today, in limited quantity, by police and military forces in Poland.Blued steel frame for corrosion resistanceBoth single and double action"

Just traded my AR so no longer need it. It will come with a Burris PEPR mount that it was shot with. Asking $175. This price is fair. I have searched for the cheapest prices and brand new you can get the optic for  about $220 and the mount $60. So before you message me saying the item is used and you will give me $25 know that I have already compensated the 100 rounds shot by pricing it almost $100 less.

It helps absorb sweat during the warmer months here in florida and will be removed prior to sale if buyer requests it. Also helps with repeating proper cheek to stock weld when shooting. Can leave it on so so you will have a general idea of where to put a replacement piece.At the base of the stock, under the tan patch you may notice it is darker, this is grip tape to assist with positive hold on butt of weapon during prone or bench rest shooting.Under the forearm I installed a Mag pul picatinney rail to mount accessories to. I had a Magpul Angled Fore grip and it did help with unassisted prone firing. I will include the angled fore grip if requested at no additional charge.If you want to see the accuracy testing I did with this rifle earlier this year, join the Ruger American Rimfire group on FB.

I inherited all of this stuff from my grandfather who was a gunsmith. I have set aside all that I want to keep so the rest is up for sale. I am a VERY busy father so I would much rather just sell all of this as one big lot rather than piecing it out but I am by no means planning to just give it away by accepting ridicules offers, so don't offer a few hundred bucks and expect me to accept it. I have already researched every item in this listing to get a value and a Conservative total is $1500. I have priced everything below the prices I found online so that I know I am offering you the lowest price. I am accepting any REASONABLE cash offer as well as trade offers but I will be expecting a higher than cash value offer in your trades. Please do not send messages asking what I want in trade because I don't have specific items in mind other than possibly firearms. Just let me know what you have to trade and we'll go from there. I will be including a few extras to the person who buys it all like a pistol rack and some gunsmithing tools/accessories. LET’S MAKE A DEAL!
