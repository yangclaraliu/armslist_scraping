The shotgun has been carried a lot over the years but shot very little.  It was used almost every year for spring and fall turkey season.  The stocks have scuffs and scratches from being carried.  There is NO crack on the underside of the forearm, very common on older Browning’s. No wear showing on the trigger.  The gun has a 28” full choke barrel.  Most older Belgium made Browning’s that had a full choke have a 30” barrel.  The shorter 28” barrel is much nicer to shoot."

This is not a reworked factory rifle it is a hand built full custom rifle, and it performs as such..308 Win. Stiller action (custom Reminton 700 clone), Bartline fluted 20"" barrel with 5R rifling and a 11.25"" twist, custom muzzle break (recoils less than 22LR), McMillan A5 stock (black white, and grey marble swirl), Badger bottom metal, Accuracy International 5 round magazine, Jewel trigger at about 1.5-2 lb's, SPUHR ISMS scope mount, Steiner Military 34 MM tube 5-25X56 first focal plane scope with MSR reticle. This rifle shoots lights out, well below .5 MOA with facrory ammo, and the attention to detail in it's construction is evident as soon as you look at it. The rifle is like new and has only fired 5 or 6 5-round groups and maybe 10 rounds shooting hogs from box blind. All in all less than two boxes of ammo (40 rnds) have been fired through it. Everything you see pictured is included and I do not want to seperate it. Sacrifice at $6,000 OBOThe asking price is more than $2,000 below what it would take to duplicate this set up. The scope alone sells for over $3,200 new right now, and that's a sale price from the usual $3,700. The only reason I'm selling it is that all I really do any more is deer and hog hunt from a box blind and this is way over kill for that. I thought I would use it for long range competitions, but my cometition days are over. I would much rather have the cash in my bank acount than the rifle sitting in the safe not getting used.Call, or text at: eight three two, six nine three, zero zero nine five"
