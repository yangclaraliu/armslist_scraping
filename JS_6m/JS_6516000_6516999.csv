Those things are currently on the rifle and make it look and feel better in my opinion so I consider those must have upgrades but they did cost me money so some of that will be added to the list price obviously.

The asking price for the complete rifle would be $1,100 which is a very good price for a complete rifle with those accessories if you know .308 rifles! Now I also have the Vortex 6-24x50 FFP scope and the Midwest Industries QD mount if wanted but those bring another $1,100 into the equation. I have three 25 round gen 3 pmags and one 10 rounder which I will sell for $75 for all four. I also have around 500 rounds of quality boxed factory ammo if wanted also and I will sell all for .50 a round and there is some match grade ammo included in that count. My only trade interest at this time would be a CZ 805 bren pistol or a 300 blackout pistol."
