We have an  early 1968 production model 70 in .375 up for trade. MAY sell, but rather turn this one into something(s) different. He likes both the classics as I do, and also the modern, current production styles. If Hog Zilla is tearing up your yard, if you have a grudge against a particular deer,  if something escapes from Barnum, and Baileys, or if you just like recoil, and muzzle blast, we have your medicine! Bausch and Lomb scope,  and bases included. Very nice rifle. Let us know what you are thinking,  and thanks for your time, and interest!"

The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from the highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9mm pistols ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety.
The PF-9 retains the best features from the P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

The only “con” of one of these is the price. And that’s because Law Tactical has a monopoly on folding AR adapters. Please google this device, to see more pictures and learn more about it.

I would also consider quality pistols, ARs and any reasonable offer.
This rifle is in 95% condition or better and would great for hunting or just to collect.

Pursuant to Penal Code section 32310, subdivision (c), a person who legally possesses a large-capacity magazine shall dispose of that magazine by any of the following means prior to July 1, 2017: (1) remove the large-capacity magazine from the state; (2) sell the large-capacity magazine to a licensed firearms dealer; (3) destroy the large-capacity magazine; or (4) surrender the large-capacity magazine to a law enforcement agency for destruction.Your options are:1. Remove the magazine from the communist zone of California (SELL THEM TO OUT-OF-STATE BUYERS such as myself), OR send them to family and friends in FREE states.2. Sell your magazines to an FFL in the communist zone of California3. Destroy it (in other words, flush your hard earned money down the toilet.)4. Give it to Law Enforcement to be destroyed (again flushing your money down the toilet. Also, you just KNOW that Officer Friendly is going to keep those mags for himself, don't you. I guess in a way, should you go this route, you are essentially contributing to even more enslavement of yourself by providing FREE magazines to the very people who will ultimately use them against you should you ever get out of line and demand your rights. Considering you've allowed your state ""representatives"" to destroy your rights thus far, it won't take much to finally extinguish what little remains.)LET'S CONSIDER OPTION #1. Message me for pricing of your mags (depends on condition, make/model, capacity, quanitity). Price quote based on your photos, description, quanitities, condition and mutual agreement. Once received, inventoried and checked over, your payment will be sent via USPS Money Order (cashable at your local post office)."

This is one of the rarer models in the REMINGTON NYLON 22 rifle series. I would grade the condition overall as very good condition. The metal is outstanding. The stock has one noticeable scratch but the rest could be restored back to like new. The fellow I bought the rifle from had a low profile scope mounted on it which made it necessary to remove the rear sight. Consequently, the rear sight got lost in the shuffle. Notice the screws remain but the rear sight must be hunted down on the Internet. I believe it is available at a cost of $50-100. There are modern options available but the original would be great. If you are happy with putting a vintage scope back on then that is a good option also.    I will sell this rifle outright for $465. I don't mind trading but I have only a few guns I am looking for and they must be in excellent condition. I like 410 ga shotguns, stainless steel revolvers, silver coins and silver bullion. I also like LEVER action rifles.   I live in Muncie. I don't mind traveling a little if necessary.

Picture of the target is 300 yards, standing with a wobbly tripod, shooting fairly fast (pulled the trigger immediately after the site settled). Get an SBR stamp and you can toss a stock on.

FREE SHIPPING Born of the traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken! Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver.

I would rate the bore as good (strong rifling, no pitting, shiny but not bright). I usually see Finn capture 91/30's with bores resembling sewer pipes so I'd consider the condition of this bore a huge plus. There is a 1"" counterbore as well.

Generation 1.2. This is the second model of the Gen 1 series, which means that it has a better trigger and better sights than the very first model (which was dang near unusable).Well used, well loved.This is a great little pistol. I carried the little monster for a few years before upgrading to a larger caliber. I currently have no use for it, and have another gun on my wish list that I need funds for. I have no clue how many rounds I've ran through it (quite a few), but it has never once jammed or had a malfunction of any sort, even with reloads. Reliable and accurate as all heck. At 5 yards I can keep the whole mag in a 3"" circle consistently, and usually closer to 2"". Off a bench it'll shoot better, but that's not what this gun is made for. Crimson Trace laser works fine and has a new battery. These lasers are extremely handy for a pocket pistol with admittedly minimal sights. Also very handy for dry fire practice (the laser lets you easily see if you're twitching or moving when you pull the trigger).Comes with original box for the gun (including the stuff that came with it, like the manual and the little zipper bag) and the CT laser, 3 mags, and a DeSantos Superfly pocket holster. Fits right in the back pocket of jeans, and won't tilt or rotate on you with this holster. Very nice and simple design.Asking $350 for the whole package. I know that there are a couple of newer models of the LCP currently, but a new setup like this would cost you over $550 (~$230/ gun, ~$200/laser, $40/holster $50/mags). To get the LCP/CT package new (using this model LCP) at sportsmans its $480, with one mag and no holster).Call or text REDACTED if you're interested. Texts get answered faster due to my work, but if you call then leave me a message and I will get back to you ASAP."
