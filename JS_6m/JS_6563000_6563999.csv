I've had it for 3 years and the round count is only 100... time to go.MSRP on these in stainless is $699 and I couldn't even find any of them online for sale right now, so I think that $500 is fair. The price is firm and I'm not interested in any trades... just clearing out some space."

So why so much? I went on ebay and looked at completed listings for these cards. Between Dec 11 and Mar 3 76 cards sold for a total of $384. 80% of that $384 was before shipping cost. The cards sell between $3-11 each. These would be perfect for resale. These cards were received on a subscription basis in 1998-99 where new cards would be delivered every month. The first purchase included 210 cards, so 345 are the rarer cards because people would lose interest and stop paying the subscription fee. There have to be cards in here for certain firearms that will sell instantley for the $11 or more depending on how rare or popular they are. Reason I am selling is because I really don't want to sell these card by card, I will but would like to see if anyone is interested before going that route. I already had an ebay business that I was bought out of and I don't want to get started again. In the pictures I posted I took the first individual card from each catagory, so they weren't specally picked. All cards are in excellent condition.Thanks for the couple of the stupid comments. At the very least 555 X $3 = $1665. Your Laziness or Stupidity sounds like a personal problem."

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).Product Name  CZ 75 SP-01 – 9mm   SKU  91152   Firearm Type  Handgun  Chambering  9mm Luger   Magazine Capacity  18   Magazine Type  Double Stack   Frame  Steel   Grips  Rubber   Trigger Mech  DA/SA   Sights  Fixed Night Sights   Barrel  Cold Hammer Forged   Barrel Length  4.6 in   Weight  40.7   Overall Length  8.15 in   Height  5.79 in   Width  1.46 in   Safety  Manual Safety, Safety Stop on Hammer, Firing Pin Block Safety We accept visa/mastercard/discover at a 3% loss of cash.

(Add $75 For G-10 Grips) The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.6” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).Product Name  CZ 75 SP-01 Tactical – 9mm   SKU  91153   Firearm Type  Handgun   MSRP  $680.00   Chambering  9mm Luger   Magazine Capacity  18   Magazine Type  Double Stack   Frame  Steel   Grips  Rubber   Trigger Mech  DA/SA   Sights  Fixed Night Sights   Barrel  Cold Hammer Forged   Barrel Length  4.6 in   Weight  40.5 oz   Overall Length  8.15 in   Height  5.79 in   Width  1.46 in   Safety  Ambidextrous Decocking Lever, Safety Stop on Hammer, Firing Pin Block Safety  We accept visa/mastercard/discover at a 3% loss of cash.

I have the original 7 Round grip that I also will include also just in case you want to change it back. What the grip extender looks like is in the picture right now. The shield comes with the original box with a slide lock also. I just got this gun not so long ago and would say it has less than 200 rounds through it. Please feel free to make an offer. Worst I would say is no thank you but I honestly would rather sell. I wouldn't mind negotiating a price to sell also.
