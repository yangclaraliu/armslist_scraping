Serial numbers match and nothing appears to be crossed out or changed after original manufacture, to my limited Mosin knowledge. This gun was purchased from Shooters of Columbus, Georgia two years ago and lightly used. Everything about the gun works just fine. There are some rough spots on the finish, some scratches, and a bit of cosmoline can be found on random places, which is to be expected. Not really a pretty mosin, but a fun plinker. I will throw in a spam can (Don't laugh at me, we were at the range and couldn't open the can normally so we had to stab it open with the mosin bayonet) that has around 250 rounds left. I'm not sure of the actual count, but its definitely enough for many range visits. 
I am asking for 150$ firm. Gun was bought new for 140 and the 440 round spam can was 130 dollars unopened. Not looking for trades in any way.

If you want a high quality, accurate, reliable sidearm which will probably last for your lifetime and the lifetimes of your children, the H&K USP Compact will fill the bill. It has great ergonomics and low recoil compared to other pistols of the same caliber. The trigger on the USP is crisp and is very rewarding every time you pull it. The reset is seriously underrated and is one of the best stock reset triggers in the business. 
BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE USP:   The 'Universal Self-loading Pistol' was designed to incorporate many features that the military and law enforcement agencies deemed vital. It uses the Browning cam-breech-locking system. The USP has various safety options. The double-action (DA/SA) V1 have a decocking lever / safety-only lever on the left side of the frame. 
H&K PATENTED RECOIL REDUCTION SYSTEM:    The internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and component service life. Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability and minimum 20,000 round service life of the famed USP45 series with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols.REVIEW   www dot youtube dot com/watch?v=39H15uWVhhw&t=14s"

$900 firm in cash or higher in trade.  
Prefer cash right now, but might consider trades, depending on the deal.  Please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??  If you don't mention a cash amount or other item(s) either way, I will assume you want a straight trade and respond accordingly.
Mostly interested in semi-autos, but will consider others, depending on the deal.  Not really looking for anything in particular, except for the AR FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger & Law Tactical Gen 3-M folding adapter.  Also, a 9""+/- 5.56 upper, a few side charging uppers, 9mm stripped lowers similar to the Joe Bob's Spartan I have now and maybe an AR pistol in .45ACP or parts.
Must be legally able to own a firearm in TX.  Please, no lowballers, scammers or flakes!

And a 12"" free float handguard. Comes with one lr/Sr pattern 20rd pmag. This gun has only had 25rds shot through it to function test and demonstrate it's lack of recoil. It's is ridiculously soft shooting. I wish I could keep it but there are other guns I would use more. I just don't have the time to make it to the range to shoot unless I'm competing or preparing to compete. That's why this gun hasn't been used. The only thing missing from this gun is the forward assist, dust cover, and whatever scope you decide to use.

$700 firm in cash or higher in trade.  Or $760 with the Raven Concealment Magwell(cost $95+ new) included, cost for this pistol and parts/work new would be well over $1,000.  Pics included both ways.  Just let me know if wanting the RC Magwell if offering a trade.  If not wanted, I will just use it on another Glock.
Prefer cash right now, but might consider trades, depending on the deal.  Please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??  If you don't mention a cash amount or other item(s) either way, I will assume you want a straight trade and respond accordingly.
Mostly interested in semi-autos, but will consider others, depending on the deal.  Not really looking for anything in particular, except for the AR FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger & Law Tactical Gen 3-M folding adapter.  Also, a 9""+/- 5.56 upper, a few side charging uppers, 9mm stripped lowers similar to the Joe Bob's Spartan I have now and maybe an AR pistol in .45ACP or parts.

This pistol is as good as it gets in the accuracy department. Looks plain Jane but will out shoot any factory custom on the market, including the popular high priced guns. This gun is worth over $3000 and has only been fired for testing. Doug Jones is a well known 1911 professional gunsmith who builds and services nationally known competition organization guns on a regular basis and inherited the rights to the ACC-U-RAIL system which is widely used on the competition circuit. The accurail is design feature that runs the length of the slide, taking up any play in the slide's movement to improve accuracy and give the gun a solid, tight fit versus the traditionally loose frame/slide fit on most 1911s. If you are looking for a real sleeper (and a pretty one) that will make your buddies jealous, this is it.The frame is a full size Caspian Arms Government model, which includes:A 5"" Kart National Match barrel and bushingsKensights adjustable sightsWilson Combat internals and triggerVZ gripsDoug Jones AccurailFeel free to make a cash or trade offer."

Pmag.  This is a new unfired rifle that I never got around to doing anything with because of other projects.  I chose this particular AR-10 because I wanted a bit more range than a 16"" barrel would give and the medium contour barrel keeps the rifle as light as possible without compromising accuracy.  The only one I could find currently listed was one on Gunbroker for $1,650 in the same stock configuration.  I do have aftermarket pistol grips and stocks I can add for a little extra, just let me know.
$1,300 firm in cash or better in trade.  This one cost well over $1,500 after tax and it's still new.  Not going to be interested in trades unless the value is there, Thanks.  
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56, another 9mm stripped lower, side charging uppers and cash or??  
If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.  If you don't mention cash or other either way, I will assume you want a straight trade.  
Must be able to own a firearm in TX.  I can ship insured to another TX resident for $30 more.
Thanks for looking!"

In short, this combat pistol was designed to be perfect for any tactical use, including home- and personal defense, tactical competitions as well as duty carry in any condition. One of the most salient benefits of the M9A3 is its universal slide, which is easily convertible from FS to G mode. This means that the M9A3s safety lever can be used in a safety-decocker mode or it can be converted to perform a decocker-only function for those who prefer this configuration. More versatility is also offered in the form of a removable front sight, for tactical shooters who have a distinct preference in terms of sight picture, material or construction. In addition, a variety of accessorization options is possible thanks to the built-in 3-slot Picatinny rail located in front of the trigger guard, which enables the easy attachment of a variety of tactical lights, laser devices and more. The M9A3 was designed to be used in the heat of combat. For this reason, Beretta has put a generous bevel at the magazine well, so that tactical magazine changes may be performed quickly and easily with one hand, regardless of lighting conditions. Along the same lines, the magazine-release button is oversized, making it simple to use when seconds count even while wearing gloves. And the M9A3 is low-maintenance thanks to its hyper-resistant FDE finish that is practically impervious to the elements, sand-resistant magazines in 15 or 17 rounds (10-round standard), and intuitive tool-free disassembly. Whether it’s on duty, at home, for concealed carry or at the range, the M9A3 will always give you the absolute best of Beretta’s centuries-old experience and long history serving the needs of professionals the world over.Kentucky Residence with valida drivers license"

$550 firm in cash or best trade offer will be considered.
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56, another 9mm stripped lower and side charging uppers.  I'll even consider PSA(or similar brands) pistol uppers and $250-$300 cash, depending if new or used, since I can buy most of those new complete from PSA for around $300 shipped.  
If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.
No scammers and must be able to own a firearm in TX.  Can ship the upper anywhere for $20 more"
