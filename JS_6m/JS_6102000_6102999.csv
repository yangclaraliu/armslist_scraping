It has a 5.5” barrel and is in the relatively scarce .38 Colt caliber (offered from 1886 to 1929, but very few after 1922). As a one gun shipment, it was most probably a special order, and with wood grips long after hard rubber was the norm. The grips on the gun are apparently typical two-piece of the period, but may or may not be factory (right hand escutcheon is replaced). The bore is extremely good, as are the mechanics, with very tight lock up and all four clicks. It was obviously well used, but taken care of and not abused. Judging from the upside-down ampersand stamped on the right rear trigger guard, it was returned to the factory for work. It has over-stamped serial numbers, and it may or may not have been re-stamped then. Buffing and/or part replacement would have prompted the re-stamping of numbers. The bore is the older, larger diameter (about .370”) and the cylinder will chamber .38 Short Colt, .80 Long Colt, and .38 Colt Special as well as .38 S&W Special.Accompanying the Colt is its Abercrombie & Fitch flap holster (probably made by H. H. Heiser of Denver, Colorado). This would indicate a New York gentleman’s gun and not one destined for the Wild West. Also with the gun are pictures of the Abercrombie & Fitch building on Madison Avenue and 45th Street, as well as an interior picture of the gun department taken the same year the Colt was shipped. There is also a brief history of A&F, formed in 1900 and in business to this day, and a vintage catalog cover.For someone wanting to shoot this pistol, we will supply a summary of ballistics information available on the .38 Short Colt. This caliber is the grandfather of the .38 Special and .357 Magnum, and originally evolved from Colt’s cartridge conversions of the 1851 Navy in .36 caliber percussion (cap and ball). Cartridges are also available.Our prices reflect a 4% discount for cash or certified funds (Cashier’s Check, USPS Money Order – no Western Union or other type money order). Credit card payments do not receive this discount. We can take VISA or MasterCard, and will consider trades for U.S. gold and silver coins at spot value.

Micro slides are made to the tightest allowable tolerances, with barrels machined from stainless steel for superior resistance to moisture. All Micro frames are shaped from the finest aluminum for integrity and strength. In many respects a miniature 1911, among the most important Micro design advantages is a single action trigger with the kind of short, smooth pull that ensures accuracy and builds confidence. The thumb safety, slide release and magazine release are pure 1911 as well. Standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Night Sights are steel – not plastic – and mounted in machined dovetails for additional integrity.

This has been my project car.  The pros- This little lady may have some years on her, made by Chevy in 1989, but her engine is as strong as an ox. 8 cylinders, 305 cubic inches of raw muscle will get you where you want to go. Original transmission and engine, nothing rebuilt there, they used to make these ladies the right way. 120k miles. New this year: both headlights, starter, alternator, MAP sensor, spark plug wires, oil, oil filter, air filter, one tire and battery. The interior is excellent, no rips or tears in fabric, never smoked in, the ride is so smooth you'll think you're sitting on your grandma's couch. The cons- Her AC unit needs to be recharged, she blows, but not cold. The radio is factory Delco but does not work, tuner is burned out but speakers still get power. If I had more time to fix it up I'd put a CD/AUX player in. She was left out in the cold for too long and her paint isn't what it used to be, if I were keeping her she'd get a pearl paint job. The plastic bumper connectors rotted off out in the elements but the mounting hardware is still there. If someone had $800 or so to put in, you could make this old girl the belle of the ball again. I know what I have in it so what I'm asking is fair. It its current condition it is worth $2000. Ill trade for handguns plus cash on your end. No junk guns; Jimenez, high points, stars etc. no black powder, no archery. what I'm really wanting is an FN Scar in 7.62, an M14/M1a in 7.62 or a milled AK a la Arsenal in 7.62x39."

Now when i squeeze the trigger it will not fully depress and drop the hammer. With the slide off looking down from the top there appears to be a plastic ball bearing with a pin in the middle. The pin appears to be loose which is causing the bearing not to roll forward. Any ideas?""A:""I had the same problem with my TCP, all you have to do is take the slide off the frame, use a punch to ""push"" the retaining pin back inn, clean the area and apply a small drop of locktite or whatever glue you see fit for the occasion. That is what I did and it solved my problem. What is happening is that when you pull the trigger, it wobbles side to side, add to that the vibration of a live round going off and that is causing the retention pin to work its way out, it will go out so far that it will eventually hit the frame and stop the trigger from rotating all the way. Hope this helps....""CALL REDACTEDItem is located at east side store at 2344 E 5th Ave, Columbus OH 43219."
