However, when the production of Springfield 1903 Rifles became a priority the remaining 1911 frames were shipped to Colt. The serial numbered in the ""Suspended"" range were not recorded as Colt production and no records show what happened to them. This one was purchased in 1938 by my Dad and used as a combat sidearm in WW2 by an Army Officer. It was registered as his weapon and is documented. The US holster he used has a bullet hole that pierced through it. After the war he brought it home. The frame has NO MARKINGS except the S/N and US Property, which is correct. The gun shows that it was well used during the war, but, well cared for in terms of rust or pitting and has original grips i would ship upon request only to an FFL holder."

I'm not in a big hurry to get rid of this rifle nor am I strapped for cash, so try to avoid low ball offers. I do entertain the thought of trades however I'm NOT really interested at this time. At this time, I'm trying to keep this on the south side of Indy or at least near it, at location and time agreed on, and at my discretion. If you have any questions, about the price or anything, the worst I can do is say no. I'll also need to see your IN gun permit, it's not required for the sale and nothing will not be recorded, but I require it, and finally if you have trouble meeting a police station or any federal building, then this is NOT for you. You can contact me through the Armslist 'Contact Seller' tab. Thanks for checking out my ad.Edit Feb. 2: I've been getting emails about interests in trades and with no trade offers, going on record here the only thing I'd be willing to trade at this point in time would be a CZ 75B in ""great condition""; not the CZ75B Omega or a ""Pre-B"" Model. The trade would have to include a few extra MecGar CZ75B magazines, no promags, triple k, or Korean mags, and probably some dosh. Also price drop from $1000 to $900.Edit Feb 17: I've been getting emails about lowest offers and Ill tell you what, I'll make it $700 but I keep the rear sight, the stock, and the five mags 20 round mags; if you're interest just tell me you want the ""cheap version"" and give me your number."

The handguard has a float tube and lead weight under it. It has been rebarreled with a Kreiger 1:7 from Compass Lake Engineering (CLE). The front sight is a CLE windage adjustable with the 4 screw system (as opposed to the WOA 2 screw system). I have several front sight posts and hooded rear apertures, you have your choice of sizes.   This barrel has about 2000 rounds through it probably not halfway through its competitive life. The rifling has good definition right up to the throat. Unlike cheaper button rifled barrels, Kreigers have cut rifling and last about twice as long. and I GUARANTEE it will shoot High Master scores. I retired this upper immediately after Camp Perry 2015 and have not shot it since. (I retire a upper about halfway through its life and use it as a back-up so I always have a first class back-up capable of winning.) My best at Perry 2015 was 23rd out of 1000 in the NTI (I was 7th civilian, ahead of me were 15 full time professional military target shooters). I regularly cleaned 200y and 300y rapids with this upper and shot many HM scores. I even cleaned a 600y slow prone in a practice with this.   This barrel has never seen a bronze brush, nylon only, and it has never seen any abrasive such as bore paste or any corrosive such as ammonia based cleaners, only Hoppes and Bore Tech. It is always stored with a bore wetted with Hoppes and Kriol. I paid over $600 just for the Kreiger barrel, bolt and front sight assy (see photo for receipt)! Note: The delta ring has 2 cosmetic chips, I will include a new one with the rifle.   WOA is getting about $900 for their A4 Uppers with NON-Kreiger barrels with pinned sight carry handles, and they are not in stock! WOA offers no guarantees, no proof, and no refunds. This Complete Upper Assy is proven to be accurate and reliable, guaranteed or your money back. If you are capable of winning, this upper will get you there! I have used WOA button rifled barrels in the past and many are very good (given their shorter life), but some WOA barrels are not as good new out of the box which is why I switched to the CLE Kreiger.
I can ship this, ask for a quote.  Figure $20-40 depending how far you are from NH."

Apparently it was heavily polished and refinished at some point after the war. The grips are late WW2 Walther pressed beech wood. The caliber is 7.65mm (.32 acp) but since these were assembled from unfitted late war parts it should be checked by a gunsmith before firing.""  The pistol spent most of it's life in a drawer in humid Florida, so it has some freckling/pitting on the slide, hopefully visible in the pics.  Priced at $400 for FTF sale in Orlando.  Will ship to your FFL at your expense.  Will trade with cash for Walther PPK or PPK/S in .380."

It has some scracthes on the frame, probably wear from a holster, and it looks like someone who didnt know what they were doing tried removing the rear sight because there are some dings on both sides of the slide just under the rear sight. 
It probably wont bother a lot of people but Im a little OCD so Im going to sell it at a loss. I can send more pics if you like. Price is absolutely firm. No trade offers please, and if the ad is up its still available."

For over 230 years, the name Springfield Armory® has been associated with proven combat arms. This storied tradition continues with the all-new SOCOM 16 CQB. A modernized descendant of the distinguished M14 and M1A™ rifles, the SOCOM 16 CQB is designed for serious defensive use as its Close Quarters Battle name implies. Nearly ten inches shorter than the M1A™ standard model, the CQB offers quick and easy handling for defensive use indoors or out. The authoritative .308 chambering with optional 20-round magazines won’t leave you wanting more fight-stopping effectiveness. If you’re looking for a defensive rifle, you’ll find the CQB outfitted right out of the box with the features that can make all the difference when it counts. The adjustable buttstock, with 5 position length and 2 position adjustable cheek piece, is mounted on a standard AR-type commercial buffer tube, so you can always choose the perfect stock for your needs from hundreds of AR-compatible stocks. The AK-style pistol grip places the exact grip angle and distance desired between the hand and trigger, and the CQB accepts any standard AK-style replacement. The CQB stands ready for the addition of your favorite gear with the M-Lok compatible system. One seven-slot and two three-slot rail segments, factory installed, that can be mounted at the three, six, or nine o’clock positions. Also there is a fixed top rail that provides the perfect location for a scout optic should your needs dictate engaging from a distance. Out of the box, you’ll be ready to hit your target quickly day or night. An XS front post front sight with tritium insert appears effortlessly through the aperture rear sight, and an optional factory CQB rifle comes equipped with a proprietary Springfield Armory® clip guide red dot mount with a Vortex® Venom Red Dot sight which enables fast target acquisition indoors or out. Not to leave out the finishing touches, we’ve packaged this new SOCOM 16 CQB in a custom ballistic nylon tactical case complete with internal supports, owners manual storage, and pockets for up to three magazines. When it comes to protecting the ones you love, trust the First Name in American Firearms, Springfield Armory®.Ground Shipping flat rate $20 for handguns and $25 for rifles and shotguns."

It is a Thunderbird about 20' long with a Evinrude engine. I tried to find the model but couldn't, only that it is from the late 70s (maybe 78). I intended to fix it up, and as much as I'd like to try, I don't have the money or free time, and do not see myself having both for a while. Other bills/life make me think it's better I try to sell.  It will need a good amount of work by subdue who knows about boats, and I'm not it. The boat does not have a title, and will need a salvage title I imagine. I do have the title to the trailer. I did empty the gas tank so no gas is sitting in it. I know the engine has always worked very well in the past, but I believe the wirring needs to be fixed. I do not have the key to the control unit, and could not find the manufacturer. It will be to be rewired, and may need a new throttle control unit if a key can't be found/made. I was told the engine is probably currently such in gear, but I think it has to do with the wiring, not the engine. The hull appears to be in good shape to me. The was never any problems with leaking when it ran, and it was always kept on the trailer. The trailer is in fair shape.  So, obviously the boost needs some real work (see photos) and it's sold as is. The trailer would go with the boat. I am considering giving it to the""boat angels"" if there is no interest in it, but I thought I would post it online first to see what interest might be in it.  I am not a boat person, so what questions I could answer is very limited. It is currently in Williamsburg, and I can arrange to meet people there for serious interest, but only on weekends.Engine Model #: 115899C"

I only took it to the range on one occassion and fired approximately 50 rounds. Traveling as much as I have I never made enough opportunities to take it to the range again, and that is why it hasn't been fired a ton. There has never been any damages or malfunctions with this weapon. I love this handgun due to its handling and weight distribution when firing. Again, I just don't have the time to show it proper love. My foremost concern with the private sale of this weapon is that the person purchasing this gun is capable of doing so legally. Therefore, I prefer to sell only to those interested who have a valid carry permit. I understand that a permit isn't required, so at the very least there will be a bill of sale involved with this transaction. As far as meeting location...I am only interested in meeting in the vacinity of a law enforcement agency at an agreed upon meeting place.
