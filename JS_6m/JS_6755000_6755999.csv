A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver."

The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em.The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver."

Never Holstered. No Meetings No Offers Firm Price and please do not waste my time. Slip cover has wear and tear staining but Blue Box, Foam, & Paperwork are very nice. The discoloration in the blue areas caused by silcone oil rag, blue is near perfect except for the forementioned wear. This Revolver was purchased directly from Mr. Wilkerson - Dealer / Author / Historian, a few years before his death. Great person and endless knowledge on Colt SAA Revolvers. This has the Old Style Caliber and address markings on barrel not the normal stamping. This is not a Storekeeper Model and was made in much fewer numbers for Mr. Wilkerson for his sales. Shipping to FFL Dealer possible - I am not a dealer I have two pending sales one for Monday and if not one on Tuesday and if these fall through will keep listed. Keep in mind that a Mr. Wilkerson Python brought over $40,000 at auction and will be where this one ends up. Price reflects the fact that it has been handled and shot, still nice. NOT THE NORMAL PRODUCTION GUN AND FEW COME AVAILABLE ONCE THIS ONE IS GONE THERE WILL NO BE MORE. I believe Ms. Wilkerson sold the last ones in this barrell length. Maybe a 32-20 still?"

This is the Airweight version of the venerable 442 but in .32 H&R Magnum. Holds 6 rounds vs the standard J frame loadout of only 5. This is for the Smith collector that can appreciate what this gun is. No longer produced or catalogued by S&W, this is sure to go up in value like all the other discontinued Smiths. Not looking for trades. Cash only. Will include box, 2 boxes of ammo and an IWB holster. Price is $500 obro in Lexington."

Only Available in Stores Important Notice Add to Wish List Map Pin Check Store Availability Description The Smith & Wesson® M&P® M2.0™ Semi-Auto Pistol in Flat Dark Earth (FDE) is the successor to the M&P striker-fired, polymer pistol platform used by countless law enforcement agencies and civilians alike for personal defense sidearms. The FDE colored polymer frame of the M&P M2.0 utilizes a rigid, extended stainless steel chassis embedded to frame reduce flex and torque when firing. The pistol comes with 4 interchangeable grip inserts to find the perfect palmswell fit and trigger-to-backstrap length for each individual shooter's hand. A new aggressive texture keeps hand in place, and the original M&P 18-degree grip angle points instinctively on target. The M2.0™ trigger has a light crisp pull and a tactile and audible reset; and a sear deactivation lever allows the weapon to be disassembled without pulling the trigger first. A high grip-to-barrel bore axis reduces muzzle flip to sustain accurate shot placement during rapid fire. The Smith & Wesson M&P M2.0 Semi-Auto Pistol has a stainless steel slide and barrel, finished with non-reflective, corrosion-resistant FDE Armornite®. An integral Picatinny rail provides for the attachment of aftermarket tactical accessories. The M&P M2.0 comes with 2 magazines."
