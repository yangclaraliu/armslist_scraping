I am selling my brand new, unfired, New Jersey compliant Colt 6920. 

I never got a chance to take it to the range.  It was simply purchased and placed into my safe. 

I dont see a point in it collecting dust so I'm listing it for sale.

Pinned stock, neutered bayonet lug, pinned and welded muzzle brake: all the required features that do nothing except make felons out of law abiding citizens.

Also included* is the pictured quad rail and a 44"" Blackhawk Sportster Tactical Rifle Case.  

For some reason, I cant upload more than one pic...

The price is $1190 which is less than I paid for the rifle, shipping, transfer fee, parts, compliance work and Blackhawk case.  

Must have NJ FID card etc etc.

Thank you for looking at my ad.

I have kept this rifle very clean over the years and its been taken care of. Its got a shiney 2 groove barrel, and has the 2 position simple rear sight (300 yard and 600 yard zeros). The magazine feeds very well and over all the rifle is in good shape. She isnt a looker though, there is a small section of the stock fore end that is ""chipped"" for lack of a better word. Also a few shallow pitting marks on the reciver and bolt handle. But overall the rifle is mechanically fine and works. Definitly used in Combat. The rifle was bought like this and must have happened before it came into the US through Century International Arms. I also have 2 box of PPU 180 Grain Soft point. Also have a Savage made spike Bayonet and two Mark 4 charger clips.  I would like to do the trade at my LGS in Loomis."
