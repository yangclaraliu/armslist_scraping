I have a LOT of ammo available to go with it; range ammo, JHP, etc. All factory fresh, no re-loads. I have a lot of the Remington Golden Saber personal protection ammo available, too. I am specifically trying to find and trade for either of two guns. I am looking first for a Springfield Armory XDm9 (full size only, no compacts) or a Glock 17 Gen 4. I realize my gun is not brand new, and I am taking that into consideration when I figure trade value. As I said, I also have a LOT of ammo, so I can make the trade very worthwhile to someone who is looking for a nice stainless .357 that they can legally hunt with in the State of Indiana. Please respond to this ad with information on your trade. I will respond with my phone number and we can go from there and make a deal. I am located on the Southwest side of Indianapolis at Kentucky Avenue and I-465.i have 10 good quality pictures I can text you for close inspection of the gun."

Probably the most noticeable of these features are the grip medallions, which are set into each black plastic checkered grip panel. Alex Sturm himself, who was a student of heraldry, originally designed Ruger’s distinctive trademark “eagle” logo, and at the company’s inception the grip medallions featured a red eagle. Upon Sturm’s untimely death in 1950, Ruger ordered that henceforth the grip medallions would no longer feature a red eagle, in memory of his friend and business partner. The medallions were initially changed to feature a black eagle, and over the years a silver eagle on a black background became the standard. The 50th Anniversary Model invokes the spirit of the original medallions by featuring a silver eagle on a red background. This logo is also set into the bottom of the two magazines that are included. Another feature not seen on Ruger’s .22 pistols since the earliest production models is the contrasting color bolt. Originally, the pistols featured bolts that were unfinished, or “in the white”, to create an attractive contrast with the blued steel receiver. The 50th Anniversary Model features a similar concept, but given that Ruger was a pioneer in the use of stainless steel in firearms manufacture, the bolts are now unfinished stainless steel. This offers the same contrast in appearance without the corrosion problems inherent in unfinished carbon steel. Another difference relating to the bolt is that the Ruger logo is roll-marked on the flat end of the bolt, which is a very attractive touch not included on the current production model. Also, one of the changes Ruger made with the introduction of the “Mark Series” was to begin milling angled flats on the back of the receiver immediately ahead of the bolt’s cocking “ears” in order to make the bolt “ears” easier to grasp. These flats are omitted on the 50th Anniversary Model to give the gun an appearance more like the originals. The 50th Anniversary Ruger logo is roll-marked on top of the receiver, between the barrel and the ejection port, further identifying the gun as a limited-edition model. The 50th Anniversary logo is also reproduced in color on the top of the special red plastic box."

The gun shows very little (if any) wear. The only issue with this gun is that someone (in the past) stamped something on the left side of the frame and maybe someone else tried to stamp it out (see attached picture). Also there is an oval stamp behind the trigger that indicates it was issued to the Bavarian police). Other than that I would call it 90%-95% condition. Grat piece of Walther history. The gun will come with one magazine and sorry no box.The original PP (polizeipistole) was released in 1929. It was designed for police use and was used by police forces in Europe in the 1930's and later.If you have guns of similar value and quality I may consider trades. I wouldn't mind a Smith ""J"" frame or a SAA in 38/357.---------------------This  a face-to-face transaction ONLY - NO SHIPPING ---------------"

It is the weathershield model with the hogue overmolded stock and the stainless steel barrel.  It is chambered in .300 win mag which is the hardest to find of calibers for this gun. No one let's these things go. They were discontinued because of manufacturing costs. The reciver is milled out of a solid piece and took almost 2 hours to mill a single one. It has an adjustable trigger. Also the stock is bedded for accuracy. Since the picture I have added a Nikon prostaff 4x12x40 bdc scope. It has double locking scope rings due to the caliber. Rifle done right ready to take out west elk hunting or get into 500yrd + shooting. I am not in a hurry to sell or trade the gun and won't be sad to keep it. I would rather trade the set up for rifle or pistol but you can shoot any trade by me. I will sell outright so feel free to make me an offer anyway you feel is fair.

I have had it for several years, but have shot it very very little (I'm selling it, because I want something smaller to carry). I acquired it used, and I can't remember how much it was reported to have been fired before I owned it. Judging by the lack of wear I would say it is has not been fired extensively. I am by no means an expert at guessing such things though so I have pictures that I will email to you so you can make your own best judgement (unfortunately I was only allowed 3 images in the listing). The following items are what is included in this listing:• 4 O rings (5 if you count the one on the gun)• A very nice Eagle industries case• Some tools (HK cleaning kit, and something else - hey I kept everything even if I don't remeber exactly what it is - I think you can change out some of the components, which also appear to be in the bag, based on user preference, but again I am unsure)• 2 sets of sights - what I believe are the original sights plus what appear to be some sort of night sights that are currently installed (I'm guessing they are the glowing paint variety and not the fancy insert variety - I see no inserts).  There is a small clear ziploc type bag that I believe the currently installed sights came in which has the following handwritten description: ""10926 H&K USP Tactical Night Sights $150.00"". However, when I Google this description the sights that come up are not what is on the gun - please request pictures from me.• Owner's manual / paperwork• Cable lock (it does not appear to be HK branded)• 7 magazines - these include 3, 12 rounders (1 of which is HK the other 2 are Promag brand) and 4, 10 rounders (2 of which are HK and I don't know what the other two are).Shipping will be from my FFL to your FFL. I will cover my FFL and reasonable freight (I don't know all the rules for every locality so let's just say I'll cover my FFL plus up to $35 for freight) - you will need to pay your FFL and any amount over $35 for freight. I'll ship it anywhere in the US where the local and state governments haven't breached your rights.As far as payment goes I'll take anything that doesn't bounce as long as you cover the fees involved, but whatever it is will have to clear prior to shipment (by clear I mean sitting as cash in my bank account unable to be recalled by any processing intermediary) - in God I trust all others pay cash :-). If you have any questions or conerns please call or text me on my cell at REDACTED - my name is Titus.Thank you for looking!"

It's like new. I did purchase it new from Airguns of ArizonaI've shot only 400 pellets through it. I will be shooting it a little more since I want to get some more use out of it before selling.I have All 4 12 shot Clips It comes with 2 clips but I purchased another 2 which were 30$ eachI'm including in price I'll also sell the Air Tank with the quick disconnect for 225$I'm looking to sell so I can put the money towards an AR. I had a pretty bad fiasco with getting the right attachment for the quick disconnect for the air tank and major shipping delays. This is also the reason why It doesn't have a very high shot count.I originally had a hand pump but returned that and got an air tank. Using an Air tank is really the way to go. You can look up reviews for the air rifle It's pretty accurate and has a very light and crisp trigger pull. I have a sight on it, it's a Vortex Diamond BackI'll include it for 125$ with the rings I will consider trade or partial trade for an AR depending on what it is.I'm looking for more than just your basic ARIf interested I can send additional photosIf shipped payment will need to be made with a money order, cashiers check, etc. You will need to pay the Shipping FeeThis post will be removed once soldPrice is FIRM- David"

Nearly identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter owing to its forged aluminum frame, making it more comfortable for everyday carry. Very similar to the P-01, the PCR uses the same alloy frame minus the light rail, making it even more concealable.Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger pull is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator.SPECIFICATIONSCZ 75 PCR – 9mm Product NameCZ 75 PCR – 9mmFirearm TypeHandgunPurposeConcealed CarryChambering9mm LugerMagazine Capacity 10Magazine TypeDouble StackFrameAluminum (7075 T6)GripsRubberTrigger Mech DA/SASightsSnag-Free Fixed 3-DotBarrelCold Hammer ForgedBarrel Length 3.75 inWeight 27.5 ozOverall Length 7.24 inHeight 5.03 inWidth 1.38 inSafetyDecocking Lever, Safety Stop on Hammer, Firing Pin Block Safety, Loaded Chamber Indicator- Reduced force hammer spring for smooth trigger - Excellent condition. - 949 - four six six - four three zero seven Price is firm."

This was used as my wife's rifle but she just wouldn't get into as much as she thought. I has had about 200-300 rounds through it. It was a very good shooter, but I'm needing extra money to carry us though a rough patch. The rifle has had an LRI bolt shroud installed and a weibad cheek rest. Currently there is an AAC 51t muzzle device installed, which could change based on your preference. This will come with one 20rd Pmag. Lastly, the handguad has been machined to remove about a 2 inch section of railing to allow the optic to sit as low as possible. The handguard was cerakoted sniper grey and looks really nice. The bipod and bipod mounting equipment does not come with it. This rifle had a Vortex PST 6-24x50 EBR MOA scope with bushwhacker caps and a Burris mount on it. This may be for sale with the rifle (not included st $950) or after the rifle sells. I also have hornady dies and brass for $25 extra. I may consider some trades but I have to receive some cash in this deal. This rifle has shot some REALLY nice groups.

Magnum Research is known for making the highest quality large caliber pistols.

The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation, and the front sight is fixed bright orange for fast acquisition. The slide locks back via the magazine after the last round is fired, or can be locked back manually.
Pistol comes with one 15 round capacity magazine, owners instruction manual, and hard carry case.

CONTACT REDACTED!Hello and thank you for viewing this listing! Are you in the market for a running truck with a manual transmission and a very reasonable price tag? This 1994 Cheverolet S10 pickup perfectly fits that description! Being driven by a 206,000 mile 4.3L V6 engine, it's a lot for the money! Your new truck has just had its carpets cleaned and has received a fresh 4 coats of black plasti-dip peelable rubber paint. This truck WILL pass inspection! Clean title! Spare tire, jack, wheel chock and tire lug wrench included! Head unit also included! All lights work beautifully except for the 3rd brake light which has a burnt lense (common on these trucks and will still pass inspection because it is not burnt completely through the lense). The passenger side speaker is functional and the drivers side is not. This truck has AC but I rarely use it and it has issues from not being used very much. The serpentine belt has just been replaced a couple of days ago, along with the air filter! This S10 has a damaged passenger side door handle on the outside of the truck due to a break-in. Both of the doors (on the interior) have missing parts and do not lock. The truck was not professionally painted, so there is overspray which I'm currently working on peeling off of the tires, chrome and windows (easy to do). Rear wheel drive! Driver and passenger side sun visors are damaged and the headliner is being held up by clear tacs in some parts. New, custom-cut rubber floor matts recently placed into truck! Both seats are damaged, but the drivers side has been repaired with duct tape and towels (feels fine)! Original owners manual included! 5 speed! I bought it to have an economical truck that was in great condition for the price that I could work on/take care of and use to learn how to drive a stick shift. It turns out that I've spent more time improving the truck since I purchased it (not long ago) than I've spent driving it. I find myself driving my car (with an automatic transmission) a lot more than the truck. I have over $700 into the truck all together and am willing to take a $100 loss and pass it on to someone else simply because I am not really into driving a manual. In order to test drive, I will need the full amount of cash (or gun/guns) in my hands (I will check for counterfeit money as well). Feel free to contact at any time via TEXT at REDACTED!"
