There are no rust or pitting issues, no handling marks, the color is correct for the era & very few flaws are found under the new finish. Like I stated earlier, most people, including the last owner, would not know it has been refinished."

They are not cheap but you get what you pay for. I am no fan of lasers myself but this one rocks! I wouldn't own any other type.  ( I just put it in the gun in case wifey needed it) All parts are included.

I am looking to sell my Colt Double Eagle. It is a 1991 model Officer's edition MK II Series 90 with a 3.5"" barrel. These guns are somewhat rare as they only were made for a one year time span (1991-1992). This gun was bought new by me in 1991 and has only had about 100-200 rounds shot through it. As you can see in the pictures it looks new. After each time on the range it was taken home and cleaned, oiled, and put back into the safe.
Comes with original carry case, 2X 8 round magazines, and papers.
Would consider cash only. Email with questions and I will get back to you ASAP.

With this upper, your rifle can be packed in a standard backpack for discrete carry. This is the stuff the cool kids have lol!

EZ shooter, accurate and dependable.Must sell / trade as I have developed nerve damage in my hands and can't rack the slide like I did in the past..2ea 15rd mags, AmmoThe GLOCK 20 Gen4, in 10mm, provides nothing short of massive firepower. The use of GLOCK hi-tech polymer considerably reduces felt recoil. With muzzle energy of 550 ft/lbs and a magazine capacity of 15 rounds, this 10mm is your reliable companion on every hunt
For fans of full-size and big-bore handguns, the G20 is a marriage made in heaven. The flat-shooting 10 mm is among the most powerful of the common semi-auto pistol cartridges, providing Magnum-level stopping power for personal protection and hunting. The Glock pistol design is simple, rugged, reliable and can handle the increased pressure levels of the 10 mm cartridge with alacrity.
Of the 10 mm pistols I've had the opportunity to work with, the G20 is the softest shooting. The accuracy is excellent, especially for an out-of-the-box service pistol. The new Gen4 version G20 is more comfortable to work with for smaller hands than the Gen3 because of the reduced grip size, grip texturing and the enlarged magazine release. As one of those shooters who enjoys handguns with plenty of power, the G20 Gen 4 has earned itself a place on my list of favorite guns."

It has a lot of love in it and I built this gun to be what I wanted in a Long Range Target/Hunting Rifle. Firstly, the Base Rifle is a Tikka T3 chambered in .308. The action is smooth and seats beautifully. The barrel is a 1:10 Twist Rate with less than 150 rounds through it. I broke it in properly swabbing after every round for the first 20, then after every two for the next 20, then every 5 for the next 30. I have it in a KRG Chassis that is a fantastic modular stock. Several QD Swivel mounts on the chassis. It has an Atlas Bipod and precision dialing rear Monopod. A feather-weight trigger. CNC Aluminum Bolt Cap replaces the original plastic one. I have a 51T QD suppressor mounting Compensator from Advanced Armament Co. for a muzzle attachment. I also have a Surefire Muzzle Break included that I had previously mounted. The Optic is a crystal clear Sightron 8-32x56. I shoot out to 1000 yards with this setup. The 18in Barrel with a 1:10 Twist rate prefers 165-170gr ammo. I use 168gr unsuppressed. With a suppressor, I use 220gr Subsonic .308 which is whisper quiet. Between the Bolt Action, Full Length AAC 762-SD and Subsonic Ammo, this rifle is the quietest Firearm I have personally ever heard. If it sounds like I'm selling you, I'm not, I just really love this rifle. However, I am mobilizing soon and life happens. Please feel free to contact me with any questions."

Looking for $2700. Would consider partial plus cash or multiples for trade. Premier Heritage Tactical 3-15x50 plus cash would be at the top of my list. Will not separate unless the optic sells first. From the manufacturer's website: The 1.1-4x20 PM II ShortDot model is a combination of a red dot sight and a scope. It has been developed for the use at short and medium distances. With a low magnification the Short-Dot may be used like a red dot sight. The red target dot is mirrored in the center of the reticle. Turned off the illuminated dot vanishes completely leaving the user with a normal reticle. The illuminating unit offers 5 illumination stages for the use in broad daylight. The red dot remains visible, even on snow or sand or in bright sunlight. The use in poor lighting conditions provides for 3 illuminated stages, while another 3 three stages permit the use in combination with night-vision goggles. An automatic locking function is used to secure elevation and windage as well as the illuminating unit against any involuntary adjustment."

My intention was to make this my ""go-to"" hunting rifle. Gun shoots better than I will ever be. I replaced the standard open signts with a Skinner peep sight - and with his recommendation, I replaced the front sight too. Gun shoots great, but a bit too high for my liking. I still use my bolt action rifles, and the only time this gun has seen any shooting is at the range.I'll include the peep sights, the standard rail that was included, a Simmons 4x32 scope and the limbsaver recoil pad that is on there!This is a great deal for a deer rifle or a brush gun.
