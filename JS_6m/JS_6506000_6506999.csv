It has a forged upper receiver (DS30XXX) and a South African lower receiver (ZAXXX). The barrel is quite new and only has 300 rounds through it, and the rifle functions flawlessly. I already have several FALs, and I am selling this one in order to make room for another build. This rifle has really only been a safe queen and deserves a better home. It comes with one 20-round magazine, one blank firing adaptor, and one carry handle (I installed a spacer per my preference). I am asking $950, no trades please."

You can also order the optic from their website and have it shipped securely if you live out of state.The Trijicon 1-6x24 VCOG (Variable Combat Optical Gunsight) is a rugged variable powered riflescope that accommodates close quarter battle (CQB) and long distance marksmanship. It features superior glass quality and light gathering capabilities with zero distortion. The bullet drop compensating and ranging reticles allow for the shooter to quickly and accurately estimate range and apply the correct hold. The first focal plane reticle allows the subtensions and drops to remain true at any magnification. With a forged 7075-T6 aircraft-aluminum-alloy housing, the VCOG is an exceptionally durable and nearly indestructible sighting system. Robust enough for any application, the VCOG utilizes a single AA battery, commonly found across the globe and offers 6 adjustable brightness settings for the LED reticle. When powered by a lithium AA battery (like the one provided), it boasts a considerable battery life of 700 hours at setting 4 (constant on). An integrated dial fin allows easy rotation through the magnification range and a constant eye relief means no head or stock position adjustments are needed. Waterproof to 20 meters (66 ft.)."

I'd call it 99% condition, it's been to the range one time and had 140rds fired. Some light handling marks on the buttstock, and one small slightly shiny spot on the barrel, otherwise very beautiful.
This rifle is a no-nonsense 16"" barreled M4-style carbine. The lower is marked ""MODEL MOD4SA"" and ""CAL .223/5.56mm"" along with the usual manufacturer's markings. (I don't know where the name M4LE originally came from, but it was on the original cardboard box and listed on CMMG's website for years before they stopped making/listing these). The lower also has the usual A2-style pistol grip and M4-type 6-position stock. The upper receiver is the A4/Flattop variety, with forward assist, ejection port cover, and A2 charging handle, and with phosphated/milspec style full-auto bolt carrier group. The barrel is 16"" with A2 flashhider, front sight tower, carbine-length gas tube, and M4 oval handguards, 1-9"" twist with CMMG's WASP/Melonited finish. This gun is completely stock as it came from the factory, no modifications of any kind. No problems encountered whatsoever during it's one trip to the range. This would be a great AR for the first time owner or the experienced shooter. Unless you fire 500-1000rds per month, this gun will last for many years to come.
Also included in the asking price (Not pictured):
2x Magpul Gen 2 30rd PMags (used once during a range trip)
5x D&H Aluminum GI-style 30rd magazines, black teflon-coated, with Magpul Foliage Green followers, new in the saran wrap they shipped in. The floorplates are marked ""Palmetto State Armory.""
Magpul MBUS rear sight (new in wrapper)
200rds Federal American Eagle AE223  .223 Remington 55gr (unopened 20rd boxes)
Blackhawk! Tactical Sportster soft carrying case
Safariland Field Cleaning Kit (Unused) with CLP, brushes, rods, patch holder, patches, silicon gun cloth, and double-ended bristle brush.
 
My asking price is firm. This is not your neighbor's $450 Anderson Mfg AR-15. This a premium AR that retailed for between $800-$900 when they were readily available (before tax). The included extras would also add anywhere between $250-$325 worth of value.
Cash is king, but there are a few trades I would be willing to consider:
Walther P99 QA 9mm (Gen 2 preferred)+ $400 cash
Glock 17, 22 or 31 Gen 3 + $400 cash
Glock 17, 22, or 31 Gen 4 + $350 cash
Glock 34 Gen 3 + $300 cash
Glock 17 Gen 3 RTF2 + $350 cash
Please, don't offer to trade any of the above if they are heavily modified, hacked, dremeled, stippled, chrome-dipped, falling apart, worn out, or otherwise looking like they spent 30 years buried in a gravel pit. I only ever offer to sell/trade well cared for and respected firearms and admire those that do the same.
A further note about these trade offers: after the extra cash is factored in, these are what I would consider to be fair/reasonable offers for the various items listed, assuming they're in good/great condition. For example, I have seen great-looking preowned Gen 3 Glocks offered in stores for around $450. Unless your local gun shop is offering to sell your guns for free, these trade offers are (I feel) a better value than you would get if you tried to sell these on consignment.
 
If you'd like to see more pictures, please ask. If you have any questions, ask. If you like this rifle and want to meet up to buy/trade, please text for fastest response: 817-THREE-SEVEN-ONE-THREE-NINE-TWO-EIGHT

A cerakote is perfect for this gun because Kimber 1911's are known for not having very excellent factory finishes.
