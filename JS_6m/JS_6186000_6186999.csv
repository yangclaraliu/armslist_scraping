It has a Magpul MOE handguard (Sorry to say it is self-modified) and a Magpul Zhukov stock with both (Magpul) 1/4"" Olive drab cheek riser and a 1/2"" black cheek riser. It will include two Echo93 attachments: Single-point Sling mount and Sling, and Magpul ""Fakelite"" grip. Although I have quite a few magazines, many of them are rare, but I will include 1-Polish-made Steel Milsurp magazine, and 2 Tapco magazines, along with approximately 290 rounds of Yugo brass-cased ammunition (corrosive, so take precaution). I will include some of the original furniture as well, including a self-refurbished Romanian wooden Handguard with Grip. It does not have original wood gas tube cover due to an installation problem which caused it to break. Rifle has worked extremely well and has been expertly taken care of by myself. It will need a firing pin replacement in approxmately 2,000 rounds, but everything else is functioning amazingly for a WASR.PRICE IS NEGOTIABLEThis will help pay for expenses for my Study abroad.

This gun has never been fired. This weapon features ALL original parts and does not have the “safety problem” – it has the safety button, not the “lever”. It has been twice inspected by gunsmiths and is in completely functional order. The gun has been displayed and handled over the years so it does have a couple of tiny nicks and a rub on the end of the magazine tube, but is otherwise in perfect shape. The gun has the full magazine tube so will hold 9 shots. Just to remind you, this is a 12 guage (2-3/4”) semi-automatic and manual (pump) shotgun. The barrel is 21 ½” long and the gun will hold 8 shells plus one in the chamber. The original finish is parkerized with the receiver and barrel being black, and the ventilated forearm area being the factor grey-dark olive. Will ship for free & you will recieve within 2-9days once payment as been confirmed"

These things are not your everyday billet lower. They are the Ferrari of billet lowers and include a bunch of stuff that you normally would pay extra for.REDACTED texting is bestOpen to tradesNo shippingCash in handBuyer pays all feesWilling to travel within reason distanceI have a FFL in Azusa that has no lines and quick May have a FFL in Simi Valley as wellIf the ad is up, the pistol is still availableNot a fire sale.  I'm more than happy to keep it if it doesn't sell.  I'm just thinning the heard, so lowballers save your breath.
 
This is straight from Spikes website
 The Gen II billet lower receiver comes with the following components already installed to make your life easier:
 Titanium pivot pin, detent, and spring
Titanium take down pin, detent, spring, and 4-40 set screw
KNS Gen 2 Mod ST anti-rotation trigger and hammer pins
Spike's Tactical 90* ambi safety selector
Enhanced bolt catch
Ambi bolt release paddle
Bolt catch spring
Bolt catch plunger
Ambi bolt release cross pin
Threaded stainless steel pin for bolt catch
Threaded stainless steel pin for ambi bolt release paddle
Ambi magazine release paddle
Magazine catch
Magazine catch spring
Billet magazine catch button
Set screw for adjustable trigger reset
Nylon tip set screw for upper to lower tension
2 short set screws to lock adjustable trigger reset set screw and upper to lower tension set screw in place
 

 
 
While our billet upper receiver and billet lower receiver are a perfect match with each other, they will also work with forged upper receivers and forged lower receivers.
The billet upper and lower receivers also maintain compatibility with most Mil-Spec components. So in the event you break or loose a component in the field you don't have to worry about finding any proprietary parts to get it back up and running again. Yes we did think of everything."

The attached device is a Kak shockwave brace designed to help the user effectively and more consistently shoot the firearm with one hand, not to be used to shoulder the weapon.Aero Precision upper receiver with a 10"" barrel with 1:8 rifling. The firearm has a pistol length gas system with a .750 Odin Works low profile gas block. It has a mill-spec MPI/HBT bcg with 9310 black nitride coating for improved functioning with little to no lubrication. The black nitride also improves the overall appearance of the bcg really looks good in the rifle when all cleaned up with CLP. The handguard is 12.5"" YHM diamond series quad rail with flip-up iron sights. The muzzle device is 5/8-24 Kak flash can designed to push muzzle gases forward away from the shooter and those on the sides.Anderson manufacturing lower receiver with PSA lower parts and some minor component changes. Pistol has Battle Arms Development improved mag release as well as an ALG QMS mill spec trigger for an improved trigger feel. The buffer tube is made by Kak and is the best pistol buffer tube I have seen yet and attached is a Kak Shockwave brace. The pistol will also come with 3, 30 round magazines. A lot of time and effort went into picking out the components for this build but unfortunately some unforeseen situations have come up and I need to sell before the holidays. Must be legally able to own a pistol and a resident of the state of Ohio, CCW holder preferred. Firearm has only seen 20 rounds to sight in and test function. I used 4 separates mags to test function with 4 different grain ammo.

The 226 is in immaculate condition. No scratches WHATSOEVER! Looking at the internals, one may question whether the pistol had been fired at all. The 226 has been upgraded with the Factory SRT and also the factory TacOps Magwell grips seen on some of the Tacops series pistols from SIG. It also comes with its standard 2 15-round mags and new Hogue G10 smooth hardcoat anodized grips, and a concealed right-hand Kydex carbon fiber Holster. In addition i am throwing in a 50 round box of 9mm NATO rounds. They are made to military standards so i would NOT recommend using them in a really cheap pistol that can't handle higher pressures. One additional feature is that the slide has Custom Professional engavings on it (MOLON LABE) normally found on the Spartan series pistols from SIG. This is a SUPER SWEET one-of-a-kind pistol. You will never find another one like it. The 229 is the Elite Dark .40 It shows normal wear but no damage as it has never been mishandled. 12-round capacity with Adjustable sig Night sights and the Factory Short Reset Trigger. This pistol shoots amazing and is a great vehicle pistol and doubles as a concealable, too. It's coming with 30 rounds of Magtech FMJ 180gr. and 17 rounds of Winchester .40 180gr JHP.My asking price for the P226 is $950. Price for the P229 is $800If you want BOTH, the price is $1,600 FIRM! THAT'S A GREAT PRICE FOLKS! DO NOT PASS THIS UP!!!Let me know if you have any questions, message me ANY time night or day. REDACTED If you are not interested in the pistol, please don't message me"
