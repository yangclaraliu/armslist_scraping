I was able to put a full cylinder through the bullseye perfectly at 15 feet, but I don't need another revolver.This model is the ""-2"" variant, and is almost indistinguishable from new. There are no marks or scratches except for one tiny scratch on the bottom of the butt of the gun. Lock up is tight like new. It clearly has not been fired very much. Personally we only put 15 rounds through it.For those of you who don't know, this model was made before S&W started putting their locks and transfer bars in these guns.  This means you cannot find a trigger this good or this reliable these days. It really is something else to try this trigger, both in single or double action.Here is a link ( http://imgur.com/a/7AVLi ) to an album with many detailed pictures showing that the gun has no pitting, scratches, or holster wear save for the one on the bottom.The gun comes with a genuine (non original) S&W blue plastic box.Text is best: REDACTED"

This one belongs to my best friend, and I'm selling it for him because he needs a bit of cash and has another Glock. I actually owned this one for a while, and can attest that it shoots very well and has been 100% reliable. Also, when it was with me, I installed a brand new set of Tru Dot night sights which are now about three months old. They are dead-nuts on for zero, and as an old Glock man and armorer, I can tell you that this pistol is good to go as-is, and if you don't screw with it adding all sorts of things you don't need, it will serve you well. The older Glock 26 may not be as slim as the newer Glock 43 single stack, but it holds a lot more rounds, can take much longer magazines, and is much easier to shoot. I've shot this one out to 50 yards with great success. Believe me, it's worth the extra 1/4 inch of thickness.
The gun will come with a total of three (3) magazines, one of which has a pinky extension on it. Only two are shown in the pictures because I did not have the third when photos were taken, but you WILL get three, and that third one is brand new. There will also be included a nice custom inside the waistband leather holster from Backwoods Custom Leather, which is a very well-made heavy duty carry holster used by professionals. Sorry, there is no box.You can see and purchase the pistol at my office in Homestead. Must be willing to give a copy of your driver's license and sign a bill of sale. All laws complied with. Thanks for looking at my buddy's pistol. No trades on this one, he needs cash for a motorcycle repair."
