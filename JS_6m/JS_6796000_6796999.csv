I bought a beautiful leather chest holster - also custom made by a real Alaska craftsman.  Wearing it this way took all the weight & was comfortable all day.  Only upholstered this gun once & faced off at 30' with a Brown once.  Thankfully he barked , huffed & walked away.  So I didn't have to test it. Lol. The gun has trigger work by a great gunsmith. ( smoothed action ) & is a dream to fire with 44 regular loads.  In 44 magnum, my girlfriend can handle it also.  The Monogrip by Hogue provides recoil softening as well as a solid purchase.  Shoots like a dream. Several boxes of both magnum and 44 special shells go with it.  Would make a great hunting pistol.  Barrel is 5.5"".  Rear sight adjustable i have $1,100+ in this package.  $800 gun, $175 holster , $125 trigger work, plus the grips.  Willing to listen to offers, but will not give it away.  Might trade for a high end commander 1911 in 45acp , or an M&P CORE w red dot & extras.  AR15, M&P Shield in 45acp, or ?, can add $ for special deal.

Nearly identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound less due to its forged aluminum frame, making it more comfortable for everyday carry. Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no manual safety lever, the relatively longer and heavier first round trigger pull requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. There is a safety stop on the hammer as well as a firing pin block safety. It has snag-free, fixed 3-dot sights. Other features of the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps, and a loaded chamber indicator.

I only shot a couple hundred rounds when I first got it and have barely shot it since I put it away so I would have to put the round count somewhere around 500 or less. It's a great gun especially for a longer range AR or a varmint rifle but like I said I just don't use it anymore. That being said I'm interested in trades for smaller AR's/AK's, hunting rifles, handguns, shotguns etc. just let me know what you've got. Mainly just looking for handguns (like a Glock 20), a smaller AR, or I'm also wanting to jump on the 6.5 Creedmoor bandwagon if you've got anything in that category. Last but not least money talks also so let me know what you've got. Feel free to call and leave a message if I don't answer but text works best and will be the fastest response. REDACTED Also have pictures upon request for some reason I couldn't upload them."
