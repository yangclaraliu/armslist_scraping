Just last weekend I shot under 1/2 MOA groups with this rifle, and have fired about 200 rounds without any issues. Note that I am not including the scope in the deal for the listed price, unless somebody wants it. Its a vortex 4-16 FFP scope worth $700-800 so Its not included at the price of $1400 However, Alot of other extras are included.

Will include reloading dies as well.  Also has a bipod, and will include a barrel wrench and headspacing kit if You ever want to change out the barrel on it. Barrel should be good for another 1000-1500 rounds or so. NJ Buyers prefered, must have Matching NJ DL and Firearms ID. Out of state buyers within a reasonable distance must be willing to meet at an FFl to do the transfer. Sorry no shipping, too many scammers on this site to risk it.

Note that the included pictures are a little old, so not everything included in the sale is in the pictures. I have $3400 into this rifle all together, so the total with the scope of $2000 is relatively fair."

Peter Chen  ww2dbaseThe ""Samozaryadnaya Vintovka Tokareva, Obrazets 1940 goda"" (Tokarev Self-loading Rifle, Model 1940), or Tokarev SVT-40 for short, was a semi-automatic rifle design that developed from the SVT-38 semi-automatic rifles. Experience from the Winter War with Finland concluded that the SVT-38 rifles were too long and cumbersome, and they were too complex to maintain in combat conditions; some soldiers even complained that ammunition magazines would fall off at times. Production of the SVT-38 design halted in 1940 after about 160,000 were built.In Jul 1940, the SVT-40 design entered production at Tula, Russia in attempt to address SVT-38 weapons' issues. The production was later expanded to the Ishevsk Arsenal and the Kovrov Arsenal. The SVT-40 semi-automatic rifles were lighter, the ammunition magazines were modified, and the overall construction was simplified slightly to streamline production. By the end of 1940, 70,000 of them were available, and in 1941, over one million examples were built. Although they were effective weapons, the older Mosin-Nagant rifles were easier to use and the PPSh-41 submachine guns were cheaper to manufacture, thus SVT-40 semi-automatic rifles slowly fell out of Russian favor. In 1942, production of these semi-automatic rifles ceased at the Ishevsk Arsenal, and overall production dropped to only 264,000 in 1942. The production ceased altogether in Jan 1945; about 1.5 million SVT-40 semi-automatic rifles were built between 1940 and 1945. A small number of them were built as fully-automatic weapons and they were designated AVT-40, while some others were meant to be used as sniper rifles; both of these variant designs were disappointing.During WW2, Finnish and German forces also used SVT-40 semi-automatic rifles on a smaller scale, all from captured examples. Finland captured 4,000 SVT-38 weapons during the Winter War and over 15,000 SVT-40 weapons during the Continuation War, while the German Army operated hundreds of thousands of captured SVT-40 semi-automatic weapons under the designation of SIG.259(r). German use of the weapon was so significant that the Germany Army actually published an operating manual for them.The Russian Army generally stopped using SVT-40 semi-automatic rifles as soon as SKS and AK-47 designs came into production, and by 1955 they were all retired from service; the majority of Russian-operated SVT-40 semi-automatic rifles were placed in storage until the 1990s. The Finnish Army retired its last SVT-40 weapon in 1958, selling 7,500 of them into the civilian market largely in the United States."

I have for sale or trade a NEW IN THE BOX Ruger AR556 Rifle. This rifle is roughly 3 months old. Purchased it, has not been fired. Have opened the Magpul magazine but nothing has been cycled through it - it's just been in the box under my bed.  It's in 10/10 condition, have all associated paperwork. Included is 1 brand new Ruger ar556 rifle chambered in .223 / 5.56, 1 magpul 30rd capacity magazine, front sight adjustment tool, ruger pop-up rear site (pretty much a magpul but without the larger apeture only a small apeture), cable lock, chamber flag, and all associated paperwork. 
also going to throw in a cheapo red dot that I have - will need a riser to use though to get over front sight. Will also include 60 rounds of Wolf brand .223 steel case ammo.

Has normal rubbing along metal where the pump slides. This model has the reliable crossbolt safety, not the dangerous lever safety. Switch between pump and auto. Fixed stock. Includes owners manual, spare parts booklet, magazine plug, and original box."

I am selling my Rock River Operator II. This LAR-15 rifle features a chrome bolt carrier, 16 inch chrome moly 1:9 twist barrel- chambered in .556 NATO which allows .556 or .223 rounds to be fired from it. The rifle also features a CAR stock, forged A4 upper, half quad- free floating mid-length hand guard as well as a Hogue pistol grip. I have installed a low profile gas block that eliminated the front sight bulk; I will include the original gas block if desired that has the front flip up sight. The rifle originally came with one mag, but I will include 2. I will also include a SOG bungee single point sling with the required end clip to attach the sling to the rifle.  I will be removing the Magpul Bad lever, unless the buyer wants it, it’s just an additional $30.  I am the original owner of this rifle and have put less than 100 rounds through it. I attempted to sight the rifle in on the optic I bought for it unsuccessfully , and have decided to go a different direction and just sell it. I am asking $950 FIRM. I am not looking for trades.

Model: Top Lever Hammer Caliber: 12 gauge New / Used: UsedCondition: This top lever hammer shotgun is a Grade 2 (G) and appears to all be original. Serial number research indicates a build year of 1887. The barrels are fine three-grade Damascus steel, 30” length, and measure to be choked Improved Cylinder. They ring true and have a light amount of bluing left on the patina finish. There are two light dings in the barrels within 8” of the muzzle. The bores show light to moderate pitting.The receiver, hammers, and dogleg top lever still have strong engraving. The side plates have light case color visible. The stock and forend are solid without cracks; original checkering is worn smooth but quite visible. There is a ½” long repaired area in the butt plate of some type of filler material. The wood does have small nicks and dings one would expect of a gun of this ilk, but nothing significant. The action locks up very tight without any hint of wiggle or loose fit. This is superb example of an honest side-by-side shotgun with character. We have additional higher resolution pictures of this item available upon request.

FIRED LESS THAN 10 TIMESThe Colt Python was first introduced in 1955 as Colt's top-of-the-line model and was originally intended to be a large-frame 38 Special target revolver. As a result, it features precision adjustable sights, a smooth trigger, solid construction, and extra metal. Pythons have a distinct appearance due to a full barrel underlug, ventilated rib and adjustable sights. Originally, Colt manufactured Pythons with hollow underlugs but left them solid to work as a stabilizing barrel weight. When the revolver is at full cock, just as the trigger is pressed, the cylinder locks up for the duration of the hammer strike. Other revolvers have a hint of looseness even at full-cock. The gap between the cylinder and forcing cone is very tight, further aiding accuracy and velocity. Each Python revolver was boresighted at the factory with a laser and was the first mass-produced revolver to do so. In October 1999, Colt Manufacturing Co. announced the termination of its production of Python revolvers. In a 2000 follow-up letter to distributors, the company cited changing market conditions and the costs of defending lawsuits, as the reasons for the discontinuation of the Python line as well as a number of other models.I CAN SHIP, CONTACT ME FOR SHIPPING ARRANGEMENTS.."

FIRED LESS THAN 10 TIMESThe Colt Python was first introduced in 1955 as Colt's top-of-the-line model and was originally intended to be a large-frame 38 Special target revolver. As a result, it features precision adjustable sights, a smooth trigger, solid construction, and extra metal. Pythons have a distinct appearance due to a full barrel underlug, ventilated rib and adjustable sights. Originally, Colt manufactured Pythons with hollow underlugs but left them solid to work as a stabilizing barrel weight. When the revolver is at full cock, just as the trigger is pressed, the cylinder locks up for the duration of the hammer strike. Other revolvers have a hint of looseness even at full-cock. The gap between the cylinder and forcing cone is very tight, further aiding accuracy and velocity. Each Python revolver was boresighted at the factory with a laser and was the first mass-produced revolver to do so. In October 1999, Colt Manufacturing Co. announced the termination of its production of Python revolvers. In a 2000 follow-up letter to distributors, the company cited changing market conditions and the costs of defending lawsuits, as the reasons for the discontinuation of the Python line as well as a number of other models.I CAN SHIP, CONTACT ME FOR SHIPPING ARRANGEMENTS.."

This has 4 keys to create a code for electronic access as well as keyed access for backup. This is perfect for beside the bed, by the door or anyone who wants to secure a handgun around the house but have the ability to access it in seconds if needed. It will fit most handguns, I was able to fit a glock 21 with one extra magazine when I tested it, with a magazine it is a bit tight but with just a pistol it is perfect. I am open to trades for ar15 parts (barrels, stocks, buffer tubes, etc.), 45 and 556 ammo, and am willing to hear other offers. Worst I can do is say no. These retail for $150-200.
