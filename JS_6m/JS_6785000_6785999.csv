No FFL required to sell or ship. I have all equipment necessary to complete with your supplied lower if you wish. Changed my mind on this build and I am moving soon so time to let it go. This thing shoots great and was consistently shooting 2"" or smaller groups @ 100yds with a cheap scope @ 3x power off a front sand bag on a cheap plastic table. That was while working up a hunting load using Barnes 110 tac tx bullets. Groups were consistent through the ladder test and I was getting right around 2150fps. All of the above is pretty damn good for this type of setup(I know I know, you shoot 1/4"" groups @ 100yds off hand with a 44mag with iron sights!!) This would make a great blacktail deer rig(my intended purpose) or a great defense/fun shooting AR. I wouldn't hesitate on deer out to 200yds and most blacktail are taken inside 100yds. I bought a custom leupold vxr 1.25-4x with CDS option scope for it but never mounted. I can include that for another $350 ($600 scope). That would make a great compact and light weight hunting setup. Carry it with a bungee sling on your chest hands free all day and not even know it's there, but it's ready in less then a second.

It is constructed with a modular rail system that allows for the easy mounting of ancillary devices, fires from a closed bolt, has a collapsible buttstock, and is easily field-stripped without the need for any special tools. The straight-line construction, coupled with the low recoil of 9mm ammunition, provides highly accurate fire with less muzzle climb, especially in full automatic fire. Less recoil also facilitates ease of training and improves accuracy. The effective range of the Colt AR6951 is 100 meters.

He charged $1600 for the conversion on your rifle. He no longer offers the GSR so this is a pretty rare firearm. It was touted as one of the best SHTF rifles by the guys at Snipers Hide forum. This was finished in KG Gunkote by Jim Fuller and you can almost count the number of shots it has fired by the marks that the cases left on the charging handle. Its round count since new is 60 rounds. It has not fired any corrosive ammo and shows zero bore erosion. You are welcome to bring a throat erosion guage and check it.PSL rifle values are skyrockting and I have seen plain rifles selling for $3000 on gunbroker. This is also listed on gunbroker and will be unavailable for purchase locally when it gets a bid on it. The Armslist local cash price is for the rifle and 1 magazine. The gunbroker auction is slightly higher priced but will include multiple magazines. Made by Fabrica de Arme Cugir SA, ignore the manufacturer below, armslist does not have a complete list.Sling included, scope not included but color matched Texas Weapons System top cover/rail mount is included.As you can tell from the pictures this is a long way from a stock PSL. It has the TWS optics mount, and custom made aluminum forend, magpul stock and a folding mechanism which makes it very portable and comfortable to tote around on your back in a pack or just slung. No trades, cash only on this one and the price is firm. I will sell it for $2500 locally so i dont have to mess with shipping it. It will be priced higher on Gunbroker. Must meet in OzarkThanksJesus christ with you fake cashiers check scammers. I WILL NOT ship this gun without having cash or a USPS money order."

Rare Pre-model 43 Airweight kit gun, also known as “Model of 1955”. This gun for sale was manufactured circa 1955 and was part of S&W’s “pilot production” early run of this model which actually began in 1954. This gun for sale has a relatively early-run serial number of 15xxx and S&W didn’t begin mass production of this model until serial numbers beginning around 32xxx in 1958. The Model of 1955 is similar to S&W’s Model of 1953 (i.e., a small rimfire revolver with a coiled mainspring and micro-click rear sights) with the exception of the fact that the Model of 1955 is made with an alloy frame hence the Airweight name reference (Note no model name or Airweight reference is printed on gun, only its serial number). Box label includes the Airweight designation. Gun for sale is 100% factory original and is in excellent, virtually mint condition with its original factory box and includes originally factory furnished tools including bore cleaner and screw driver. No issues with metallic finish on frame/cylinder and case colored components or wooden grips, bore, sights, etc. A very slight turn line on cylinder exists but is just about invisible when a light coat of oil is applied. Line doesn’t appear to permeate the bluing and is very faint - indicative of the fact that this gun has seen very little field/target use. Screws on this gun are in excellent condition. Rear sight adjustment screw shows evidence that sight has been adjusted hence it is in perfect condition, the Gun for sale is priced just below its fair market value... Why not shoot a nice gun.Thanks for stopping by."

I bought this rifle a couple of years back, fired no more than 300 rounds, and put it in the safe.  I've had no problems with it.  It has the original mag that came with the rifle plus 4 other surplus mags.This is a really great gun with features you won't find on any AK.  It's striker fired, has milled receiver, the bolt holds back on the last round (and uses stripper clips) plus the milled rifle is lighter than most stamped AKs.Must have PTP/PTC and MN DL.
Thanks"

The Finns replaced the old 30. caliber cartridge with the more popular 9mm para by replacing the barrel with a Tikkakoski Finnish barrel which this one has a proof mark on the top of the barrel. Also this Luger has a 3 5/8 inch barrel not a 4 inch because of the Versailles Peace Treaty conditions which makes it pre WWII.  It is a military pistol as it has the 4 not 5 (which is a commerical) serial number with a letter L under it. It also has the Finnish SA next to barrel with a crown over N on the left side next to barrel wihich means its nitro proofed. And is it commerical? If you look at the history, the Finns did a commerical contract with the Imperial German Military by DWM but used them in the military. Because of the stock lug and the research I date this pistol anywhere from 1913 to 1918. Has the black grips but also comes with the wodden grips.     If you have any questions please text me at REDACTED. I do no FFL"
