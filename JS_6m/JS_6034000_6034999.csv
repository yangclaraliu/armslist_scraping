Folding brace and nice trigger/parts to fit a Sig P556.
Springfield M1A SOCOM 16 or Scout 18"".
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus, AR15 and AR10's, AK type with 10"" barrel and folding brace, Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" model only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal, depending on value.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles.  Value needs to equal cash price, let me know the details.
