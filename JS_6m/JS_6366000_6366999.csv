Fun gun, just haven't had time to have an emotional attachment to it, and I need the cash.***NOTE*** You will not find a six shot Pitbull anymore, these have been discontinued! The 5 inch barrel is uncommon, and I'm not trying to hype this up as a super rare gun, but I can't find any others for sale on Gunbroker or on online gun shops.The 9mm Rimless Pittbull uses same unique rimless cartridge extractor assembly system as the Charter Arms .40 cal Rimless Revolver. A dual coil spring assembly located in the extractor allows insertion and retention of a 9mm cartridge in each chamber of the revolver's cylinder. After firing, the shooter can easily eject the spent cartridges for immediate reloading. Charter Arms has taken the difficulty of rimless loading and ejection to the simplicity of the rimmed cartridge in the revolver industry.UPC: 678958799507Vendor Part No: CA 79950I also have a spare set of grips for it from either Hogue or some other very popular brand. It fills the hand better, and since this is a 5"" barreled revolver, I doubt you'll be CCW'ing it.I still have the case, manual, lock, and everything else that came with it from the store. I have a light action mainspring, but I had two weak primer strikes with it, and immediately put back the original mainspring. Double action pull is about nine pounds, and single is buttery smooth and crisp, like a piece of toast at less than three pounds!Bring a driver's license with you at sale."

It's not exact but pretty close. The rifle does not come with the suppressor. Suppressor is not for sale! Rifle will come with a standard A2 flash hider installed. If the price scares you, then you probably don't know much about these rifles or the components on it. The scope alone was $1500. I would be willing to sell the upper separately with or without the scope. I won't sell the scope before anything else. The tan coloring is spary paint and can be removed. If you prefer an all black rifle I will remove all the paint for you. You'll never be able to tell it was sprayed. I thought it looked good. Thanks for looking!zachtext or call41four-79five-484zero"

This firearm is based on the original Rex Zero 1s, but manufactured to be dimensionally comparable to the Glock 19. This version comes with their factory anodized Flat Dark Earth finish, and ships new-in-box with (2) 15 round magazines, padded hard case, owner’s manual, and gun lock. The Rex Zero is one of the highest quality pistols and best values in today’s handgun market. The Rex is an all metal, hammer fired pistol that has passed extensive Slovenian Military/NATO based tests, and has a lifetime warranty. The Rex allows the user to operate the gun in their choice of modes; either DA/SA or SAO. AREX is an ISO90001 certified company. Their expertise shows in the exceptional fit and finish of this gun. The frame is T7075-T6 aluminum with full-length slide rails, dust cover picatinny rail, ambi-safeties, and ambi-magazine releases. The slide is cut from solid bar stock, coated to protect against wear and corrosion, and has forward cocking serrations. The steel sights can be replaced with any after-market dovetail sights. AREX makes their own magazines, and they are of superb quality. They contain a unique progressive rate spring, are easy to disassemble for cleaning, are coated inside and out for corrosion resistance, and the spring is attached to the follower (can be removed). This firearm can be operated either “cocked & locked” or safely de-cocked for DA/SA operation. The external safety operates in either configuration. The Rex has a 1 piece cold hammer forged barrel made from solid bar stock and is nitrocarburized. A loaded chamber indicator comes standard. Lastly, the Rex is approved for all commercial SAAMI specification +P ammunition. The Rex Zero complies with strict military standards for reliability and has passed extreme temperature, hostile environment, and drop tests. The expected service life for the pistol exceeds 30,000 rounds. Please let us know if you have any additional questions, and don’t forget to check out our other listings!

The tubular folding stocks on these rifles come equipped with a spring loaded cheek riser, and lock firm in the closed position when folded. These rifles are built at the Molot Oruzhie Factory in Molot Russia, and are newly imported to the United States Market. These are chambered in the versatile and hard-hitting 7.62x39. These rifles are built using 1.5mm RPK Receivers, making them 50% more reinforced than traditional stamped AK Rifles. Additionally, these rifles are built using heavy RPK-Style Chrome-Lined Hammer Forged Barrels, making them exceptionally rigid and extremely accurate. The barrels are threaded in the traditional 14x1mm left hand pattern. Also, these rifles come with a factory installed mil-spec side rail for mounting optics (these would make excellent AK-Pattern Designated Marksman Rifles!). These rifles have Black Polymer RPK Furniture, and a Warsaw-Length Buttstock with trap door containing a cleaning kit and cleaning rod. These rifles will also accept any standard mil-spec double stack AK Magazine. These will make great down-range investments given the future uncertainty on Russian Imports. They are very high quality, well-built rifles, and are made to last for generations. Please contact us with any questions. Note: This rifle ships from the factory with (1) 5 round magazine (we do have additional new/never-issued steel surplus 30 round magazines with bolt hold open followers available for purchase for $16 each). We accept almost all forms of payment (2% fee for card over the phone). *Don't forget to check out our other listing!"

These rifles are built using 1.5mm RPK Receivers, making them 50% more reinforced than traditional stamped AK Rifles.

The barrels are threaded in the traditional 14x1mm left hand pattern. These rifles also come with a factory installed mil-spec side rail for mounting optics and would make excellent AK-Type Designated Marksman Rifles. They ship with Black Polymer RPK Furniture, and a Warsaw-Length Buttstock with trap door containing a cleaning kit and cleaning rod. These rifles will accept any standard mil-spec double stack AK Magazine.

These are chambered in the versatile and hard-hitting 7.62x39. These rifles are built using 1.5mm RPK Receivers, making them 50% more reinforced than traditional stamped AK Rifles. Additionally, these rifles are built using heavy RPK-Style Chrome-Lined Hammer Forged Barrels, making them exceptionally rigid and extremely accurate. The barrels are threaded in the traditional 14x1mm left hand pattern. Also, these rifles come with a factory installed mil-spec side rail for mounting optics (these would make excellent AK-Pattern Designated Marksman Rifles!). These rifles have Black Polymer RPK Furniture, and a Warsaw-Length Buttstock with trap door containing a cleaning kit and cleaning rod. These rifles will also accept any standard mil-spec double stack AK Magazine. These will make great down-range investments given the future uncertainty of Russian Imports. They are very high quality, well-built rifles, and are made to last for generations. Please contact us with any questions. Note: This rifle ships from the factory with (1) 5 round magazine and (1) New/Un-Issued 30 Round Steel Surplus Magazine w/ Bolt Hold Open Follower."

No trades.. Upgraded to CMC trigger.The new M6 Individual Carbine family is the direct descendant of the rifles developed by LWRCI™ to meet the requirements of the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program. It includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years.All members of the IC family feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.The Monoforge™ upper receiver used in all members of the IC family is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced by LWRCI™ in 2011. It features a user-configurable rail system. Moreover, the mounting base for the handguard is machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight.The new Individual Carbine family from LWRCI shows that, at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward.Specifications:- Caliber: 5.56 NATO- Barrel Length: 16.1""- Weight (unloaded): 7.3 lbs- Length (overall): 32"" - 35.25""- Rate of Fire: Semi Automatic- Rifling: 1/7"" RH - Stock/Pistol Grip: LWRCI/Magpul MOE- Sights: LWRCI Folding BUIS Front and Rear- Magazine: 30 Round - Muzzle Device: A2 Birdcage 1/2x28 TPI"

Estimate on rounds fired 250 - 300DANIEL DEFENSE V11™ LWThe Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11 Lightweight, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular). KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4V11 LW is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Lightweight profile barrel, making it almost 5 ounces lighter than the standard V11. This rifle also includes the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTIONLOWER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.
