The barrel pin was properly drilled and reamed out with no egging and all other parts were drilled and reamed to the proper dimesions and then pinned. The gun is then ultrasonically cleaned and then fresh cerakote is applied. These are aweseome guns in a great caliber, the 5.45 is the russian version of out .223 but the ammo is cheaper and the round causes more damage, Its great for hog hunting. This gun is freshly built and . I am willing to trade but prefer cash. I will ship this item to your ffl if you pay the shipping or can meet you locally around houston."
