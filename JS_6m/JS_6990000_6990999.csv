This pistol hasn't even seen 1,000 rounds and has been meticulously cleaned after ever trip to the range.  This gun is a safe queen and is in amazing condition. You will think it just came out of the box.  I have never had a single malfunction with this firearm. Anyone who has ever shot a P220 know that they are super reliable, eat any ammo with no hiccup and are probably the most reliable 45 you can get. The exchange will be done through a FFL and the buyer pays the transfer fee. The price is $850 If you have any questions, feel free to ask.Thank you."

The story I got when purchased was these were West German Olympic Games guns, seemed to make sense as who would have 3. I had not tried to do the research , didn't care at the time. I believe the gun was produced in the 50's. I'm not an Olympic class shooter, but believe with this gun I could be. Early front & rear sights, low serial#s on gun & conversion & all matching. The 22LR Conversion Unit has its own serial number range, considering it's age. Barrel and Slide numbered together.The 9mm gun, frame, barrel, slide, and trigger pack are numbered the same. I believe the 22LR Conversion Unit and the gun are selected for their inherent accuracy. The red paint on the rear sight blade, I've seen before on other guns, I thought about trying to remove & decided against, remnants on 22 conversion as well. No import marks.

I'll let it go with the trade for $100.00.The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. On this model both magazines hold 10 rounds and feature a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers. The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.
