As you can see, the rifle is in excellent condition. I had the bolt handle professionally forged and polished for scope usage by Fincer's- a Gunsmith that specializes in bolt work in Texas. That was a $75 service and well worth it. I also invested in the historically correct reproduction sling which cost $50. This sling was custom made by Welser Militaria In AMERICA and is not to be confused with those that come from China. This sling has new old stock original equipment hardware which is much better in quality than the Chinese made slings out there for $20. This sling has an authentic NOS quick disconnect rear swivel so that you can mount it either to the buttstock or the ""parade"" mount at the trigger guard. The Steyr Mauser is one of the finest Mausers made in terms of quality, fit and finish.This is a re-arsenaled rifle that was, from my understanding, done sometime in the 1950s and at that time they rebarreled the rifle with a modern 7.62x51 NATO chambered barrel. It is one of the finest examples I have seen of these special Mausers. It definitely has not seen much use since the re-arsenal and the barrel is in near new condition with strong and shiny rifling. Because it is chambered in the all-around and plentiful 7.62 NATO/ .308 round, it is the perfect ""shooter"" Mauser. I have this listed at a flat out bargain considering the condition, the rarity, the newly forged and polished bolt, the Austrian Steyr quality and the new historically correct sling. This a rare rifle, not a ""moonrock"" as Larry Vickers would say, but definately hard to get your hands on. I have it priced to move quickly to the astute buyer. For better and many more prictures I have this simultaneously listed on Gunbroker:  http://www.gunbroker.com/item/618114351  I am not interested in any trades and my price is absolutely firm."

Regular price is $159.00, and a bargain at that. Still covered by the factory warranty.  Photos are of the actual revolver and the pics show the minor indent in one of the grips.  Born of the Traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the Legendary Single Action Army Revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22 LR the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art-precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded, and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic laminated, or white grips, makes this Rough Rider both functional and handsome. Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting. Let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver. PROUDLY MADE IN OUR USA. All Heritage revolvers combine quality and affordability ... an American tradition. This has consistantly been one of the top selling handguns in the United States for the last 2 decades. They look great, they work great and they are at a great price. This is the perfect glove box or field carry revolver and just tons of fun to shoot.   It's affordable to own and inexpensive to shoot. What are you waiting for.....   Free layaway option available.I sell new firearms with full manufacter's warranties for less then many dealers are asking for used guns. The name of the game is inventory turnover. I am not looking for customers stupid enough to pay a sucker's price. Check everyone else's price, and then if you are serious about buying, give me a call. I have the lowest prices in the Greater Tampa Bay Area. You might find lower, but only if you are willing to travel to PullmyChain, North Dakota. I even beat most of the National Internet dealers, and will save you the cost of paying shipping and a transfer fee (assumes you are a local buyer)."
