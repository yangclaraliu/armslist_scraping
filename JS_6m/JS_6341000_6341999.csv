Uncle Sam’s original spec sheet was a one-size fits all. But the 1911-loving public quickly figured out that America’s favorite autoloader could be improved with customization. The Loaded Series from Springfield Armory® brings you the culmination of those lessons. These pistols are Loaded with all the features a 1911 should have. Whether you’re looking for a pistol to use for target practice or home defense, you’ll appreciate the extended ambidextrous thumb safety found on all Loaded 1911s. Likewise, the ergonomic beavertail grip safety, lightweight delta hammer and extended trigger enhance handling and performance in any situation. But not every feature does all jobs, and so the Loaded Series is a diverse lineup. The variety of finishes, frames, calibers and sights means that there is a Loaded 1911 designed to handle your intended application. If you’re ready for a 1911 that brings you upgraded features without a custom shop price tag, look into the Loaded Series. Springfield 1911 MC Operator Loaded PX9105MLP  Specs   Caliber .45ACP Recoil System GI Style Sights Low Profile Combat, 3 - Dot Tritium Weight (with Empty Magazine) 43 ozs.

The generous, parallax-free, sight picture and forgiving eyebox gets shooters on target effortlessly—even in high-stress scenarios. Rear facing power and illumination intensity controls are easy to access, simple to operate, stay visually present from the shooting position and are protected from incidental contact. Ten intensity levels let you adjust to perfectly match ambient light conditions. Runs off a single, common, AAA battery. The DRT (Dual Ring Tactical) reticle is etched directly on the prism to assure consistent point-of-aim at all times— regardless of whether or not the illumination is engaged. An additional yardage-marked turret cap (ballistic-matched to the 5.56 cartridge) allows the shooter to swap out the factory-installed cap for rapid dialing of known-distance shots out to 700 yards. At 11.2 ounces, the lightweight Spitfire AR excels in close to medium range shooting applications where speed is of the essence, making it the ideal choice for AR shooters who needs to get on target fast. Prism Scopes are not compatible with the VMX-3T Magnifier. Dual use for Shooting Tactical / Hunting     Optical Features    Fully Multi-Coated Multiple anti-reflective coatings on all air-to-glass surfaces increase light transmission.   Prism-Based Design Delivers sharp optics and allows for unique reticle designs that are visible with or without illumination.   Brightness Settings Provides 12 variable illumination settings—adjusts for use in very dim to very bright lighting conditions.        Construction Features    Single-Piece Chassis Compact and lightweight.   Nitrogen Gas Nitrogen gas purging with o-rings-seals delivers fogproof, waterproof performance.   Waterproof O-ring seals prevent moisture, dust and debris from penetrating for reliable performance in all environments.   Shockproof Rugged construction withstands recoil and impact.   Hard Anodized Finish Highly durable low-glare matte finish.   Operating Temperature Rated from -22 degrees to +122 degrees Fahrenheit.        Convenience Features    Mount Height Comes mounted at a lower 1/3 co-witness height of 40.4 mm from the optic center to base surface.   Adjustable Brightness Provides five levels of brightness intensity with red and green illumination settings.   Red/Green Reticle Option Allows shooters a choice of dot color.   Battery Life 14-hour auto-shutdown feature maximizes battery life. Typical battery life is 250 hours at maximum brightness and 3,000 hours at minimum brightness setting.

I just like the gun pristine, being an enthusiast and a collector. However, Now that I'm 21 years of age, I'm looking to get a glock 19 for concealed carry, and for my purposes, the Kriss Vector isn't practical to own any more. I feel I'm better off selling it. I've mostly had it in it's carrying case, as I never got a proper display case made.Despite it's disuse, I would clean and oil it once every 6 months. It's in exellent condition, with little to no wear. Feel free to call or text ahead for information or to organize a sale!

I have a Ruger SR40c for sale or trade.  This is the compact model.  Stainless slide/barrel with black polymer frame.  Comes with one compact mag (9 round capacity) for concealed carry, and one extended mag (15 round capacity).  Sale includes everything pictured:  the gun with two mags, mag loader, factory hard plastic case and Ruger paperwork.  The sale also includes 4 boxes of ammo (50 rounds of American Eagle 180grain FMJ, 50 rounds of Remington 180grain FMJ, and two boxes of Hornady Critical Defense FTX).This gun is a few years old, but well cared for and never abused.  It's accurate and reliable.  Not picky on ammo - it shoots anything you feed it.  The mag options are great for switching between concealed carry and range days.  Only reason Im selling is because I acquired another handgun recently and need to make room in the safe.
This is for local sale only.  I will not accept payment online, and will not ship.  Of course I will be happy to meet you at the range so you can test fire before you buy.  I can meet at the Belton Gun Club near Anderson or the PSA range in Greenville if you'd like to test fire.NOTE:  Buyer must be at least 21 years old and must be willing to complete a SC Firearms Bill of Sale."

Won't find one at a better price. No tradesProduct Code: MAG598-BLKFrom Magpul:The Magpul M-LOK AFG (Angled Fore Grip) is the result of research and refinements done to the original AFG and AFG-2. By integrating the direct-attach M-LOK mounting system with minimalist construction we were able to produce a high strength grip that only weighs 1.2 ounces, including hardware. Allowing for a wider range of mounting location options, the M-LOK AFG is ¾"" shorter than the AFG-2 while maintaining a similar gripping surface area. Even though the M-LOK AFG is more compact than its predecessors it continues to take into account natural body mechanics to provide a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore grips, the M-LOK AFG helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots. All hardware necessary for attachment directly to M-LOK Slots on either aluminum or polymer hand guards and forends is included."

It is lightweight, accurate and fast handling. I believe it it be superior to an AK-47 and many other people do also. VZ 58 Comparison to AK-47 Type Rifle with Stamped Receiver: – The vz. 58 has a milled receiver. Most AK-47 type rifles are stamped. – Even with the milled receiver, it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK-47. – CNC machining on a vz. 58 receiver takes 2 1/2 hours; a stamped AK-47 receiver takes seconds to produce. – The vz. 58 receiver is completely enclosed, preventing debris from entering the receiver. – The bolt of the vz. 58 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. – The vz. 58 can be reloaded with stripper clips while the magazine is inserted in the rifle. – The vz. 58 has a more natural point of aim and is faster handling. – The safety is more ergonomic, making a faster first shot possible with the vz. 58. – The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the vz. 58. – The vz. 58 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools. – The alloy magazine of the vz. 58 is half the weight of the steel AK-47 magazine. (.42 lbs vs. .84 lbs) – The vz. 58 is striker-fired, unlike the hammer-fired AK-47.
