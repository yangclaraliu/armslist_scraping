Description
The Springfield M1A SOCOM II is a semi-automatic carbine chambered in 7.62 NATO or .308 Win. The M1A is the civilian version of the famous M14, which was once a standard issue US military rifle. It was also known to be very accurate and reliable. Springfield offers eight models different models of the M1A and the Socom II is the top of the line.
What makes the SOCOM II different from the SOCOM 16 is its cluster rail system made by Vltor. There are Picatinny rails on the top, bottom and sides of the carbine for easy mounting of optics or accessories.
The SOCOM II is gas-operated, so propellant gases are captured by a tube near the muzzle, which directs the gas into a valve on the bolt, and the gas pushes the bolt back so it can eject a spent casing and chamber a fresh round.
Features of the SOCOM II include a two-stage military trigger that sets off the action with a 5- to 6-pound pull. It has military sights that are adjustable for windage and elevation. It has a tritium dot front sight, so shooters can see it at night. And it has a synthetic stock. It features a gas cut off switch for suppressed shooting."

I hate to sell it, but times are tough right now and I want this to go to a home that will value and appreciate it. What I have for sale is a Winchester Model 1894 Lever Action chambered in the timeless 38-55 cartrige. The year of manufacture was 1902. The stock of this rifle does have two small chips in it (pictures of these chips are avaliable upon request). The bluing is still good and there is zero rust and hardly any pitting. Pictures can be provided of detailed condition. For a rifle that is over 100 years old, I would say that it is in remarkable condition. This gun was not a safe queen (but has been for the past 30 years). Attached are a few photographs of the rifle. Guns like this are going from $3,000 - $10,000 on gunbroker and from $3,500 - $5,500 at Winchester Gallery of Guns in Ft. Worth. I am up for negotiation and or trades. Please do not contact me if you aren't serious about purchasing or trading. I know what I have and I know the value of it.  Winchester Gallary of Guns in Ft. Worth did a deep cleaning of this rifle. They went through it with a fine tooth comb to verify that it was still safe to shoot etc. They have given me a verbal appraisal of the rifle now that they've completely gone through it and their private party value ie. me to you is $2,750.00 and their insurance value is $3,100.00. Of course Cash is King but I would be willing to trade for a long range setup in either 300wm. 6.5 Creedmore, .338 Lapua, or an IWI Tavor X95.

I bought it brand new 2 summers ago, its sat in my safe since then. Not a single round through the barrel. It's OD green from the factory; the Troy industries foregrip comes with it; it's the aluminum job that will screw in half if desired and is waterproof. It comes with 2 gen 3 pmags loaded with federal 62 grain green tip ammo. Nice stuff. I am an AR10 guy, it's a shame such a nice gas piston rifle sits without use. The price is VERY fair; I do not need to sell. It's a darn decent deal if someone wants to buy it. No one else has ever held it besides me. And that was to put it in the safe. No trades, just cash.

It's modeled after the M76 8MM yugoslavian army battle rifle and breaks down and services just like any other AK pattern rifle.Rifle has an adjustable gas block and is is in relatively new condition; has only had about 100 rounds (non-corrosive) through it and was meticulously cleaned after last firing.Handles about any ammunition you could throw into it: function checked it with several brands, from Brown Bear to Winchester Gold Medal and all functioned without a failure (it safely fires 7.62 NATO as well, since the SAAMI chamber pressure rating of 7.62 is actually lower than .308).Originally, the rifle shipped with two 5rd magazines, but they were absolute trash, so I bought three 20rd Csspecs (very high quality steel) magazines that feed reliably (they list for around $50 each). Rifle will come with all three magazines. FYI, the rifle's furniture is interchangable with all M76 furniture, so if you wanted to, you could install rails or a wooden stock and grip relatively easily. Accepts all standard AK dovetail mounts.Asking $550Might consider trades, worst case scenario I say no.Would prefer to meet in the reston/falls church/vienna area, I work in Maryland, so I have to run home and grab the rifle to meet.Thanks for reading!"

The primary one was the Model 1911A1, and its slightly different predecessor the Model 1911. Changes between the two designations occurred about 1924. They differ in minor details such as the A1 had an arched mainspring housing and the earlier model had a flat one. However, those two items were easily interchanged which can cause confusion. A surer way to discern a sample’s origin is a glance at the frame just behind the trigger. The 1911A1 has bevels there while the 1911 does not. An even more positive way to tell them apart is to just look at the serial number. After serial number 700,000 the U.S. Government considers military owned .45 automatics to be Model 1911A1s but before that they are Model 1911s.Regardless, both models were basically the same: they chamber the .45 ACP, with magazine capacity of seven rounds, have 5″ barrels, dovetailed rear sights with tiny blade fronts staked into the slide. The only sight adjustment possible is drifting the rear sight in its dovetail for windage. You have to live with the elevation point of impact with military loads using 230 grain FMJ bullets doing a nominal 830 fps.All 1911/1911A1s were supposedly sighted for 50 yards, but shooters’ eyes and personal firing techniques make that a hit and miss factor — literally! Finish on 1911s was a dull blue, but by World War II 1911A1s were given the Parkerized finish then used on all American military weapons. Grips did change slightly from checkered walnut on pre-World War II ones of either variation to checkered plastic during World War II."
