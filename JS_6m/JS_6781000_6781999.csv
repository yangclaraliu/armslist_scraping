This allows you to mount anyKeyMod attachment anywhere on your rail while being able to mount most Picatinny accessories directly tothe rail in the areas where the PicMod feature is present.This gives you the most mounting options without having to use KeyMod mounted Picatinny rail sections,adding unnecessary width and weight to your rifle.ADJUSTABLE GAS BLOCKThe MOD 2 comes with three easy to use gas block settings.Position 1 is recommended for for all types of ammunitionand conditions when not using a suppressor.Position 2 is for use with low powered ammunition whenusing a suppressor.Position 3 is recommended for normal suppressor use withnormal and high powered ammunition.SUPERIOR FITEverything about the MOD 2 has been designed to be an incredibly accurate fit and finish, including the newhandguard mounting system, which features a trunnion machined into the upper receiver.ENHANCED TRIGGERThe MOD 2 comes with an enhanced trigger, set from the factory at a crisp 5.5 pounds.Each trigger is custom adjusted at the factory, to ensure perfect performance, every time you squeeze.THE NEW BUFFER TUBEThe new PWS EBT is impact extruded from 7075 to enhance strength and rigidity, and anodized in mil specttype 3 to exceed standards in hardness and corrosion protection.We’ve added a new Ratchet-Lock Design to eliminate the need to stake the castle nut, and gives a rock solidlock up while being able to be removed easily if needed in the future.AMBIDEXTROUSWe’ve added ambidextrous controls for the safety selector, bolt release, and mag release to enhance theease of use.FURNITURE & MAGAZINEEvery MOD 2 rifle comes complete with a Bravo Company grip and stock, as well as a lancer magazine.MK114.223Weight – 6lbs 2.8 ozBarrel Length – 14.58 pinned and welded to 16.25""Overall Length – 31.38Gas Piston System – CarbineBarrel Twist – 1:8"

The conventional thought that ""only a bolt action could be considered a precision rifle"" has been in contention ever since.  With numerous upgrades available, the LR-308 is the ultimate long range target and competition rifle. The LR-308, the first and foremost of the .308 line, and for which the rifle series is named, is a rifle to be reckoned with. So much so that it was named the NRA Rifle of the year in 2005.  Description  ""I have fired virtually every gas operated precision rifle in production and the DPMS Panther 308 is the most accurate ""out of the box"" gas operated rifle I have ever tested, with accuracy on par with most bolt action precision rifles.

The rifle appears to have had almost no use. The metal looks like new, has a perfect bore and is possibly unfired. Its original owner who happens to be my late dad was obviously very proud of his fine rifle so added a little extra stock finish over the original and dabbed some gold paint into the checkering to really spruce her up. It wouldn’t take too much effort to buff out the extra finish on the stock and scrape out the paint to make it look like new again, then matching the metal. Stock LOP is 13 5/8” with Pachmayr pad."

892,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6781892,For Sale:  Taurus PT1911  45cal.,"mantua, Akron, Ohio",$ 400,"Listed On: Monday, May 1, 2017",Handguns,Taurus                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,no type,Pistol,"Review:This  PT1911 comes standard with these features: ambidextrous extended safeties, Taurus safety lock in the rowel (Commander-style) hammer, three-dot fixed combat sights, ventilated long trigger, flat backstrap, 8-round magazine (one came with my test pistol) with bumper pad, finely checkered frontstrap and backstrap, checkered synthetic “Double Diamond” style Taurus grips, extended beavertail grip safety, and front cocking serrations. Clearly this is not a bargain basement gun.
The Taurus PT1911 comes with a matte blue finish, giving it a businesslike appearance. Note that the finish is blue and not a modern rust-resistant finish such as Nitex, which means that more attention will need to be given to exterior maintenance
The only thing I did to the PT1911 prior to the range test was to wipe off the extra surface lubrication. I started shooting using the 230-grain FMJ load. From beginning to end, the Taurus PT1911 ran flawlessly. No “break-in” shooting needed here or other excuses for poor initial performance—just the kind of performance one hopes for out of any combat pistol.
The trigger was crisp and broke at around 5 pounds. The sights were aligned to the point of aim and easy to pick up. I enjoyed the mystic feel of this quality 1911 in the hand, which was clearly improved by the fine checkering on the front and backstrap. At 30 feet, the first eight-round group fired two-handed standing landed in a nice 3.5-inch cluster. After a bit more trigger time and a switch to the V-Crown load, I was rewarded with a 2-inch seven-shot group at the same 30 foot distance.
Backing off to 100 yards, I switched back to the SIG FMJ loads. Firing a total of five rounds from the two-handed standing position, I managed a remarkable group. Three of the five rounds fired ended up in another 3.5-inch group in the center of the silhouette! A fourth shot, undoubtedly the product of a lapse in concentration, ended up low and to the right in the leg of the silhouette. The fifth round fired, the product of an even bigger lapse in concentration, ended up somewhere entirely off the paper. Folks, if this pistol can produce this level of accuracy at 100 yards, it is capable of doing anything you could possibly require of it at any standard pistol distance in terms of precision.- Scott WagnerCOMEs: WITH: Case,1 Mag , Cleaning Brush .
