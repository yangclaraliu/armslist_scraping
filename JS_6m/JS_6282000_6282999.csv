Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation - one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. In addition, in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need to re-rack the slide. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.This pistol is being sold because I have bills to pay, and too many toys sitting around. I've added a right-hand Raven Concealment Phantom holster, and only fired around 50 rounds through this pistol.

Fired 46 rounds through it this weekend and all went off without a hitch. Great shooter...because its a Sig. More pictures available, can only post 3.Looking to get $425 for it, or looking for a single stack 9mm or preferrably .45ACP. Really interested in the Springfield XDs line.

Or some AR ""pistol"" that is pieced together from random manufacturers advertised as an SBR that probably wont even cycle after a dozen rounds. Its a good, reliable rifle with tasteful and quality Magpul furniture (I wrapped it in the MARPAT camo as the person it was supposed to go to was planning on joining the Corps... I thought it would be funny. Ive since removed it but ill give you the wrap if you want). The optic is okay... it does the job and ive found them to be reliable. Plus! you wont feel guilty throwing it around and banging it up seeing as you can replace it for around $80. Im sure i have some slings, mag-pouches, and some other stuff i can find and ill throw in for free.    If you seem shady, dont bring an ID, or come off ""gangsta"" you will be turned away. I will take off $50 for any LEOs, Military, Fire, or EMS, and ill even throw in some ammo.

I got this in a trade and haven't shot it very much other than at the range, when I got it, it came from an older gentleman who had bought it and only shot it a couple times, the gun has less than 100 rounds through it, as I personally have put 50 rounds of 38. Special through it and 25 rounds of .357 Magnum, very sweet shooter that has barely any recoil even with Magnum rounds going through it. this is drilled and tapped for sights all you need is a picatinny rail, screws, and a scope and you have a great hunting revolver, very accurate even with the ""Iron"" sights. This is the 6.5"" barrel and Stainless Steel I'm not sure but this might be the model X that you can get a 9mm Parabellum cylinder for. I have 25 round sof Winchester Hollow Points and an unopened box of Federal Premium Hydra-Shok rounds, perfect for carrying in the woods for protection! price includes the ammo gun and holster, the holster is a simple Allen brand holster that I'm ctually very impressed with as the quality is Excellent, light wear if you can call it that, more like the leather softening up.I will not separate any of the listed items, this is a package deal. As I said Cash is King but I am looking to trade for a running and driving car or truck, no preference other than No trashed Transmissions, No trashed Engines. it MUST run and drive and have no ""Needs head gasket"", ""I locked up the Engine"", or ""Only starts in 3rd gear"". other than that Firearms are great, just no black powder pepperbox pistols, or modern BP rifles, mix of guns and cash welcome as well."

I got this in a trade and haven't shot it very much other than at the range, when I got it, it came from an older gentleman who had bought it and only shot it a couple times, the gun has less than 100 rounds through it, as I personally have put 50 rounds of 38. Special through it and 25 rounds of .357 Magnum, very sweet shooter that has barely any recoil even with Magnum rounds going through it. this is drilled and tapped for sights all you need is a picatinny rail, screws, and a scope and you have a great hunting revolver, very accurate even with the ""Iron"" sights. This is the 6.5"" barrel and Stainless Steel I'm not sure but this might be the model X that you can get a 9mm Parabellum cylinder for. I have 25 round sof Winchester Hollow Points and an unopened box of Federal Premium Hydra-Shok rounds, perfect for carrying in the woods for protection! price includes the ammo gun and holster, the holster is a simple Allen brand holster that I'm ctually very impressed with as the quality is Excellent, light wear if you can call it that, more like the leather softening up.I will not separate any of the listed items, this is a package deal. As I said Cash is King but I am looking to trade for a running and driving car or truck, no preference other than No trashed Transmissions, No trashed Engines. it MUST run and drive and have no ""Needs head gasket"", ""I locked up the Engine"", or ""Only starts in 3rd gear"". other than that Firearms are great, just no black powder pepperbox pistols, or modern BP rifles, mix of guns and cash welcome as well.Email me or text to 1(256) 3 Nine Three - Zero 2 7 Seven"

I have never had a malfunction with this gun at the range and I always clean it thourougly after an outing. This model has all stainless controls and is made in the USA. 1x 15 round magazine is included. MUST HAVE NC CCW OR PERMIT & NC DR LICS.The 92FS is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions."
