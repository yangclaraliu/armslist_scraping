This is chambered in 7.62x39. I started this as a project to make a rifle while I waited on a Form 1 for an SBR side folder and I've just never finished it. This gun is BRAND NEW and unfired. I had zero interest in shooting it as a pistol and like I said, I've just never finished it.Gun comes in the box as it would brand new. I've added a traditional polymer AK-47/74 style pistol grip and I also have the Yugo M70 grendade spigot a.k.a. barrel extention to pin and weld. OH and I've got the 26mm to 14mm adaptor or you can have the front gas block cut and threaded to 14mm, I've seen AK smiths do both.Between the cost of the PAP, getting it shipped, FFL fee's etc, I'm sitting right about $620~630.00 dollars without the thread adaptor and barrel extention.I also have a CNC Warrior shorty Krinkov muzzle brake that was another $50 dollars shipped I will throw in if you plan to keep this a pistol OR plan to run a brace of some type on it. Actually either way, I'll throw that in so if you SBR this down the road.Good luck finding one of these locally, I hear I would trade this even for something like a newer WASR-10 or some other flavor of full-size AK. Heck the WASR-10 costs less than I've got into all of this.I would also trade for some type of full-size 9mm range pistol. I would like an HK P30 9mm, HK P2000 9mm, FNX-9 9mm, GLOCK 17 Gen4, GLOCK 19 Gen4 etc. I listed some other trades below."

This is a drop in conversion kit that takes no gunsmithing. Just take off the current slide and install this one and you now have a .22 lr on your Sig P229. This is only made for the NON-RAILED P229's and will not work on the pistols with the light rail on the bottom. This is not some aftermaket product made by someone else. I purchased this directly from Sig Sauer and have only fired it a few times. It is not something I have used that often and have decided to sell it. It comes from the factory with one magazine and I purchased a second one from them. This is all factory made Sig Sauer equipment. If you want to meet at a range and see if it fits your pistol prior to purchase that is fine. Like all Sig firearms this thing is super accurate. Thanks for looking.

Utilizing the ubiquitous STANAG magazine used in the AR-15/M16, the 805’s action is housed in a one-piece aluminum upper receiver with a monolithic Picatinny rail. At the rear of the action is a multipurpose mounting point, fit from the factory with a single-point sling attachment. The addition of our accessory arm brace adapter coupled with the effective factory-equipped two-port brake makes the Bren impressively stable to shoot in pistol form. It shares the same low-profile sights as our Scorpion — an adjustable aperture rear and post front. The CZ 805 Bren S1 Pistol is legally classified by the ATF as a pistol, and is intended by CZ-USA to be used as a pistol. Under current federal law and ATF policy attaching a stock to this pistol – or attaching a device which is then used as a stock or intended to be used as a stock – constitutes the making of a short-barreled rifle which requires registration with ATF and the payment of the applicable tax. Users of the CZ 805 Bren S1 Pistol bear the sole responsibility for ensuring their use of the firearm complies with all local, state, and federal firearms laws.SKU: 91360Cash Discount Price Listed"

Comes with just shy of 500 rounds of ammo, 9 30rd mags, 1 drum mag. All great condition, front site is straight, accurate gun. Only reason I'm looking to get rid of it is because I have nothing else chambered in 7.62x39. 
If you're looking to make money on the deal, barking up the wrong tree. I would consider dropping cash for the right deal, but not for some stock $500 AR with 10,000 rounds down the tube. Ive wheeled and dealed and sold guns for a living. Not my first rodeo. I'm looking for straight up fair offer where both parties are comfortable, I'm not looking to screw anyone or make $$ of of this deal, really looking for something straight up. We aren't dealing with transfer fees, taxes, etc. I would prefer if you have a WI CCW. 
Look around on here. WASR 10 underfolder with 1 mag they're asking 700. Budsgunshop (last place I saw actually list these new) was over $700 for the gun and 2 mags. I'm reasonable, this is very low round count in excellent condition. Trade value I'm placing on the package is as follows.Rifle $625 (Last known retail $700+)Mags $8 a piece (8x9) (Retail $10ish a piece)Drum Mag $65 (Retail $90)Ammo (Russian Bear ""brand"" ammo, Steel Cased non laqured) $90 (Retail $130)Add in shipping, taxes, transfer fees from FFL's, and you're looking $1100 retail.So trade value I'm looking at $850 range (?). Please, do research, look around and try and find these guns. Your local gun shop, fleet farm, and even online vendors don't carry them anymore because they're no longer imported. Feel free to shoot me an offer, but don't ask for my package, +$600 for your beat gun. 
I'm looking at doing a package deal only. 
Accepting cash offers as of now, found a gun for sale that I would like, but if it moves before I get cash I'll go back to trade."
