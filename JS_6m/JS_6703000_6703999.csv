For peak accuracy, the R-15’s 0.680″ OD barrel is precision-crafted from ChroMoly steel. It’s free-floated within the machined-aluminum forend tube and given a recessed hunting crown to ensure gases escape evenly around the bullet for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block promote rapid barrel cooling and increase rigidity while reducing weight, further contributing to this rifle’s ability to print tiny clusters at an incredible pace.This hunting single-stage trigger design is as clean-breaking as they come. The semi-automatic gas action all but eliminates muzzle jump and recoil so your target remains in the crosshairs.

This gun features 13.5” length of pull from the trigger to the factory crescent butt plate. This gun is in very excellent overall. The box is worn and the Cardboard sleeve shows many years of wear.  Has hang tig and paper work.  I have 10 pictures of this firearm.  Drop me a line to see more.  I am grading this one 99%.  Reason is for just for the handling of it over the years.  Just very minor handing marks.  These dont come around very often.  Great addition to any collection.  We also have the ""Bat Masterson"", ""Buffalo Bill"", ""Oliver Winchester"" and ""Theodore Roosevelt"".  Check out all our other listings.  We trade!  Give us a call with what you have.  We also buy!"

We rate it at app. 60 o/oof condition overall with the only problem bieng that the 'stud hole' is in poor condition ( not unusual for this vintage) but easily repaired to servicable condition.2- The overall finish retains a solid 75 o/o of the original 'Black'( with a couple of minor exceptions which will be noted below) and a small number of nicks on the sharp edges as well as some slight surface nicks around the entry port of the slide lock/ barrel link pin.3- Finish considerations include that the Bbl. bushing appears to be a replacement that has been with the arm for a long time; it is close to...but not exactly the same color of blue nor does it show the expected parts marks on the ears.. The safety lever is not as well finshed as the rest of the parts and appears to be a replacement.. it, too, does not match in patina or color.4- All of the checkering is better than expected.5- The grips are completly intact, with distinct checkering and the screws are 95 o/o...not at all buggered.6- The barrel is a good tight fit in the reciever/slide lock-up. It is grey and shows surface flecking but not pitting... there appeard to be about 60 o/o rifeling remaining...just off of 'sharp'.7- There is some looseness in the fit of the of the barrel link parts... this is not a problem and is generally expected. It is easily rectified with readily available and inexpensive parts. This condition is not dangerous but should be rectified sooner than later because it leads to excessive wear on other parts and can result in light hammer hits.8- the condition of the magazine is ""good' it retains a high 80 o/o of original finish but is rough to the touch and does not drop free... it will take a bit of detailing to make it just right.For sale locallyI prefer cash."

I cannot believe that a military arm of this age could retain as good a finish as this has.The Lyman 'peep sight' is in good repair although most of the blue finish is gone and it really needs to be cleaned.There are no issues with the bolt although it is not serieled to the reciever... this is not unusual in older military arms.The forward barrel to stock retaining band has been slightly deformed... you have to look close to discover this.. and it does not comprimise the retention.Overall this is a very nice piece and shows no sign of abuse or neglect.I prefer cashFor Sale locally"
