This thing is an excellent self defense or carry gun. The gun is in *perfect* mechanical shape - I baby all my guns and this one was no exception. I shot just a few hundred rounds through it (less than 500) and it's been cleaned and lubricated with FrogLube. It has never failed or hiccupped or malfunctioned. The only thing that isn't perfect is that it shows a bit of wear on the finish towards the muzzle due to a holster I've since gotten rid of.
It comes with the two factory magazines (one 6round flush mag, one pinky grip 8round) and an additional factory magazine I purchased (6round flush).
I've applied rubberized Talon grips to it, which are wonderful and make the gun much more pleasant and grippy in the hands. If you want to go back to the factory smooth plastic finish, you can just peel them off and apply a little rubbing alcohol to remove the adhesive completely. 
It comes with a Blackpoint Tactical IWB holster, which go for around ~80 retail.
It also comes with the factory box and factory security lock.
It also comes with a spare firing pin assembly. You likely won't need it, I only bought it in order to reach the ""free shipping"" threshold on an online order, but hey, if anything in your firing pin assembly breaks, you'll be set.
I will only sell to folks who have a valid Georgia Weapons License. No exceptions.
I can meet you at any reputable public place in the Atlanta area. I respond quickly to messages, usually within 30 minutes. Feel free to contact me with offers or questions. Thanks for looking!"

This particular example was built in April of 1943 so there is a very good chance it saw lots of action in the war. The rifle is a CMP certified rifle and comes with certificate of authenticity and CMP hard case. The rifle appears to have a GI stock set with nicely matching wood. The stock and handguards have visible cartouches along with some other import markings. There are some small dents and dings adding to the character of the rifle. The rifle has a 44' SA barrel and bolt, SA trigger group, HRA op rod, and WRA trigger guard. The rifle is in great shape and is a excellent shooter. I'm asking $975 obo. No trades please.

It weighs a little less than 3 pounds. These guns did not have serial numbers. On the barrel of the gun is the following” Manufactured by Winchester Repeating Arms, New Haven, Conn, USA, Aug 29, 1899, Model 36 Shotgun, Cal. 9MM Rim Fire, Winchester Trade Mark Reg. US Pat. Office & FGN”. There is an oval with the letters P over a W that is just forward of the receiver and also on the front of the bolt. I have had this gun for about 3 years and have never fired it. I have lightly swabbed the inside and outside of the barrel and rubbed the stock with a very light coat of oil. The shells are still available thru Froichi.  I had the gun informally appraised by a gun buyer in my area for the purpose of trading. He stated that the condition is in the 80% range. Based upon his appraisal it is all original including the unbroken and uncracked butt plate. There is some minor pitting at the very end of the barrel and it has most of the original bluing. The barrel is in good condition with some minor pitting. Mechanically the gun functions as expected. All original hardware."

Hunting season is upon us and this rifle is one of the most accurate rifles I've ever fired. This is a hunters dream. It is sighted and ready to go. The stock is a custom hand carved dual stained beauty. The pictures are amazing, but they don't do it justice. It hardly has recoil and you can send a second shot right through the previous shot's hole in a target from a hundred yards at ease. This particular brand is famous in Pennsylvania where it originates. The brand is no more as the owner died without heirs to the name. It is very rare and very collectible. You will not find another anywhere online....try a search. Other rifles made by Flaig go for over $2,500. I am giving this away. Ammo is still sold in stores and I have two 20ct 140gr boxes you can have as well as 3 Tipton bore brushes. This is an ideal hunting rifle, but it would make a great wall decoration for a sportsman enthusiast. I can be reached by text at REDACTED.  I'm a motivated seller."

It's all factory original, other than the grip screws. I replaced the grip screws with the hex head screws. The pistol is absolutely flawless. The finish is without blemish. It's a beautiful gun. It's solid and heavy and shoots smooth. Absorbs the 10mm recoil very well. I've got the original plastic case with everything it came with...manual, lock, 2 magazines, etc. I've also got a .45 extended 10 round magazine that holds 11 rounds of 10mm and functions in the gun. I would prefer to trade, but I'm willing to sell. My price is firm, because it's in absolutely perfect condition, and they're tough to find in stock. I paid $1,200, and I spent another $20 on the grip screws and $40 on the extended mag. I would really just prefer to trade. Thanks."
