I had it built as my camp gun for an extended 2 month trip into NW montana & BC. I had Jim Brokman out of Gooding Idaho give it the full treatment.

It has never been in the field but I did take it to the range to check for accuruacy/function. I shot 2 boxes of Hornady 325gr and it shot right at an inch at 100yds. At 200yds I shot moa also. I rang the gong with it at 600 yds, It is accurate. I also shot 6 hot buffalo bore loads and the recoil pad worked well. I didnt sight in the skinner and have the kit from Brockman for it. (special file etc).The only thing I didnt add to it at the time was a large lever loop as I wasnt planning on being in that country in the winter. I want $2300 for the rifle. Can't get one put together for any less and also not have to wait half a year to get it back!I am in Southern Oregon. Not the rifle for this area so I posted it where there is a use for it. Will ship to local FFL."

I've also added some weight to the rear in the stock and buffer tube.  The weight can be adjusted or removed, but it balances the rifle very nicely.  There is a quad rail on the front that works great for mounting anything you want to mount.  Stock sights are included, but sorry, the Leupold sight is not.The wood furniture cost me over $175, and it's one-off custom, so you will definitely be the only one at the range looking like this!I would sell the gun with original plastic furniture for $375.  And again, the Leupold is not for sale.My price is firm, but I might be interested in partial trade for a stainless Ruger Old Army or Ruger Bearcat - let me know what you have!Unfortunately we'll have to go through an FFL for transfer.   I do know one in South Mt Vernon that will do it for only $25.

Additionally there's a blackhawk 3-point sling, stock magazine pouch, flashlight mount, blackhawk foregrip, and the standard foregrip. For magazines, there are 6 aluminum magazines and 3 magpul p-mags.The ammo is 900 rounds of 5.56mm NATO or .223 remington.
