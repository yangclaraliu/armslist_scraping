This rifle was purchased basically new from original owner. Used in 3 matches and has had less than 200 rounds down the pipe. Overall very good condition, with a few toothpick sized dents in the wood but did not penetrate the finish. Bluing has a little bit of wear on the barrel bands and some very light wear to the receiver. Feed tray has been lightly gone over with emory cloth to remove roughness and make for better feeding. Overall a very nice rifle, but I have 2 and only need one. Am willing to ship to FFLs out of IL and can do FTF provided you give me your FOID/DOB before hand to run a validation check.

I bought another ten (10) round mag and two (2) more seventeen (17) round mags with sleeve adapters. If you live in Cook County, like I do, you know how difficult it is to have magazines over ten (10) rounds shipped to you. I also bought a holster from Concealment Express that I've been carrying it in for the past year. The firearm has been shot and carried regularly and shows signs of wear but functions flawlessly.

The upper has no serious flaws in in the finish that I can see. It came without the usual BCM white laser markings on the rear by the charging handle but is engraved ""BCM4"" on the end of the receiver just above the gas tube port in the front of the flat top.The lower I bought a while back when I first started planning the build. I got a deal on a SAA ""OAF15"" lower, liked the bare-bones, no obnoxious logo look of it.The guns overall length is 26 3/4"" from the end of the buffer tube to the end of the threaded end of the barrel, making it legal to mount a vertical grip. However, by doing so you take it out of the ""Pistol"" classification and in turn it becomes a ""firearm"" it is legal to own and shoot in the configuration, however it is no longer a pistol and cannot be concealed loaded in this configuration.Upper Receiver- BCM ""Blem"" upper assembled with BCM parts.- 10.5"" Black Hole Weaponry Barrel 1:7 twist Polygonal Rifled barrel, .750 gas block journal. Carbine length has system.- BCM low profile gas block and carbine length gas tube- BCM KMR 10 Alpha keymod handguard.

Firing pin, firing pin retaining pin, and cam pin all BCM factory parts. - Brownells charging handle with Badger Ordinance Extended bolt latch.- B.E. Meyers 249f saker flash eliminator.

Can be activated left or right handed and is unobstructed around either left of right hand corners.- BCM angled vertical foregrip cut down to use as a handstop. Lower Receiver- SAA OAF15 lower receiver- B5 Systems lower build kit with B5 Systems pistol grip. Most comfortable AR grip I have found to date.- Geissele Super Dynamic 3 Gun (SD3G) 3.5lbs trigger- Midwest Indistries collared pistol buffer tube, buffer and spring. Also castle nut but used a Magpul QD endplate.- SB Tactical SBM4 Pistol Stablizing brace- Magpul BAD lever. Not standard in the manual of arms no, but it helps to speed up clearing of malfunctions, reloading, and emptying/showing clear considerably. - BlueForce Gear Special Edition 1"" Vickers sling for pistols and PDW's.Shoots phenomenally well! The 6.5moa dot makes getting sub-moa hits a little tough, but it still managing repeated 1.5in groups at 100m. No doubt in my mind this thing could maintain at least 1moa if not sub-moa under magnification.MORE PICTURES AVAILABLE TO TEXT OR EMAIL"
