This was done prior to Blue Sky.It looks like it has not fired many rounds. I did the quick bullet in the muzzle check, but don't have any gauges to check it further.I do not know the round count and I have not had a chance to take it to the range yet.This uses the same enbloc clips as the 30.06.It is also one of the more rare M1 Garands that has a lead dipped receiver heel, as can be seen by the difference in color at the receiver heel.The stock is RRA = Red River Arsenal. It is a g.i. issue stock and has dents and dings.Comes with 20 new AEC standard 8 round Enbloc clips, 1 CMP clip, and 1 new 5 round clip for hunting.Also has a repro sling."

Unfortunately, it isn't the scope I want for this particular rifle, so it is up for sale. This scope features an illuminated SCR Mil reticle, with matching 0.1 mil turrets. The reticle features a floating crosshair, that is fantastic for small targets at distance. The scope is mounted in a Nightforce X-Treme Duty 20 MOA Ti/Alloy base. The mount includes the optional top ring bubble level/ADI mount (standard top ring included as well.)The combo has fewer than 50 rounds through it, and is in like new condition, other than a few rubs from being in the safe. Nothing significant, just not LNIB. Scope also features Burris' lifetime warranty, which is fully transferrable. The Scope was $1250 new, the mount was $250 and the level was $100 alone. Total new was about $1600. Looking for $1050 for everything, or $900 without the Nightforce mount."

She has been socialized from an early age and is great around people and animals alike. She is pretty well house broken, but still has occasional accidents. It breaks my heart to get rid of her, but she needs someone to spend more time with her than I can at this time. I paid $1500 for her and had to make the 10.5 hour drive to pick her up. Howling Hills is in the top 3 true mid-high content breeders out there. They are not your typical backyard wolf dog operation.

Comes with 2ea 17 RD magsIt handles better than an AR or rifle style and is more practical because you can pair it with Berretta 92 9mm mags. Perfectly balanced and quick on target.Absolutely one of the coolest and most high-quality carbines ever produced. Rarely seen stateside the Beretta CX4 Storm 9MM is both highly unique and functional. Accepts all standard Beretta 92 pistol mags. The CX4 is a semi-auto pistol-caliber carbine designed to give you the familiar controls of your favorite Beretta combat handgun.It is perfect for shooters who are already familiar with Beretta tactical pistols, or more in general for those who may not have extensive experience with a rifle or carbine. However, the cold-hammer forged barrel delivers the sort of accuracy that even the most experienced shooters will appreciate. Easy to use, ultra-reliable and low-recoil, it has been adopted by several police agencies throughout the world and its versatility and accessorization options have made it a favorite of recreational shooters. Whether you use it for home-defense, varminting, competition or training, the CX4 will deliver what it promises.The CX4 is adaptable to accept any full-size Beretta PX4, 90-series and 8000 series magazines (using optional adapters), thereby saving existing Beretta users the expense of additional magazines. Along with its uncompromising Beretta quality, this is an additional reason why the versatility of this carbine is highly prized by tactical shooters. Along with a Beretta pistol, it helps create the best and most versatile tactical system available today, as evidenced by the CX4’s dedicated following.This light and compact carbine was designed to be completely and easily adaptable to the needs of most shooters. The operating handle, safety and magazine release are reversible and give you the opportunity to train or shoot right- or left-handed, while case ejection can also be switched from right to left. The aperture and post sights are user-adjustable, meaning that you can train with (or switch) your favorite brand of ammo without taking the carbine to a gunsmith. And after a day at the range, this carbine is a snap to take apart and reassemble, while its ultra-tough construction and surface treatment make it stand up to the hardest use. Comes with 2-17 round mags, cleaning kit, and mag loader.You must be 100% legal to purchase in GA and have an ID.
