I shot around 200rds and as far I remembered it, it shoots fine, everything is straight. Not clearly shown in the pictures below, but the top cover, safety lever and gastube all have matching numbers. The laminated wood handguards also the original that came from the kit, I cleaned them up and applied lots of tung oil.It had a cheese grater handguard and ACE folding stock before. The rear tang was cut to accommodate the ACE folding stock, both cheese grater upper and folding stock are gone. I've planned to turn it into a regular stock AKM, parkerize and refinish it AK black, but too many other projects. What's included:Polish AKM rifle.A brand new rear trunion, not installed. A cleaned up great condition Romanian laminated wood stock, no metal parts.Canis AR stock adapter ONLY, installed. NOT included: buffer tube, castle nut, magpul stock in the picture https://canis-design-group.myshopify.com/collections/stock-adapters/products/ak-to-m4-fixed-stock-adapter  US parts: Tapco hammer, trigger, disconnector.
