And “clone” isn’t exactly a fair description because this is a quality-made rifle by all accounts. It is in excellent condition, and shoots like it is supposed to, which means it's a battle rifle and not marksman's gun. I can do about a 3"" inch group at 100 yds, bench rest on a good day. I am selling mainly because my interests are going in a different direction, and I’d like to free up some room in my safe. It operates with a direct blow-back action, so it is not friendly to spent brass. One thing that I think is pretty cool about this particular rifle, is that it's stamped with PTR's original location in Farmington, CT, before they moved to South Carolina in the face of Connecticut's anti-gun legislation. To me, that makes it kind of collectible. It also has an enhanced recoil buffer, and the aftermarket flash hider you see in the pictures. I will sell this gun with the tri-rail front hand guard that came on it from the preceding owner, and a half-dozen box mags, most of which are original HK-made. There is also a clamp-on picatinny rail if you want to mount a scope. Please, no low-ball offers. If it comes to it, I’ll just stash it away until the Zombie Apocalypse."

It is used by many rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15 rifles, barrels, and upper receivers. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56x45mm but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition as the case dimensions are the same. In short, it will give you the accuracy of a real SAAMI when using the good ammo, but also allow you to use cheap surplus ball ammo safely. Please Google .223 Wylde if you are unfamiliar with this chamber. It is truly the best of both .223 and 5.56 chambers."

However, the Union arsenals had a million or more muzzleloading rifled muskets still on hand. How to modernize the weaponry without simply throwing away all those existing guns? The task was put to Springfield Arsenal master armorer Erskine Allin in 1864, and he devised a “trapdoor” style of conversion to turn an old Springfield muzzleloader into a breechloader. He had the benefit of having seen the previous year’s extensive trials of breechloaders, but the final product was his combination of what he judged to be the best elements of the ideas available. The result has long been known colloquially as the Trapdoor Springfield, and this 1864 model was the very first of them. It was still in .58 caliber, and used a rather complex extractor system. It would soon be revised to make improvements to it, and ultimately a .45-70 model became standard for US infantry and cavalry forces – and remained their standard until the adoption of the Krag-Jorgensen in the 1890s. 3% Surcharge on all Credit Card TransactionsNO CALIFORNIA SALES!"

The Firestar was available in 9 mm Para (model M43), .40 S&W (M40), and .45 ACP (M45) calibers, all having a single stack magazine. A double-stack 9 mm version (M243) was also available and was commonly referred to by the unofficial name ""Firestar Plus"". The Firestar was produced by now defunct Star Bonifacio Echeverria, S.A. in Eibar, Spain until 1994. The Firestar was imported into the United States by Interarms of Alexandria, Virginia.Although its external appearance resembles a compact M1911, the Firestar is different in several respects. For example, the Firestar does not have the 1911's grip safety. The Firestar's safey features include an automatic safety at the firing pin (a feature not included in the 1911's original [model 70] design but often found in more modern 1911 variants [model 80]). The Firestar has operating procedures analogous to those of the Colt 1911: it is single action, and meant to be carried in the Condition One, cocked and locked state, with a cartridge in the chamber, cocked hammer, and locked manual safety. [Ambidextrous safety standard on the M43].The Firestar is a compact, reliable and accurate handgun well-suited for backup or concealed carry. Its single-stack design sacrifices the superior capacity of a double-stack, but permits a slim profile prized by many for concealed carry. While heavier than more modern [polymer] handguns of comparable size made with today's composite materials, many shooters find the added heft provides a more stable shooting platform that improves accuracy."

Bought it in February this year an imeadiatly realized the factory 11# double action trigger just wasn't going to do it.Did extensive internet research to find one of the best S&W custom trigger out fits in the country, I found TK Custom on the East Coast, I was not disappointed, Eliin there shop did a tremendous job! Got the double action down to 6#, silky smooth, just incredible. Now guys I had this gun set up for action pistol competition, it's a load of fun to shoot and I've only shoot 200 rounds through it.TK Custom told me it would be best to run good brass with Federal primers through it for best results. Well I shoot 1911 in competition and use Federal primers so I thought I would just try what I already had loaded, ( used range brass with Federal primers ) wow 100% ignition! What a great trigger job.What I did find out is I need to stick to my 1911 in competition, I'm just not good at speed loading a revolver. My loss is your gain, looking for a good home.Ive got over 2k in this with the trigger job, gold bead front sight, Hoag cylinder release, moon clips and BT moon clip loader. Also got a Jerry Miculek wood grip that's included but not in the photo. Comes with all the stock factory trigger parts.

This particular rifle was manufactured during the period when Remington was transitioning from the Model 1903 Rifle to the Model 1903-A3 rifle. Transition rifles occur during an approximately 3 month period from December 1942 to February or early March 1943. There are no rebuild, arsenal marks or import stamps anywhere on this rifle. The stock on this 1903-A3 is the original and early Remington-manufactured “S” or straight stock for the 1903-A3 that is in excellent condition with the original finish. There are normal dings and handling marks on the stock and there is a small, 1 ½” hairline crack on the top to the rear of the receiver cutout that does not go all the way through and which remains solid. The left side of the stock has the correct Ordnance Escutcheon Stamp, followed by the correct boxed “FJA” cartouche of Colonel Frank J. Atwood, who was the U.S. Army Ordnance Inspector for the northeast United States during WWII, which encompassed Remington’s firearms plant at Ilion, New York. The sans serif “RA” Remington Arms stamp only appeared later on 1903-A3 stocks. The bottom of the wrist has the correct circle “P” firing proof without serifs as well as a serif “P” stamp just to the rear of the proof stamp. Just forward of the trigger guard recess are the Remington-typical sub-inspection stampings, which include two circles with numbers (“11” and “5”), a triangle with a “2” stamp and a square with “53.” In the trigger guard cutout is a serif “L” stamp.

The early proofs on the barrel shank of the Type 53 will have both Chinese characters and the number 26 or 296. The Chinese characters translate to "" 53 Year Type "" and the 26 or 296 are the stamping of the State Factory at Chongqing. In many later production Type 53's the Chinese characters are not present but it is not known why the characters were dropped. The shank proofs also became larger in 1960 but again the reason for this action is not entirely clear. The Chinese did not use the large number of stamps on the carbine's metal as their Soviet allies; however, the Chinese more than made up for this with the large number of proofs that appear on most Type 53 stocks. It is not uncommon to have ten or more various stamps on these stocks. The wood used on most of these stocks is not the high quality as that used in the Soviet carbines; however, the wood on the Type 53 is quite solid and competent. The Chinese utilized a local wood that is known as CHU-wood. The CHU-wood was put to use as it was quite effective in standing up to so called ""Jungle Rot."" The wood was quite proficient in resisting moisture, so was a perfect choice for the environment of Asia. There are some Type 53 stocks that have their serial numbers matched to the carbines, with these numbers appearing on the left side on the stock."

The custom holster is an $80 holster, specifically designed for this gun right in front of my eyes, but we'll say $60. The DeSantis holster was $25,we'll call it $20. The pistol came with one mag, and they're $35 each (average cost of a P345 magazine) but we'll just call it $35 total because getting a gun with one mag sucks. $450+$60+$20+$35=$565That should satisfy you number crunchers. That's not including the ammo.That all being said, I'm only looking for $400.If you're interested, then feel free to shoot me a message and we can talk.Thanks a lot."

Distinctive ""Browning Buckmark"" logo on top of slide. Fixed FIBER OPTIC sights. The difference between this weapon and the $500 base polymer model 1911-22 is this Black Label model is all metal and includes upgraded Commander trigger, Commander hammer, Target Crown, Beavertail safety and Fiber Optic sights. This weapon is being sold Like New In Box. It was ordered new by me, test fired with 10 rounds out of each of its two magazines and then given to my wife for a Christmas present. I am convinced it is the perfect gun to safely carry in a purse or pocket. It took her three months to admit that she'll never shoot it, let alone carry it. That's okay. She's made a conscious decision. I respect that. She likes that I'm armed, she just doesn't want to carry.Current official Browning MSRP is $604.95 including 1 magazine, documents, lock and case.

Payment is cash in bills no larger than $50, which will each be checked.Here is what the Browning.com website has to say about their 1911-22.John M. Browning developed the Model 1911 to fire the powerful 45 ACP cartridge. We (Browning) developed it to fire the 22 L.R. and, after extensive testing and research, determined that 85% of the original size was ideal for the smaller cartridge. Put one in your hands and we know that you'll agree. The grip is comfortable even in large hands and feels equally at home in smaller ones. The lightweight alloy construction is anything but light duty. Own a little piece of history today.The 10-round magazine has a heat-treated steel body and coil spring for long life and smooth, reliable feeding. The polymer magazine follower and base pad offer durability with low maintenance, and the twin follower relief buttons allow for easier loading.Just like the original 1911 design, the Browning 1911-22 has a crisp, clean single-action trigger pull for improved shootability. If you like the feel of the trigger on the orginal 1911, you'll love the trigger on the 1911-22.The slide and frame are precision machined from aircraft grade 7075 T6 allow for light weight and long life. A steel slide block encloses the firing pin and extractor, and a durable matte black anodized finish completes the overall package.The rimfire Browning 1911-22 is scaled at 85% of the full-size 1911. From its alloy slide and frame to its button-rifled, target crowned steel barrel, the Browning 1911-22 is reliable, accurate and designed to provide years of fast-shooting fun for the whole family."

The early proofs on the barrel shank of the Type 53 will have both Chinese characters and the number 26 or 296. The Chinese characters translate to "" 53 Year Type "" and the 26 or 296 are the stamping of the State Factory at Chongqing. In many later production Type 53's the Chinese characters are not present but it is not known why the characters were dropped. The shank proofs also became larger in 1960 but again the reason for this action is not entirely clear. The Chinese did not use the large number of stamps on the carbine's metal as their Soviet allies; however, the Chinese more than made up for this with the large number of proofs that appear on most Type 53 stocks. It is not uncommon to have ten or more various stamps on these stocks. The wood used on most of these stocks is not the high quality as that used in the Soviet carbines; however, the wood on the Type 53 is quite solid and competent. The Chinese utilized a local wood that is known as CHU-wood. The CHU-wood was put to use as it was quite effective in standing up to so called ""Jungle Rot."" The wood was quite proficient in resisting moisture, so was a perfect choice for the environment of Asia. There are some Type 53 stocks that have their serial numbers matched to the carbines, with these numbers appearing on the left side on the stock."

The Russians were searching for a weapon that was more fast handling and practical to carry and thus the M-44 was born. At only 40' overall, this is a very practical carry / hunting rifle and still retains a high degree of accuracy. Each rifle also incorporates a side folding bayonet. Very Good Condition."
