I am selling the rifle to fund a Russian AKM parts kit. The exact model number is Colt M4 LE6920MP-FDE. For full specs please visit http://www.gandermountain.com/modperl/product/details.cgi?i=914409I am the original owner of the rifle. I purchased it for $925 on 2/20/2015 from grabagun.com.Since purchasing it I replaced the wobbly MOE stock with a CTR stock with friction lock ($20 upgrade) and added a MBUS ($50). That puts me a little over $1,000 into it after FFL transfer fees. I am asking $850 cash, trade, or patrial trade for this unfired rifle in new condition. Included is everything you see in the picture, including the windowed FDE 30 round PMAG and the original box it came in. I have never fired the rifle but it did get a small safe bite on the forward assist, after that happened I put it back in the box. This is NOT a pieced together garage build or budget AR-15 , this is a true Colt M4. A couple of my buddys bought the same rifle at the same time and I have shot theirs and they are very solid weapons. This is part of the reason mine remained unfired because I would just shoot my ammo through theirs and not have to worry about cleaning it later.  I can text or e-mail additional pictures for those interested.Please DO NOT respond if you are either under the age of 18 or do not have a current Ohio driver's license!"

About 50,000 model 600s were produced in 1943-1945, but only the first 10,000 were delivered to the Germans before the Allied invasions at Normandy and Southern France. The remainders were held by Spain and a large number were subsequently sold to the nascent West German Police in the early 1950s, the Chilean Navy, and Portugal. Undoubtedly some were sold on the civilian market.The Model 600 is the ultimate of the Astra tube design, it started in 1912 with the Campo Giro and ended win the 1980s with the less than successful Model 8000 Condor and Model 4000 Falcon. The Model 600 is the apex of fit, finish and reliability for Astra pistols. Shooting one is not an experience one soon forgets."

It weighs in at just under 10 ounces (9.97 to be exact) without a magazine. The P380 is constructed of a black polymer frame, matte stainless slide, and textured polymer grips. The black polymer frame features 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength not found on competitive brands. The P380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, Kahr's six patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. These features result in a micro-compact pistol in a fighting caliber with very little felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The P380 does not have a magazine disconnect nor does it have ""double-strike"" capability. The P380 also boasts ""real"" sights, featuring drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights that dovetail into the slide.The quality of the tiny P380 from Kahr is unrivaled when compared to competitive brands. The barrel is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled design, allowing higher muzzle velocities for hollow point ammo than other conventional rifled barrels on competitive brands. The .75"" slide is machined from solid 416R stainless bar stock and locks back on the last round. The P380 model features two high quality 400 series stainless steel 6 round magazines, standard with each gun shipped. In addition, the P380 utilizes an all metal magazine catch in the polymer frame to mate with the stainless steel magazine. The magazines are USA made and are plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs, and feature Wolff Gunsprings.The P380 is substantially smaller than Kahr's popular PM9, and proves itself to be an ideal concealed carry weapon. Its light weight and small size, combined with Kahr's reputation for reliability, makes it the perfect pocket pistol. The P380 model is also a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement. The easy to use sights are just an added bonus to this already desired pistol."

The entire gun is in mint condition, and would rate a solid 95%. I would rate it 100%, but I've shot about 100 rounds in it, and there is a small chip in the wood's paint, about 1/4” long by 1/8” wide, on the edge of the stock immediately below the stock, which I touched up with stain. I am the original owner and the gun has been a safe queen since I bought it. The rifle has a folding style blade bayonet and has a cleaning kit in the stock. The gun has matching numbers on all metal components and on the stock. The magazine holds 10 rounds. The gun shoots great, and is ready to take to the range. See the pictures as they are part of this sale's description. More detailed photos can be taken on request. Shipping is $35.00 to the lower 48 United States via FEDEX, except California and New York. Absolutely no sales to those states. It must ship to an FFL. If your FFL requires that it be sent from an FFL, this is not a BATF requirement, so add another $35 to the shipping cost. Payment must be made within 7 days, by US Postal Money Order only, no exceptions. All questions will be answered, but spammers will be ignored.  Will trade - LOCAL ONLY - for a nice pocket sized Kimber 9mm, nothing else."
