It has an aftermarket bolt handle that is round (tactical look) and a 28 inch barrel that will fire all lengths of 12 gauge shells. It has a barely (and I mean barely) bent rib that takes a straight edge to even notice (only the rib not the actual shooting tube), however we have patterned it multiple times and it is in fine working order with a nice looking pattern. The shotgun is a straight and fine shooter with no issues other than I want to sell it. Many a duck and dove have fallen to it in the last couple of years. I'm only looking to sell for cash. I can't drive very far from Camden or Waverly area as I work daily. TXT ME AT REDACTEDWill entertain all reasonable offers"

Still locks up tight, both triggers cock when barrel is opened, and both barrels fire their firing pins- Very solid feeling and operating shotgun. I've never shot it. These took a 2&1/2"" standard sized 12 gauge shell I believe, but the powder or pressure was lighter back then. I don't believe a shotgun this age was designed for today's high pressure ammo. I would check it out thoroughly before using it and confirm what current ammo fits the original design pressure. Great vintage antique for the wall or to use with the correct 2&1/2"" shells.
