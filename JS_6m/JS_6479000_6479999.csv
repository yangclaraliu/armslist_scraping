This advanced operating system reduces carbon fouling, excessive heat and unburned powder in the action, ensuring reliability and function that is unmatched. A standard 5.56mm NATO chrome-lined chamber and bore ensure reliable function in any environment. Barrels feature an A2 flash suppressor and are threaded ½x28 TPI, allowing the SIG516 to adapt to a number of aftermarket accessories and suppressor mounts.

This is the Desert model MK25. This is one of those pistols that make you seem like a better shooter than you really are. The action is butter smooth and much of the recoil is taken up by the frame so you can be back on target faster. I've got three Sigs (1 other MK25 in Black) and will always be a Sig guy from now on.If you've been wantin one of these, but put it off because of the price, now's your time to get one under retail.Comes with the box, all paperwork, NSWG Certificate of Authenticity, pistol, and three 15 round magazines.Possible trade for something in 308/7.62"

I have a Ruger 22/45 that I built up. It started as a Ruger Mark II 22/45 frame. Which is the most comfortable and lightest of the 22/45 frames. From there I purchased a Tactical Solutions Pac-Lite 6"" receiver with adjustable fiber optic sights. Ruger ""Match ""bolt.  I added a Volqaurtsen accurizing 2.25 lb kit (Gen 1 wide faced trigger, trigger spring and plunger, sear, and stainless hammer.) I also have a TandemKross ""Victory"" flat faced trigger that comes with this gun. I added a Tactical Solutions ""Ruger Racker"" to help with racking the bolt. Lastly, I have a TandemKross ""Kanewolf"" slingshot mod kit. Not installed. It allows you to pull the bolt back and release it to chamber the first round just like most semi auto pistols. Gun is light, accurate, and a joy to shoot. The only reason I am selling this one is because I built two of them. One for me, and one for my now ex-wife.  Comes with one 10 rnd magazine. No box, this is not a production pistol, this is a custom frame up build. First 600$ takes it. Pix are on my phone, can text you them if interested. Must show Ohio ID."

This weapon has a Ruger ""Match ""bolt.  I added a Volqaurtsen accurizing 2.25 lb kit (Gen 1 wide faced trigger, trigger spring and plunger, sear, and stainless hammer.) I also have a TandemKross ""Victory"" flat faced trigger that comes with this gun. I added a Tactical Solutions ""Ruger Racker"" to help with racking the bolt. Lastly, I have a TandemKross ""Kanewolf"" slingshot mod kit. Not installed. It allows you to pull the bolt back and release it to chamber the first round just like most semi auto pistols. Gun is light, accurate, and a joy to shoot. The only reason I am selling this one is because I built two of them. One for me, and one for my now ex-wife.  Comes with one 10 rnd magazine.
