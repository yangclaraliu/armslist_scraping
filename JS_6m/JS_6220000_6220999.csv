LMT CQB MRP Piston 16"" heavy barrel, chrome lined -- *** I purchased as a complete rifle. Not bought as an upper/lower takeoff *** Monolithic, one-piece upper receiver. LMT SOPMOD. LMT A2 birdcage. LMT piston SA BCG
 
Built late 2015 (see tag in photo); purchased by me in October 2016.*** Original owner for all in photos. I have receipts for everything. All purchased from auth dealers ***
I purchased this (new) a couple of months ago from an authorized LMT dealer. I have not shot the LMT, only charged the weapon to check parts-function. I am on a bullpup-kick and have been buying AUGs, Tavors and PS90s. I am not much of an AR-guy and it is too front-heavy for my son to shoot. He much prefers the AUG and X95 Tavor. 
Everything that ships from LMT is included. I am the original owner. I am including some additional ""upgraded"" parts that I bought in the last two months for use with this AR:
AXTS/Radian Raptor charging handle with FDE ears (also includes LMT handle)
CTS Aktive anti-tilt buffer H2 weight (also includes LMT buffer)
Magpul polymer BUIS (includes LMT A-frame sights as shown)
Battle Arms Dev titanium Ion-bond black take-down pins (on rifle)
KNS Precision push-button take-down pins
KNS Precision non-rotation pins in FDE (not installed)
BCM QD end-plate
KAC quad-rail covers in black
LMT rail covers in FDE
LMT torque wrench
 
The Surefire M900LT light and Mepro MOR RDS/laser are not included. I will be willing to price them much better than street price if you're interested. Both items were bought from MidwayUSA (by me).
 
Roughly $400 in additional gear listed above. I paid $2200 for the standard rifle. I am looking for $1475 complete and you don't pay local sales tax. As stated; this is unfired.
 
You must be willing to sign a bill-of-sale and have a NV ID or CCW with you at the time of purchase. Located in S Reno near Montreux/Galena Forest.

The rifle is an Izhevsk manufactured in 1944. I bought it from Samco global before they went out of business and I payed somewhere around $225 or so, I can't remember exactly. This rifle is different from a standard Mosin in that it started life as a sniper variant. All of the sniper markings are still visible and the serial number for the scope that was on it can be found under the stock. The holes for the scope mount were filled, but the cutout in the stock where the mount goes is still there as well as the original bent bolt. All of this work was done by the military that fielded it. Bore is in good shape. I am selling this rifle so cheap because I need money for Christmas and I would like to get it sold as quickly and easily as possible. No haggling please."

Still fully functional. This mag carrier is made for right-handed shooters (magazines carried on your left side).The Glock magazines in the picture are NOT included. I'm not using it anymore because for a smaller guy like me, this mag carrier is very long and basically takes up my entire left side.

$800 in cash or better in trade.  I've seen other bright polished 686 models selling for a lot higher, so price is firm.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  Please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? this makes it a lot easier when considering.  If you ask if I'm interested in a firearm worth less and make no mention of adding cash or other to make up the difference, I will politely decline thinking you want a straight trade.
The only items I'm looking for right now is a Sig P320 Compact or Carry model in 9mm + $350 with std. sights or + $300 with night sights.  
Mostly interested in semi-autos(AR & AK rifles & pistols), but will consider others firearms, depending, stripped AR lowers, nice triggers, maybe other parts.  FosTech Echo trigger or the Franklin BFS, Gen 3 only.  
Springfield M1A SOCOM 16 or Scout 18"".
1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles.  Value needs to equal cash price, let me know the details.

It includes the following:- 8 Glock magazines (4x 10rnd, 4x 13rnd)- Leather (Bianchi) holster and mag holder- Kydex (Sidearmor) holster and mag holder- Original accessories (case, lock, manual, etc)- Copy of original receiptI feel like this is a very fair price, Glock magazines are $25 each and the Sidearmor holster sells for $60. The sights sell for around $100 but they are about 10 years old at this point so their value is decreased significantly.Contact me through Armslist or Text/Call my cell REDACTED."

Sights look great, finish is perfect, and overall a very solid feeling rifle.  Again brand new never fired in box. Bought before the election just in case Hillary won and these became impossible to buy. Check gunbroker, this exact model goes for up to $950! $750 is a very fair price and firm. Only trade would be for an Ak pistol in 7.62x39 such as a draco or zastava plus $150 or extras ammo etc. to make up price difference. Not looking to gouge on price, just make a fair trade. Willing to take 9mm or 12ga ammo also. Let me know. Thanks."

Its had about 300 rounds through it and it was built for CQB. A very nice build and not your normal Glock. I am not super motivated to sell it, as I have never shot a pistol with as good of a grouping or anywhere near the smoothness of this setup, basically looking for the guy that likes the nostalgia of the Austrian made Gen2 and knows what those upgrades cost so I will NOT take below asking price. yes I know you can get a brand new gen 4 for 550 but you add the 500 in Zev parts and you would be well over 1000 on the build."

Trigger is currently set close to two pounds.The following work was done by Short Action Customs:Thread the barrel, includes thread protectorBolt handle was replaced and moved forward for better extraction and Kampfeld Custom bolt knob installedInstalled their side bolt release kit and removed the factory bolt release buttonThe only things left to do are have the action trued and a custom barrel chambered and spun on, should you want to do that. Otherwise, it shoots well in its current state. I've just decided to have them build me a complete rifle on one of their custom actions, so I'm selling this one. Thanks for looking."
