I don't have any high-dollar gear, just a Lee hand loader, a couple 4-piece die sets (.40S&W and .256), .40S&W lead bullets and assorted tools like scale, powder measure, bullet puller, brass, primers, and even 2 unopened 4-pound bottles of RamShot True Blue pistol powder. I know there is more, but those are the major items. I genuinely believe this is a great setup for someone wanting to dip their toe in to reloading with minimal investment. Attached are a few pics of my reloading cabinet and I welcome any questions about what I have. Also, anyone in the area is welcome to stop by and take a detailed look at everything. The powder alone is worth well over $150 so everything else could be considered free! :)Thanks for looking."

I am the original and only owner of this safe queen, and it was always stored in a climate-controlled environment. Condition is unfired. There is a tiny finish nick on the trigger guard, and a few minor rub marks on the stock finish from storage in a safe in its early years. The bolt shows very light contact surfaces from typical insertion/removal. Butt pad condition is very good, and it is still pliant, with no cracking or deterioration, but there is some natural discoloration of the red-brown rubber typical of its age. The bolt face, chamber, throat, bore, and muzzle are all pristine. The bluing is absolutely superb on these rifles.Includes: Rifle, original box, manual, Stoeger import papers. I can't remember the exact year I purchased this, possibly 1987/88. These were, and likely still are, the best rifles in their class.$2,200 shipped from my FFL to your FFL.

Springfield Armory®, the same company that brought Point & Shoot Ergonomics™ to the market in 2001 is proud to announce the latest evolution of the polymer pistol – The XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact in 9mm and .40SW.
Put an XD® Mod.2® in your hand, and you’ll feel the difference. Equipped with the GripZone®, the XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand.
Enter the GripZone®: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone®, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose.
The GripZone® doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone® advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand.
If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact."

It's been stored in a moisture wicking sock for four years. 
The reason for the sale? I got married, and couldn't explain to my wife why I owned three of the same gun. 
These are GREAT guns. I modified one and made it a modern deer/tac rifle, and keeping a (more beat up) Mosin as a range toy. 
I got married last year, and unsuccessfully attempted to explain to my wife why I need three of the same gun, so it's time for this one to go. 
I hope to place it in a loving, pro 2A home :) 
(Note, the manufacturer isn't correct, because ArmsList does not include Mosin Nagant in their catagories)."

(*All NFA rules apply)A 30 caliber rifle the size of an AR15 5.56mm caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300 AAC Blackout uses ordinary 223/5.56mm  magazines for a full 30 round capacity, and is available in 12.5, and 16 inch barrels.Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower strength S7 more commonly used."

Finally, you can obtain a High End Quality handgun at a reasonable price. This gun was $1,500.00 not including Shipping and FFL fees. This is absolutely lowest I will go, so please don't ask. Lowballs will be ignored. The pictures don't do the actual gun justice. It must be seen and operated for its quality and function to be appreciated."

Looks amazing when pulling it out at the rangeLooking to sell everything for $2100At this price, the package is a deal. The rifle alone (when they can be found) has been found going for over $1k. Obviously, I don't expect ""brand new"" or ""gunbroker"" prices, hence my package deal being well below the total value. Would prefer selling, but to help out with the expense I can accept partial trades. IF YOU WANT ""MSRP"" OR BRAND NEW VALUE FOR YOUR TRADES, I WILL EXPECT THE SAME.

No cash from either party.2) Dan Wesson .357 mag (est. circa 1970-73) with a 6"" barrel and nothing else. It needs a pin on the cylinder release latch to keep it in place. It has wear and light pitting on the sleeve. It shoots perfect up to and past a 100 yards. I am activly searching for the part and thinking about just keeping it due to it's age and maker. It shoots fine now the latch comes out when the cylinder is dropped open for brass change.I am looking for semi auto pistols in .45 ACP, FDE color and that come with case and papers and a holster. Lower end 1911's XD, XDm, XDs, etc. I will look at all pistol offers but .22LR , .38 and other wheel guns.

I have an unconverted saiga with folding stock that I'm looking to trade but would consider selling for the right offer. It has bullet guide installed and accepts standard ak mags. also has picatinny handguard with angled grip. Depending on the trade or sale it comes with 5 mags (1-steel 40round, 4-tapco style 30 round) mainly looking to trade for either an ak with under folder or ak pistol (m92 or the m85 that accepts ar15 mags from zastava) or other ak variant pistols. Might also consider other trades if cash is added i.e. 9mm, 40 cal, glock, mac 9/10/11 chambered in 9mm with mags and ammo. Mags will not be included if trading for 7.62x39 ak rifle or pistol since it accepts the same. If interested send an email and let's see what we can work out. Serious inquiries only please"

This lowered the trigger pull weight from 10lbs + to 4.5 - 5 lbs. These springs also smoothed out and shortened the trigger pull. Feels a lot better than it came from the factory. I will include the factory springs if you want to reinstall them.Includes one Magpul 30 round PMag & one 30 round metal magazine.Also included, but not yet installed, is a Troy Ambidextrous Bolt Release. This is just like the Magpul BAD lever, but Troy's is made of metal. About 1,000 rds through the rifle. No jams, no scratches etc, works great. Pretty minor wear on bcg.
