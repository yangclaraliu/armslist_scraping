This particular rifle is missing the front sight, I was debating buying one (~ $20) or just modifying it for a scope mount but it's your call. Stock is in decent condition, some slight nicks but with some stain and finish it would look nice again. This Mosin is definitely not a show piece or safe queen, but would be a great shooter for a range day and with some tweaks would be a nice addition. Asking $225 OBO, would consider trades for a CCW pistol, 1911, or others with cash on my end if needed. I have a few boxes (80 rounds or so) of 7.62x54r to include with the sale."

Calico still makes guns, but they do not make this version any longer i think it was too expensive to manufacture, the quad rail is high quality and solid. the spent casings fall out the bottom from a hole, you can add a bag to catch them.This is the rarest gun in my collection."

There is a very small and purely cosmetic crack in the forstock (see picture) that is you would probably have a hard time noticing if you were not looking specifically for it, but want to make sure any potential buyers are aware. It has zero impact on the normal operations of the shotgun and I've tried to price with this in mind. Great gun for someone looking to have a reliable, good looking sporting shotgun as their primary or backup. Comes with 2 chokes and original gun case. Seriously, I would hold onto this gun except I think it's a shame it sits unused. Hopefully someone else can continue to put it to good use. Frame has beautiful engraving that really makes this gun look as good as many of my other shotguns that were 2-3 times this price.

This is a 10.5"" AR pistol chambered in 7.62x39 and operated by an Adams Arms carbine-length piston kit. The goal of this project was an effective personal defense weapon that would be inexpensive, reliable, and fun to shoot.. It cycles cheap steel case ammo reliably and is SBR and suppressor-ready.

I like it, and it harkens back to the Soviet plum furniture for me... but it might not appeal to everybody.
If you've done your internet sleuthing on these, you will want to know if this gun cycles 7.62 reliably... the answer is yes. Here's a video I took of a function test of three consecutive magazines. Note that the BCG is basically clean after 90 rounds:

My supplier gave me a super bargain price on these great polymer frame conceal carry pistols, so here they go. I actually own this same firearm. Very good quality, and American made. Have them in also in pink. This is a compact conceal carry pistol, with 2 -10 rd double stacked mags. Very reliable and fun to shoot.  With the CPX2 model, the long trigger pull is the ""safety"" .   Well designed, with not much to get snagged on.  The only downside is that the mags are very stiff when new, but they losen up.  Until they breakin, without a loader, you will likely only be able to get 8 rounds in.  It will likely take you a while to get used to the long, but smooth trigger pull, but you will.  As a dealer, I have the ability to own pretty much any firearm, and this is the one I pick for conceal carry.  The pics are stock and are for illustrative purposes only. Covered by SCCY's lifetime warranty.   My prices are firm and reasonable.  Barrel: machined from bar stock with 7 lands and grooves having a 16‐1 right hand twist. Receiver: 7075‐T6 aircraft grade heat treated aluminum alloy, machined from bar stock. Grip/Frame: Made from Zytel polymer, with ergonomic finger grooves and an integral “RE-COIL CUSHION” on the back‐strap. Recoil Spring System: all steel, fully encapsulated for ease of disassembly and reassembly. Slide Lock/Release: steel with a Zytel over molded polymer extension for ease of operation. 3 dot sight system: steel rear sight, adjustable for windage only with locking screw. Hammer firing system: double action only, internal hammer with inertial firing pin to prevent accidental discharge if dropped. Double action trigger: specifically designed for shooter comfort and accuracy by designing the system to have a smooth effortless, consistent 9 pound trigger pull. Magazine: included with (2) double stack, 10 round capacity magazines with finger extension base installed and 2 flat magazine bases included. Trigger Guard Lock: custom designed to properly fit and be child resistant. Includes 2 keys.
