Pistol is in mint condition, 25-50  rounds fired. Original box is included with everything that came with a new gun. One 5 round mag and one 6 round with grip extension.
As far as the value; that’s up to you. This pistol is $706.58 today from Buds. Use that information however you like in determining a trade value or cash price.
This pistol is in absolutely perfect condition; just like new. I’m just ready to trade some guns. Here is what I’m interested in…
Smith & Wesson K or L frame revolvers in .357Mag. 686, 19, 66, etc. Not really interested in J-frames unless it’s a stainless .357Mag.
PCP Air Rifles. I been kicking this idea around. But if you offer a trade it has to include a set-up ready to shoot, so it must include a pump or bottle.
Micro pistols… maybe if you have something interesting. I’d like to stay away from .380 but haven’t ruled them out.
Not interested in Black Powder, Pump shotguns, archery, or anything in rough condition.
Money can go either way. If we trade firearms I require ID showing you are a Tennessee Resident 21 or over and a signed bill of sale (I will provide). I’m in the Murfreesboro/Shelbyville area.
I have a Mossberg MVP Varmint up for trade also and will be adding an S&W M&P40C Leo version, both in mint condition, as soon as I get the pics and descriptions together."

There is a fair share of information on the internet so I'm only going to mention that its all aluminum so you will never have to be concerned about rust like you would with the 870's and other shotguns. This shotgun does have a couple problems. The inertia block and spring are missing and the is a small crack at the back of the stock due to over tightening. The browning double auto has the same inertia system so you can purchase the parts from that gun for this gun. Numrichs has all the parts available at the time im listing this. All the parts add up to under $50. As for the crack in the stock, the stock is plastic so basic epoxy will repair it."

The Baby Desert Eagle pistol is available in either a steel frame or a polymer frame with a black finish. The steel frames and slides are produced from high quality carbon steel with an attractive matte black oxide finish. Full size and semi-compact models feature a tactical rail for optional lasers and/or flashlights.

The gun is in excellent condition. It's spent  most of its life hanging in a display case. It's only been fired a couple times and it's been kept perfectly clean. My grandfather collected guns and when he passed away he left a few of them to me. I'm planning on moving abroad soon so I can't take it with me. I'm asking $200 for it. This gun is in great shape and I would venture to say it's even better than new. My grandfather did quite a bit of gunsmithing and it looks like this pistol has been given a very nice polishing. The trigger and action are very smooth.

I'm a Glock guy.It comes with 2 magazines (one 6-round, one 7-round with finger extension), case, manual, Sig holster, and all orignal accessories. It has TFO Tritium Fiber Optic front night night and Tritium rear night sight. I had a Crimson Trace trigger guard laser on it, so the foam in the case is cut slightly to accomodate the laser. The laser has been sold and is not included in this sale, but I wanted to mention it because of the foam. The pistol is still held firmly in place by the foam, even without the laser installed.Sale is cash-only. No trades. Local sales only and MUST go through FFL (buyer pays fee). Please do not contact me if you're not willing to do an FFL transfer.Thanks!"
