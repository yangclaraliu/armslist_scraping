The UPUR-1 is machined on a 5 Axis machining Center to reduce the number of operations/setups required to complete. This machining process allows the highest possible accuracy to be obtained over the traditional 3 or 4 Axis machining method. The UPUR-1 is designed for increased function, performance & to provide an advanced modern appearance & feel to the AR15 platform weapon system.

The Sig holster (not pictured) is actually very sturdy and holds the gun well. Light not included, but will fit gun with Sig light/laser combo or TLR-2, possibly other brands as well. There is a tensioning screw that adjusts the hold on the pistol.This one has the E2 grips, short reset trigger, and bright factory night sights. Gun has some light carry marks, but no deep scratches or dings in the surface finish of the slide. The rail has some wear from having flashlights attached in th past. This is a great shooter and I cannot recall EVER having a malfunction with it.

I like it because you get near semi auto capacity without worrying about killing magazine springs or leaving it ""cocked and locked"". 8 shots always ready to go with no chance of jamming or malfunctions. This gun has probably been shot at range around 100 times and is very comfortable even with .357 ammo due to the ported barrel. From the shooter's perspective, the gun really isn't any louder than normal, unlike most other ported guns. I am the original owner and this gun has been well cared for and has been in a safe the vast majority of it's life. Soe minor handling marks, but no deep scratches or dings in the finish.I've decided to part with some of my collection that isn't getting any use and luckily for you, this is one of them.

Even if you aren't interested in buying it, the pictures are worth looking at and that is free ;-)Designed to be small and compact for easy carry conceal or small storage areas, this Model 36 J-frame has a pinned 1.875 inch (sometimes called a 2 inch) barrel. It has 5-round capacity in a swing-out cylinder, case-hardened trigger, and case-hardened exposed hammer with single or double action. This gun has a grooved rear sight and a ramped fixed blade front sight. It features a bright shiny nickel finish and has Smith & Wesson wood grips.This thirty-two year old classic revolver is in beautiful condition. The original owner fired three cylinder's worth of rounds before storing it. I took it to the range after I bought it and fired thirty-five factory-manufactured rounds through it, keeping the total of the rounds fired through this gun at fifty.As with all of the S&W revolvers I have had the pleasure to shoot, this one is an accurate and fun gun. While this gun is pretty enough to just put up somewhere and admire, it is dependable and accurate enough to carry conceal or use as a house gun.There are a few very small light surface spots on this revolver from time in careful storage over the past more than three decades, but I am not sure any of them even show up in the non-retouched pictures. The location of the spots are mainly at the bottom of the revolver by the serial number. Please contact me for several additional pictures.Before you go any further, please verify that you meet the following conditions and are willing and able to provide verifiable contact information in your initial correspondence.I have received many inquiries, some offers, and a couple of ""I'll take it"" emails recently from folks who have not met and verified the following criteria or weren't able to buy right now, which have prevented sales to legitimate would-be purchasers.""Able to complete at this time a local face-to-face cash sale. Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID. No exceptions."""
