Shoots 1/3 MOA with 175 gr match ammo. This rifle is in excellent condition with no wear, or flaws.
Rifle: Savage 10 FCP-K with 24” heavy profile, 1/10 twist, free float, fluted, threaded barrel, and muzzle break. Accustock, accutrigger (modified with solid trigger stop and lighter spring…breaks at 10 oz…can be returned to factory pull weight in a couple minutes by reinstalling included factory trigger spring), harris bipod, 10 rd box mag.Scope: Meopro 4-12x50 with weaver 20 MOA base and rings. Research this scope…the clarity is ridiculous (99.8% light transmittance) and the turret adjustments are perfectly accurate and repeatable. My friend has a $2500 nightforce, and when looking at his neighbors cows through it at dusk or dawn, you could only make out outlines and silhouettes…with the Meopro, you could actually see individual hairs on the cow’s hide.Will include 1 box of Federal 175gr gold medal match sierra match king BTHP, along with ballistic data for this specific rifle/scope/ammo combination (measured with ballistic software hooked to chronograph, taking into account bullet weight, velocity, barrel twist, and scope height in relation to bore) Provides precise MOA adjustments for range and windage in 50 yrd increments out to 1100 yds. You can drive tacks at any distance the first time out.
I have @$1600 into this but have switched to a 6.5 creedmoor set up. This is a great opportunity to pick up a 1000 yd rifle for a very reasonable price.
$890…There is a little wiggle room on price, but not much...no trades (except handguns in 9mm or 45, and in my favor)…face to face only…no shipping…all laws apply"

Only ~150 rounds have been fired through this fine 1911. It is a handsome firearm, recent, and without that ostentatious large white banner across the slide that came with older versions of this .45. The gun is off-roster and can no longer be FFL sold or transferred new here in California. You might want to get it while the getting is good via PPT. You will seldom see a used one such as this in such great shape! Gun has all the bells and whistles and especially suits lefties like myself very well due to the ambidextrous thumb safety.Only selling to help fund some rifle projects.The firearm is in excellent+ cosmetic and mechanical condition. Comes with six (6) as-new magazines! One (1) OEM 8-round Armscor/ACT magazine, three (3) as-new 7-rd Brownell's magazines, two (2) as-new Mec-Gar 10-rd magazines. The OEM and Brownell's magazines have proven to be very reliable in the firearm. Also included will be the new VZ Alien Grips as depicted. These are really cool and cost me over $75.00, VZ grips did not come with this firearm.  Grips have the specially ordered 'RIA ambi-cut' that fit the gun perfectly and include the optional Super Scoop. Also included as part of this sale will be the original RIA rubber, and also the later, more attractive styled wood grips for a total of three (3) sets of dedicated grips.I'm also throwing in an unopened Wilson Combat Complete Spring Set that contains every spring needed to complete or upgrade the pistol:  P10G18 - Spring, Recoil, Govt., 18 1/2#  P26 – Extra Power Firing Pin Spring  P27 – Reduced Power Hammer Spring 18#  R15A – Mag Catch Spring  R29 – Sear Spring  R33PS – Plunger Tube SpringFirearm also comes in its original hard plastic lockable case with owner's manual.Price: $649, you may deduct $60 from the selling price if you are not interested in the VZ's. I have 100% positive feedback on ebay with over 850 transactions over the years, 100% iTrader feedback on calguns (47 transactions) and 100% on gunbroker and ar15dotcom. Inquire within. LOCAL PPT ONLY. Buyer shall pay all fees, which should amount to $35 plus lock fee, but I will 'sell' you a DOJ approved lock and provide you with a receipt which should pass muster with the FFL.

Please be sure that you have all required documents and FSC or unexpired HSC, and that you are not a prohibited person. If DROS does not go through the system successfully and I am forced to take the gun back you agree to incur a cancellation charge of 20% of the sale price, so please be sure that you will pass your background check, etc.  Sorry, but I am not interested in trades. You won't be disappointed in this great pistol! Buy it while it's still available!"

I realize that I'm not going to get that out of it becasue it is a custom rifle. So I'd like to give someone a really good deal on this rifle. As long as you can make me an offer that is above what the pawn shop would give me, we can talk about the price. I only have about 300 rounds through the gun.I have a brand new $250 Sig Sauer red dot that I would sell with the rifle for the right price."

Long considered the premier compact handgun, you can't beat the size/weight/capacity of Americas favorite Glock.  It has only 200 rounds through it with no failures or malfunctions. I've only carried it a few times, so holster wear is non existent, the finish is clean and it looks new. Everything is 100% stock although I did add a talon grip for a better grip. Gen 3 Glocks are notoriously slippery. The Glock comes with 2 15 round mags and the box with its original contents. NO TRADES. I am firm on price but I can barter down a bit if you've got Glock 43 magazines/accessories. I can provide 17 round Glock mags at an additional $20 a piece or trade a few for Glock 43 magazines. Give me me a call or text at REDACTED or reply via email. I can send more pics through text or email."

The G43 is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It is ultra-concealable, accurate, and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built-in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other Glock pistols.$395"

She has been socialized from an early age and is great around people and animals alike. She is pretty well house broken, but still has occasional accidents. It breaks my heart to get rid of her, but she needs someone to spend more time with her than I can at this time. I paid $1500 for her and had to make the 10.5 hour drive to pick her up. Howling Hills is in the top 3 true mid-high content breeders out there. They are not your typical backyard wolf dog operation. She will come with a large kennel, dog food, her favorite toys, adoption paper, and a collar. She is a very loving, sweet, and loyal animal. Picture 3 is of her dad."

The SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect the shooter's strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip.

Fulcrum Ultimate Trigger Kit. That said your also going to get the orginal glock case, the glock bag, the fobus IWBM, a cheap leather holster. You'll also get the 2 glock clips and about 270ish rounds of ammo.. plus whats in the clips.. (self defense rounds). The gun shoots awesome.
