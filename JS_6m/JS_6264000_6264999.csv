Experience one of the most innovative developments in modern firearms technology with the patented KRISS Vector Platform. At the heart of each Vector is the Super V Recoil Mitigation System. This unique operating system redirects energy down, and away from the shooter, which eliminates felt recoil and muzzle climb. The KRISS Vector GEN II is the next evolution of the Vector platform, taking it from a firearm into a multi-caliber weapon system. Chambered in .45ACP and 9mm, the KRISS Vector is compatible with the ubiquitous Glock magazine. Changing between calibers can be done in seconds, without any tools. The KRISS Vector GEN II is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip. The KRISS Vector CRB is the non-NFA, semi-automatic, carbine variant with a 16” barrel. The DEFIANCE KRISS Stock provides a wide range of adjustment and length of pull. Additional standard equipment on the KRISS Vector CRB are the flip sights, full length picatinny top rail, lower picatinny accessory rail, and a Glock magazine. The CRB is civilian legal with compliant models available for most states.

Most people have never fired an AR with this quality trigger.I have shot 4 F-class, 600 yard matches with the rifle.  My best score was 552/600.  I know it was me and not the rifle keeping the scores from going higher.  The fact is, gas guns are hard on brass and I DO NOT enjoy prepping brass as often as required.  Ar-10's are not like AR-15's.  There are 3 standards for take down pin diamters and barrell nuts aren't standard.  Having one already firing correctly is a huge savings in time and research.I will deducted $180 and keep the trigger group if that is desireable.Parts alone will run $1750 for this exact setup."

Kimber builds some of the world's finest pistols, right here in America--- something that makes sense as few things are as American as the 1911. The venerable 1911, on its own merit, is an engineering masterpiece. The simple fact that shooters still marvel today over a design that is over 100-years-old speaks volumes about the gun that has stood the test of time. Virtually every critical component on each pistol is manufactured inside the Kimber factory. Only the finest raw materials come through the front gate, and Kimber takes care of the rest. This ensures every component meets unequaled standards. The Kimber Ultra Carry II is a 3"" barrel 9mm 1911 paired with a compact frame with stainless finish, and a brush polished black slide. Kimber workmanship and quality are easy to see, even down to the smallest detail. The melded forged stainless steel slide and lightweight aluminum alloy frame fit together with tight tolerances and function perfectly. Recoil on the Kimber Ultra Carry II feels significantly less than that of competing designs. This is due in part to this pistol’s lower center of gravity, which is slightly below the slide, and very close to where the shooter's hand grips the gun. Although the single-stack magazine puts the Kimber's capacity at only eight rounds, the relatively small diameter of the 1911's frame still allow the shooter to create a secure two-handed grip. A match grade barrel and bushing deliver tack driving accuracy. For added reliability, Kimber includes a full- length guide rod, as the shorter G.I. style guide rods have a tendency to bind or break over time. Snag-free, low profile front and rear combat sights sit on top of the slide and provide a consistent target presentation. The checkering on the mainspring housing and the partial checkering of the wood grip feels secure.The knurled extended magazine release of the Kimber Ultra Carry II is a huge improvement over releases seen on other pistols. Performing tactical reloads is quick, simple and efficient. The Kimber Ultra Carry II single stage, match grade aluminum trigger is a joy to pull, especially over the mushy triggers seen on most double action pistols. The 4 – 5 lbs pull is steady and smooth, while the reset is short and crisp. This is a gun that fires naturally, even for beginner's that have “low and left” trigger slap tendencies. In fact, the Kimber Ultra Carry II has one of the smoothest trigger pulls of any production1911 on the market. Other features include a clean, single sided thumb safety. Many shooters actually prefer this style over the bulkier ambidextrous paddles. To further minimize felt recoil, the grip safety is a high-ride designed beavertail that quickly establishes a positive grip for maximum control in stress fire situations. For service and repair, the pistol is backed by a manufacturers 1- year warranty. Overall, the Kimber Ultra Carry II Two Tone in 9mm is a lightweight, low recoil 1911 that is accurate, well-built and engineered for years of reliable service."

Chambered for the .22LR cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken! Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver."

Built on the G30 SF frame, the G30S combines the full capacity .45 ACP round count with a slimmer slide. This pistol offers a lighter, more easily concealable option for law enforcement and legal concealed-carry enthusiasts.SPECSModel 30SType HandgunAction Semi-AutoAction Type Striker FiredCaliber .45 ACPBarrel Length 3.77""Weight 22.95 oz.Sights White Dot/White OutlineFinish Blackened Stainless/PolymerGrips PolymerCapacity 2 x 10-Round MagazinesWhat you see here is a Glock 30S, a new version of the Model 30 that offers a slightly smaller grip (based on the Glock 30SF) and a thinner slide than the previous iteration. Despite the smaller dimensions, the magazines hold 10 rounds each; the gun is known for its excellent accuracy and reliability. So we have a concealable, accurate, reliable semi-automatic pistol that, with two magazines, potentially allows a licensed concealed pistol carrier to have 21 rounds of .45 Auto available (assuming a 10+1 setup and one additional magazine with all 10 rounds loaded.) Perfection!With the Glock name comes durability, reliability, and simplicity. This is the brand that most law enforcement officers carry. For the Model 30S, this is the gun that carries 10 rounds of .45 Auto. So with a $657 retail price, you also get what many consider is one of the best values out there.You must be 100% legal and have docs."

These KS-47s are basically an AR platform that is chambered in 7.62x39, and accepts any AK magazine. Way cheaper to shoot than firing 5.56 or 223, plus much more punch! If you're unfamiliar with these rifles, check out the video on youtube (PSA KS47 -vs- CMMG Mutant).The Palmetto State Armory KS47 is based on the AR15, and combines the modular construction, accuracy and precision of the AR platform with the stopping power and the magazine options of the AK. While the current AR47 fires the 7.62x39 AK round, it uses modified AR-style magazines that are not nearly as plentiful as AK-style magazines, that were optimized for reliable feeding of the 7.62x39 round. The KS47 lets the AK shooter capitalize on his inventory of magazines and ammo with an AR-style platform. Unlike the AK, where the barrel is permanently pressed into the receiver, the KS47 features an AR-style modular configuration which consists of a barreled upper receiver, and a lower receiver that houses the fire control group and magazine. The modular configuration allows customers to have several different barrel configurations with one lower receiver, just by releasing two pins. Lower: The 7075-T6 billet lower receiver is hardcoat anodized, and accepts standard AR15 fire control groups. The extended magazine release is outside of the trigger guard for safety, which allows for an AK-style release movement, but also features oversize side paddles for fingertip release by the trigger finger. Fitted with a Ergo grip and M4-style stock, the receiver also features a standard, mil-spec diameter, 6 position, 7075 carbine buffer tube. The KS47 lower has steel reinforcements to accept AK style surplus magazines including drum-style.Upper: The KS47 hybrid upper receiver is precision machined out of billet 7075 T6 aluminum, and then hardcoat anodized for durability. While retaining the look of a standard M4 upper, the KS47 hybrid upper is designed to work with either the KS47 lower, or the standard AR47 lower. The chrome moly vanadium barrel is chambered in 7.62x39 with a 1 in 10 twist, has M4-style feed ramps, is nitride treated for accuracy and durability, and is finished off with a 5/8-24 thread A2-style compensator. The forward, assist, dust cover, charging handle, and safety are all standard AR15, as is the PSA Slim free-float rail and barrel nut.BCG: The hybrid KS47 Bolt carrier group works with either AK47 magazines or AR47 magazines, and features an extended firing pin. The carrier is made of 8620 steel, chrome lined and phosphate coated, and the chrome lined gas key is attached with grade 8 bolts and properly staked. The Bolt is made of phosphate coated 9310 steel. The KS47 Upper and Hybrid BCG are compatible with standard AR15 lowers for use with AR47-style magazines.I'm asking $900 for the rifle with one steel or PMAG 30 round magazine (buyers choice).   *** Drum magazine in pics is not include with this sell, at this price."
