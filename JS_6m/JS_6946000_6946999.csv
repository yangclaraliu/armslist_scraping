These staves may be bent by the wearer to conform to the curve of the back. They also may be removed and used for bone-setting splints.The unique suspension system contains two M720 series 60MM rounds and transfers a wearer's weight to the hips via the internal frame system.

When I purchased this used from a pawn shop, the grips were spray-painted an ugly matte black. I sanded them and refinished them to look factory again. Because it was altered before my purchase I'm selling it far below it's store value. All mechanical components work properly and reliably.This is a fun gun for the shooting range. It's heavy enough that the recoil is nearly nonexistent. It's  single action, requiring the hammer to be cocked before each shot. Please do not consider this gun for any form of self defense. Included is the additional .22 magnum cylinder and trigger lock. This firearm requires a valid and up to date concealed carry permit to purchase. No ammo for sale with this firearm."
