The gun was test fired once to ensure function and then never fired since. The gun comes with two 8-round magazines which are kept in the butt-stock of the rifle along with its barrel and upper receiver. The gun assembles in seconds and fires .22 LR in a semi-automatic fashion until the 8-round mag has expired. The gun comes with a hunter orange vertal front sight and a rear sight peephole, very accurate upon assembly. The gun features a picatinny rail on the top of its receiver for mounting aftermarket sighting systems, which are numerous. When disassembled, the barrel, stock, and magazines, all fit inside of a waterproof compartment in the rifle's stock, which can be then shoved in a backpack or slung over the shoulder, weighing in at only 3.5 lbs, the lightest semi-automatic .22 LR ever created. This gun is an incredibly useful item; I bought a few of them when they first entered market, and I am getting rid of a few now to help pay for other projects. The rifle was bought brand new at $350.00 (before tax), the same price it is currently selling at ($60.00 more expensive than the matte-black version). I may be somewhat flexible on the price, just email me and we'll parley. This gun is a great gift idea for anyone looking for a super lightweight .22 that is easy to shoot and practical to carry, perfect for bugout bags or even for extended outings to the woods as a take-down rifle that takes up little space."

J. Fuller Collection last year. This is an early 1969 Smith & Wesson Model 10-5 .38 Special M&P (Military & Police) six-shot shot revolver. It has a square butt richly blued original finish K frame with a 4” tapered and pinned barrel. Dark rich S&W checkered walnut square-butt Magna grips with S&W medallions and serial numbers that match the frame complement this gorgeous gun. This revolver has a serrated ramp fixed front sight and a notched rear sight with the traditional sighting channel along the top of the gun. Very nice case hardened hammer and trigger with a clean and brilliantly shiny bore and cylinders. This beautiful revolver has light and smooth show holster wear at the sides of the very tip of the muzzle. There are a very few light freckles on the grip straps and a tiny handling mark at the right side of the top of the frame, but none of these time-expected items take away from the beauty or integrity of this S&W revolver. While the stunning looks of this gun first attracted me to it, the buttery-smooth trigger and pin-point accuracy after firing it made this revolver the epitome of the marriage of form and function. I have fired 30 problem-free rounds of factory .38 Special 130 grain factory ammunition through it since I acquired it. While I have never had a bad shooting or feeling Smith & Wesson revolver, the Model 10 line has consistently provided the finest trigger pulls and shooting accuracy for me. As mentioned above, the gun featured here is one of the premier Smith & Wesson revolvers that were sold from the Dr. C. J. Fuller Collection. Comes safely nested inside a new Bore Stores Silicone Treated Gun Storage rug. Before you go any further, please verify that you meet the following conditions and are willing and able to provide verifiable contact information in your initial correspondence. I have received many inquiries, some offers, and a couple of ""I'll take it"" emails from folks who did not meet or were not able to verify the following criteria or weren't able to buy right now. This has prevented sales to legitimate would-be purchasers. ""Able to complete at this time a local face-to-face cash sale.

Red fiber optic is in great shape and a spare red and green are also included. The barrel and factory-polished feed ramp are in like-new condition. The frame and slide are also excellent, I cannot find a single scratch. Will negotiate FFL transfer location. Pics: http://imgur.com/a/HkSrG"

I have too many projects and other pressing needs.Complete old style LC Smith frame from 1909, semi rust blued finish, and a stock that fits it, but not the factory barrel. The barrel that follows that fits the newer model frame is somewhat fit to this receiver, but would need a little more work if you want to use this combo. The parts for this frame are compete except for a missing trigger spring (which can be found), and it may need one new hammer spring, which there are many of. This is a 12ga frame, regular size, OE grade but without ejector hardware.Incomplete new style frame from 1928, that someone nickel plated, with the factory barrel, but no stock. The stock from the other one is factory original and is not cracked behind the sidelock plates, is currently unfinished, and could possible be modified to fit the newer frame. LC Smith stocks are not plentiful, nor cheap, and if you freshened up the checkering and refinished it correctly, it would make a nice example. The factory buttplate for the stock is included. This frame has the trigger plate, side plates, top lever, main frame screws. The hammers, sears, and other internals could be moved to this frame from the other. This is a 12ga frame, regular size.The barrel is excellent. It's been reblued, but nicely done. The bores are excellent. 30"" with Full/Full fixed chokes. I do not know if it was hot blued or slow rust blued. The barrel is solid with no rattles, and rings true. A barrel like this could be sold on it's own for $200 and up.The forend iron is complete and all of the parts and screws for it. The forend wood has a nut made for a screw to mate with. This is an old repair someone made. You could plug the hole, finish the wood to match, fix the checkering, and you'd be all set.If you've got some time, you could build a decent LC Smith 12ga shooter out of all this, and then sell off the left-over parts and make some money back.$200 for all of it. Face-to-face sale around Raleigh/Durham NC or closeby, with a bill of sale."

I can confirm, 100% that this stock will also work on an AR-15. It uses a standard, rifle length buffer tube (included). This rifle is great for prone shooting. It adds a bit of weight, which helps tame recoil, and it is completely solid, with no wobble. One unexpected benefit, when I used it, was that it doesn't pull out beard hairs when shooting, like the standard collapsable stock was. It's a good product, in like new condition. You get everything that comes with it new, except the box and the Magpul sticker. No trades, please."

I haven’t fired this gun and my wife bought it brand new. The scope works well, on the .223 I have shot it out to 420 yards with the BDC reticle on max magnification though I have noticed quite a bit of parallax at that distance.

Rifle has seen 250 rounds. I have replaced the factory stock and added a DPMS factory quad rail- approx $250 in upgrades. The rifle is sold as is upon your inspection and DOES NOT INCLUDE THE OPTIC SHOWN. The rifle comes with both stocks, the lock and paper work shown. I am nothing short of anal in maintaining my firearms. There are no carbon depsits in the lower reciever and all parts are clean as I can get them- I even use q-tips in my cleaning prceedures. Barrel is chrome lined. I am interested in the selling the firearm as it is currently taking up space in my safe. I have not shot it in two years. I'm interested in liquidating firearms I no longer shoot to free up sapce in my safe. The last time I took it to the range, the firing pin retatining pin snapped and caused a jam. A highly trusted gunsmith inspected the rifle and determined weakness in the firing pin retaining pin to be the cause of failure. I have replaced this part, but as I have said, I have not fired the rifle since, as I bought a Sig556 shortly afterword. For this reason, I'm interested in selling the rifle in as is condition, and will require you to inspect the rifle upon purchase. Once sold, I hold no responsiblity for the Rifle, as with any purchase on armslist. Purchase must be completed face to face, CASH ONLY (NO TRADES),  through my FFL, who has already agreed to complete the transfer: NO EXCEPTIONS. This is not only compliant with state law, but is also for the sake of my own conscience- this term is non-negotaible. Price is for the rifle only, no magazines and NO OPTIC and is $350. This is about $200 cheaper than new DPMS's and has an upgraded rail and Magpul stock. At $350, this is still very reasonable for a parts gun- the barell has 250 rounds through it and a new DPMS barrel is just over $200. Consiter the upgraded parts as well as the upper and lower reciever and $350 is a fair price, to which I will not negoatiate. My FFL does charge a fee of $40 plus $6 for the background check. This $46 is in ADDITION to the $350 price. This makes the price out the door $396- I have had people try to sell me on $350 out the door to cut out the FFL, this will not happen so do not ask.   I am interested in selling, so please, only serious offers/ intrest inquires. I have had 34 people contact me (as of  2/20) and then not respond back or keep putting me off... if you see this ad the rifle is still for sale as I will responsibly remove the add once cash is in hand. It is first come first serve- I'm open to all buyers until Rifle is gone and the ad is removed. The first person to set up a meet on a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday between 4:00 and 5:30 gets the rifle. There is some flexability. My FFL is closed Sundays and Mondays. He does take appointments on Tuesdays and Wednesdays until 5-5:30 PM. He is open Thursday and Fridays until 6 PM and Saturdays until 3 pm. He is located in Wheat Ridge so be prepaired to meet there."

Has only had 350 rounds down the pipe all brass (blazer brass bulk pack I got on sale and was done all in one range session) I have the original box with all stickers and even the lube pack from sig along with the legion box with challenge coin. I have a bianchi owb leather holster which rides nice and high on the hip. Also I have 4 Mecgar +2 mags which make the gun 17+1 and Mecgar is the OEM manufacturer of all sig mags anyways. Does show a little bit of carry wear but this weapon is in perfect firing order. Also have an Inforce APL which I can include in the offer I just got for Christmas and the light has never been carried on the gun due to me not ordering a holster for it yet. I do love this firearm and have no real desire to get rid of it except I am interested in what is out there for trades. Must be of equal value of my firearm to trade. Willing to accept multiple handguns or handgun plus cash. I would prefer 9mm but if I trade into a different caliber I also have 50 rounds of Winchester Ranger T's 147gr. +P hollow points I can throw in as well.Price breakdown of what I have at prices I paid for it (I know that I will not recoup all of the money)Sig -$1200Mecgar extended mags (x4)-$140 @ 35ea.Holster-$59.99 from gander (a bit expensive for it but I got it from gander because I needed a holster that was in stock at the time)Inforce apl-$115 after shippingWould say the whole package is worth about $1350If you are interested in purchasing this package with cash I will let it go for 1200 everything except light and 1300 with lightMainly looking for trades please no 1911's unless they are railed.

My best friend hit tough times and pawned this item in order to make ends meet, was unable to make all payments and certainly, the item was sold. This is a good guy I'm trying to help out, a man who has fought for our country, is still finding his changed life after his tours overseas (please forgive if not worded in the best way), and it is things like this that I would love to keep off of the regret/frustration list. Please do not contact/reply to lecture about him pawning the item -- bills are bills and sometimes, there are more of those than money coming in, and I will sooner respect giving up a possession to take care of necessities. At the same time, I have never seen someone make such tremendous strides in such a short period of time on their own, that I would love to be able to return this piece home to him as it has been in his family for so long, and it would be an honor to do so. Some details from the original sale listing are below:Features: Type: Over and Under Shotgun Caliber/Gauge: 12GA (2 3/4"" Shells) Barrel Length: 26"" Sights: Fiber Optic Sight Capacity: 2 RDS Choke: Fixed - IM over MOD Stock/Grips: Gloss Walnut Stock Just over 13"" Length of Pull for Ladies or Youth This piece has tremendous sentimental value to he and his family, and I am desperately searching for the person who purchased it, in order to see if they would be willing to sell/trade. If you yourself, or if you know someone who purchased a Beretta BL-3, please contact me. I would love to speak to you, discuss the specific details to ensure it is in fact the same item, and will absolutely offer a finders fee to anyone who can help me track this down."

It doesn't get any better in terms of value for a full size high capacity 9mm for defense.  And even though it's classified as full size it still weighs in under 23 oz.  It will fit if you have big hands, yet is so light that anyone who is comfortable firing 9mm (not a high bar in defensive calibers) will still find it easy to handle the pistol.  S&W means reliability and craftsmanship and their entry level is better than the mid-level or higher for some others.  A good example is that polishing internal metal parts is a minimum 2 year apprenticeship at S&W.  That speaks strongly both directly and indirectly to why their semi-autos are so reliable.  (And why so many other ""manufacturers"" buy their parts from S&W)I always talk to such nice and knowledgeable people on armslist that it almost seems to go without saying, but just in case, all transfers must be done legally.  Please research and ask questions if you don't already know the relevant legal requirements."
