172,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6092172,For Sale:  ** Best Length Short AR15 that you can own! **,"30 Minutes West of Jacksonville, Jacksonville, Florida",$ 500,"Listed On: Wednesday, November 9, 2016",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"This is an AR-15 with a 11.5"" premium palmetto state complete upper ( besides a charging handle ) chambered in 5.56 NATO with a 1:7 twist rate. It features a .750 gas port and a carbine length gas system. The barrel has never been fired or mounted on an upper. I originally bought this barrel for an SBR build, but I took the build in a different direction and no longer need this barrel. This is the perfect barrel for a pistol or SBR build. The 11.5 barrels have proven to be more reliable than 10.3/10.5"" barrels and allow you to use a wider range of ammo because of the longer barrel's increased dwell time. Feel free to look up how drastic the numbers are! You don't lose very much range or velocity at all going from a 16"" barrel down to this 11.5"". Comes with an all polymer lower that have been tested by many people and they have lifetime warranties. People have ran 10k+ rounds through these with no issues. ( You can research the fully built Plum Crazy or E3 Arms. These are the Model / Version 2 with the triggerguard big enough for gloves to fit in for reviews as this is what you will be receiving ) They help keep the weight down and make for a more mobile pistol with the short barrel. You will need to order a pistol buffer tube, Sig Brace, or KAK Brace before mounting this upper and receiver together for it to be legal. (IMPORTANT: Please read the laws on making this setup usable and not illegal if you are unfamiliar with the way pistol / rifle builds differ from one another. )It is illegal to have the upper mounted to the lower ( as it's currently configured ) you will receive without getting a pistol Brace, but I will include the stock buffer tube along with the stock for you to mount any 16"" upper you may have to the lower itself. It will accept 5.56 or .223 and I'll include 1 magazine as well.The only thing needed for this to run is a charging handle which you can get online or locally for around $20. I have 2 coming in the mail, one was for this, but I need the cash so I'm going to go ahead and list it. I will change this description if the charging handles do come in. ( you will get one if this doesn't sell before then, but I believe it will at the price I have it at. )~ I'm only asking $500 FIRM ~NO TRADES*Comes with, complete lower, the BCG, complete upper, a magazine. ( The only thing needed to make it run is a charginging handle, and you must swap the buffer tube to make it legal. I will have the stock off during the time of sale to make this a legal transaction )**I HIGHLY doubt you will find another UNUSED setup for this price anywhere.** This was purchased by me so I will need proof of FL Liscense to fill out paperwork to cover end of the transaction if anything ever happens to it. *I do have a brand new pistol tube with the spring I can include for an extra $40 and install it for you( as I will be taking the one I have for another build and need the money to replace it ). So you will not have to worry about running into any issues with putting the upper on the lower to use. *THIS WILL BE FIRST COME FIRST SERVE*I live about 30-45 mins west of Jacksonville towards Lake City and will meet at the Wal-Mart off the Macclenny exit if you are coming from Jacksonville.You can email me on here or best thing to do would be to text me at 904-5zero9-0517.Good Luck and I will reply to contacts in the order I receive them! If I'm working it was take a bit for me to respond, but I will get back to you!Thank You!"

Don't worry, I won't tell him to get his carry license until I see he is no longer wet behind the ears. The top dollar he wants to spend is $300. I know that leaves a fairly small market. He definitely does not want a revolver no matter what.Shoot me anything 9mm and semiautomatic that you'd be willing to part with for $300 or less, I'll do the research and pass it along and see how quickly He wants move on it.

They retain the style, function, shape, controls and most of the ergonomics of the larger double-stack handguns in that line, all while slimming down to make them unique. The biggest differences—all improvements—to this Shield over the standard Shield, are first in porting, then in the trigger and finally with the sights. The engineers at the S&W Performance Center mill two ports in the barrel and six ports in the slide of the Performance Center version of the Shield. The trigger breaks around 6.5 pounds, which is spot-on for a defensive striker-fired gun. The Performance Center-enhanced sear shortens and smooths the trigger reset (enjoy that audible click as you let the trigger forward) and the Performance Center-optimized striker plunger improves the trigger pull. The striker resets after only 0.27 inches of the slide’s rearward travel. The fiber-optic sights are an excellent touch. The housings around the rods are steel, which is a plus, and the rods glow noticeably, even in low light, and really help you see the sights against dark-colored backgrounds.         Stock Number:   SW11630     Manufacturer id:   S&W     Accessories:   2 Mags     Action:   Semi-Automatic     Type of Barrel:   Ported     Barrel Length:   3.1""     Capacity:   7Rd & 8Rd     Finish/Color:   Black     Caliber:   9mm     Manufacturer:   Smith & Wesson     Manufacturer part #:   11630     Safety:   Thumb Safety     Sights:   Night Sights"
