Shoots very well for its size and the trigger is exceptional. The trigger is the Apex red flat-faced duty/carry trigger kit, complete with duty/carry springs, set sear, and firing pin safety. Also has a set of Truglo TFX (similar but better than the standard TFOs) night sights. Grip is stippled to add a comfortable yet grippy texture because the stock grip was way too slick. Just the one 7rd mag because I never used the 6rd and it was in my ammo box that was stolen. Two holsters included: my Alien Gear IWB and a Blackhawk Serpa with OWB belt paddle and one other attachment. I think it's the belt loop one. Will require a bill of sale to be signed and will provide a copy. That covers my ass and yours. PM me or text me at REDACTED for questions and more HD pics.

This is the one he calls the Half Breed, it's a half recurve/half longbow. A right hand bow marked at 60 lbs. draw weight. It is also a Takedown model. I can't recall all of the fancy woods used in building this beautiful bow, but I do recall that the tips are Elk horn. The photos do not do this bow justice. It shoots like a dream and is very smooth. This bow cost $675 when it was built. I'm letting it go for $265. There's not a thing wrong with it and the string is brand new from Pekly's in St Albans, with Silver Fox tail silencers on it. Email me if you want more pictures or one of something specific. Included are; a nice leather quiver, a few crappy arrows that need fletching, leather glove and forearm protector.  If the listing is still up the bow is still available."

It was produced for standard issue to all Soviet infantry from 1930 to 1945. Most Dragoon rifles were also converted to the M1891/30 standard. It was commonly used as a sniper rifle in World War II. Early sniper versions had a 4× PE or PEM scope, a Soviet-made copy of a Zeiss design, while later rifles used smaller, simpler, and easier-to-produce 3.5× PU scopes. Because the scope was mounted above the chamber, the bolt handle was replaced with a longer handled, bent version on sniper rifles (known to Mosin collectors and shooters as a ""bent bolt"") so the shooter could work the bolt without the scope interfering with it. Like the US M1903A4 Springfield sniper rifle, the location of the scope above the receiver prevents the use of stripper clips. Its design was based on the Dragoon rifle with the following modifications:Flat rear sights and restamping of sights in metres, instead of arshinii.A cylindrical receiver, replacing the octagonal (commonly called ""hex"") receiver. Early production 91/30s (from 1930 to 1936) and converted Dragoon rifles retained the octagonal receiver. These rifles are less common and regarded as generally more desirable by collectors.A hooded post front sight, replacing the blade on previous weapons.[17]"

Just don't find myself using it as much as I had originally thought I would so I'd rather sell and put the money to better use or trade for something that will see more use. Will consider all reasonable offers but I am being picky. No Glocks, no AR's unless it's really something special, no AK's, no homebuilds. Top trade considerations: Tikka CTR, Remington 700 w/ threaded 18-20"" barrel. Ruger/SW .357/.44 revolver with 4-6"" barrel. Marlin 1894/1895. HK P30, SIG P220/226/227/228/229(especially stainless elite), Kimber or Sig 1911 with rounded butt/bobtail (super carry pro/master carry pro, fastback carry). Walther P99/PPQ M1. Mare's Leg. CZ Bren carbine or pistol. Would even consider nice crossbow setup. Would also consider other sporting goods or outdoor equipment/tools/powersports. Make me an offer and see where it goes. Multi-item and +cash trades welcome. I will not respond to light offers. Trade offers should reflect similar value. I am willing to add cash or items towards certain higher value offers. Text is best. REDACTED Can take/send pics upon request. Face to face transaction only. Must have valid CPL or Purchase Permit as this must be registered as a pistol in MI due to it measuring under 26"" with the stock folded and the flash suppressor removed. And again, I am being picky. I have considered plenty of tempting fair trade offers but nothing that has got me to pull the trigger yet."

The magazine well is beveled, for lightning-quick tactical mag-changes without taking your eyes off the target. The combat trigger guard facilitates the use of the handgun while wearing gloves, as well as an ideal and secure placement of the off-hand; also, the front and backstrap are checkered to ensure a positive and consistent grip. Lastly, an integral Picatinny rail enables the easy mounting of tactical accessories such as lighting and sighting systems--without any gunsmithing or modification to the pistol. Reliable and Easy to ShootEngineered to withstand the hardest use in the most demanding conditions around the world, the M9A1 meets and exceeds the standards of reliability of professional military and law enforcement. This handgun will reliably feed most commercial ammunition designs, including the wider hollow-points and the hardest-hitting +P.

Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome.

Again, this item is brand new and has never been carried, loaded, or fired outside of the factory test firing. My price is firm at $450 cash for the pistol, Glock hard case, three magazines, four backstraps, blackstrap holder, extended frame pin for larger back straps, cleaning rod and brush, Glock safety manual, lock, and Glock ""speed loader."" I am by no means am pressed to sell this and am not losing money by it remaining in the safe therefore my price is firm, no exceptions. Any offers below my price and all trades will not warrant a response as I do not have the time to respond to offers that are not within what I have clearly outlined above. Glock's MAP pricing for this item is set at $539 plus Ohio tax which means the cheapest you will find this new through a dealer is roughly $578. Buyer must meet at Kroger off of I-71 in Mason as I will not drive due to all of the flakes on here. Please do us both a favor and check your location in relation to mine (45040 zip code) before contacting me and also ensure you are committed to the purchase. I hate to be straight forward but unfortunately in recent years a lot of flakes and tire kickers have come out of the woodworks on this website. Buyer must also present a Valid Ohio Drivers License or Valid Ohio CCW License at time of sale to remain in accordance with Ohio Law, fellow CCW holders will take priority. All local and federal laws apply and cash only. If you are interested in meeting to purchase please contact me through this listing. Thanks"
