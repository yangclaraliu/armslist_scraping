Soft case.This MAB Model A is in good, functioning condition with all matching part numbers. Manufacture d'armes de Bayonne (MAB) made the Model A from 1921 to 1957. It is patterned after the Browning FN 1906 / Colt Model 1908. The MAB Model A is a single action, striker-fired, semi-automatic pistol with a blowback action. It has a manual safety on the left side of the frame, a Browning-style grip safety and a magazine safety.The pistol is marked:Left slide: Pistolet Automatique MAB Brevete Modele A   25Right slide: Made in France for W.A.C.The barrel is marked: CAL. 6.35m/mSerial number is struck on the right side of the frame and inside the frame under the recoil rod.The frame, barrel, slide and other small internal parts are numbered and numbers match.The MAB Model A was imported into the USA by W.A.C. - Winfield Arms Corporation was the distributor for Western Arms Corporation, essentially the same company, with the same initials. Based on the serial number and production dates published by Ed Buffaloe (unblinkingeye.com), the production date of this pistol is estimated as June 1951. Although I consider this pistol a collectible, I have shot it with a full magazine charge three times. It functioned perfectly each time.Pre-owned, used, vintage, curio and relic, and antique firearms or other weapons are sold as-is with no warranty, expressed or implied.I’m selling this pistol and other parts of my collection to pay for some recent rifle and reloading purchases.Payment can be USPS Money Order, or any other type of certified check or money order. Credit card can be used through Google Wallet.Requires FFL transfer to ship. I will ship out of Texas, but require FFL to FFL. Shipping FFL to FFL is $20 US Priority Mail. Shipping is cheapest if I use my FFL dealer. He can ship via USPS, but MUST ship to another FFL. You will need to send (or have your dealer send) a copy of the FFL along with payment. $20 will mostly cover my costs for USPS Priority and FFL transfer fee - add $5 if you want the shipment insured. Once USPS tracking indicates the it has shipped, the gun is yours, so consider insurance carefully.If you live nearby, I will consider local pick-up. You will need to show a valid TX drivers license. CHL is preferred. If you cannot legally own a firearm, do not contact me."

It takes the concept of a modular rifle to futuristic levels, while maintaining an absolutely simple operation that make it ultra-reliable. With ambidextrous controls, easily-replaceable barrel and virtually endless possibilities for customization and accessorization, the ARX100 is adaptable to any firing scenario and is perfect for today’s most demanding tactical shooter. The ARX100 features a constant contact/short-stroke gas piston system that makes it feed and fire under the most unforgiving conditions. The lightweight technopolymer receiver allows for reliable operation with virtually no lubricants. To make maintenance easy and trouble-free, this rifle has no pins and can be completely disassembled in a matter of seconds with no tools at all. This rifle was designed to be completely ambidextrous, and all the critical controls on it may be operated right- or left-handed. These include the 2-position safety, the magazine release, the bolt release and charging handle and the case-ejection selector, which determines whether spent brass is ejected to the right or left. The flip-up backup sights that come standard on the ARX100 are also versatile, offering an easily-adjustable diopter system ranged from 100 to 800 yards. The barrel is also easily replaceable in seconds, making is possible to use different lengths and calibers without any tools required. Lastly, the folding stock is adjustable for length of pull at the touch of a button, using a simple and rugged telescopic construction."

Below is a list of the work done and who did it:--Stippling by @worksarmament (on Instagram). Josh has changed his stippling over the years; he did this one before he started doing recessed stippling. This gun was done almost three years ago. ~$300--Slide milling done by Doug Presson ~$250--Cerakote (burnt bronze) done by Weapon Works ~$50--10-8 Performance U-Notch rear sight with a Trijicon green dot front. ~$100--Agency Arms Magwell ~$100--Agency Arms flat trigger ~$150The gun has been carried and it shows it, as you can see in the pictures. It will come with the original Glock box and two standard capacity magazines as well as accessories mentioned above. I've got easily over $1,550 into the gun between the gun, the work, accessories, and all associated shipping costs. Work done like this from quality companies can have a substantial wait time. Buy this and you're done. I don't need to sell this, I'm just looking to do another Glock build and don't need as many as I have! I'm willing to negotiate on the price, but with that said, please don't send absurd offers.Buyer must have a valid Michigan ID and CPL with RI-060 or purchase permit."

Same size and feel as a 45 without the recoil and high cost to shoot. Low round count and like new in box. I bought this and customized it to get into IDPA but never did. It has been Profesionaly Cerakoted and a trigger job done. Comes with with 3 Wilson Combat Vickers Duty magazines Cerakoted to match and the two facory mags that came with it. Also has Houge Extreme Series G-10 grips with matching mainspring housing that create a magwell. Also has a Hi Viz green Lite Pipe front sight installed.

Unless it is a 1500 dollar AR to begin with. Let me know how much your willing to throw in boot with the AR.

You can also call REDACTED (land line) if you have trouble reaching my cell number. 1000 is a steal for what is in this gun and the better than new condition. All the work was done to a brand new gun not some beat up wore out piece. Like I said I built it to get into IDPA and not only be competative but to look good as well. But I took a new posistion at work and do not have the time now. It comes with the box and all paper work and a Blade Tech holster witch from what I have read is suppose to be one of the best for IDPA.

Glock 17 was the original polymer again which changed the gun industry forever. The generation one Glock is very distinctive from other generations it features the pebbled textured grip with no finger grooves. The 17 Elm is distinctively different than the standard 17 and has a 6 inch barrel and an open top slide it to help the barrel cool. In addition to that this Glock 17L has an open cut slide and an added mag well which will assist the shooter in speedy mag changes. The original owner told us that this was one of the Glock-Works (now Zev Technologies) early projects. As you can tell my pictures this is no ordinary Glock 17 it has a different rear site which is easier to pick up while on the move. In addition this is not only the gun but the old competition rig.

Same size and feel as a 45 without the recoil and high cost to shoot. Low round count and like new in box. I bought this and customized it to get into IDPA but never did. It has been Profesionaly Cerakoted and a trigger job done. Comes with with 3 Wilson Combat Vickers Duty magazines Cerakoted to match and the two facory mags that came with it. Also has Houge Extreme Series G-10 grips with matching mainspring housing that create a magwell. Also has a Hi Viz green Lite Pipe front sight installed. The gun shoots perfect and extremely accurate. The only trade I am interested in is a S&W .460 with 8.375 barrel or possibly a .44 magnum. Or possibly a nice AR with boot on your end. Unless it is a 1500 dollar AR to begin with. Let me know how much your willing to throw in boot with the AR. I have around 900 in the gun 200 in the cerakote of the gun and mags alsmost 200 for the mags 140 in the grip set 50 for the trigger job and another 40 in the front sight. So if you want to make a offer please be realistic. You can text pics of what you have and offers to REDACTED or reply to post. You can also call REDACTED (land line) if you have trouble reaching my cell number. 1000 is a steal for what is in this gun and the better than new condition. All the work was done to a brand new gun not some beat up wore out piece. Like I said I built it to get into IDPA and not only be competative but to look good as well. But I took a new posistion at work and do not have the time now. It comes with the box and all paper work and a Blade Tech holster witch from what I have read is suppose to be one of the best for IDPA.

I have not fired it yet. When I got it, it seems to never have been fired because it wasn't lubed nor dirty nor did it have any wear marks on the barrel. The wear marks that are visible in the picture were put there by me breaking in this pistol's trigger by dry firing it a few thousand times. The trigger is well worked in and much better pull than when I got it. This pistol comes with 2 new RUGER 6 round LCP II magazines shown in the picture, and the rest of the accessories shown in the picture, the lock & the soft pouch. It is heavily lubricated now. The right hand belt clip is a kel-tec product sold on ebay for the kel tec .380 auto and supposedly according to the seller, the LCP but it looks a little funny to me. But it works it won't come off because the head is stripped. There are some abrasions on the plastic frame where I installed the clip and on the front. I have large pictures I can send to your email. I have a picture showing  I painted the sites with red and yellow fingernail polish to increase visibility.If you are out of state buyer, from what I understand, you have to this purchase shipped to an authorized, licensed firearms dealer. also I need ID proof that the purchaser is 18 years of age and legally able to own a firearm (no felons, foreign citizens, domestic abusers, etc.) . also, i will not sell and ship to Califorinia residents since I am looking at the legal information that came with my LCP II which says it does not comply with California laws. I take cash, personal checks that have to clear my bank before shipping and money orders. so if youwant to meet to pick it up, you need cash or a money order.

The package includes a Harris bipod, a SLIK tripod with Hog mount, cosine indicator, sling, custom drag bag, shooting bag, and P3 ultimate monopod. This package has let me continually make 1/2 moa shots out to 700 yards if you have the right ammo, if you can not reload then I would suggest FGGM 168 gr BTHP. The rifle has had 250 rounds through it (barrel life is guranteed by FN to last more than 10,000 rounds) and none of these were hot loads. Also, the scope is not included in the package but if you want a great scope I do have a vortex viper pst 6-24x50 FFP that I can add for 800 dollars or a Bushnell XRS (what I used on this rifle until a few months ago) that I can add with badger rings for 1500, it is like new.
