Comes with Carbon Fiber Bolts and 3 IIRC Aluminum Ones and rail lube. 100 practice/game heads, most already installed. A great combination in my opinion. I searched a lot of places and am very happy with these.
X-Bolt Soft Case ( by GamePlan Gear ) that has been very nice. It has the proper backpack shoulder straps which really are nice and adjustable. It also has a 3 number spin combination on there for a little bit of security I could throw in if your interested. Nylon Self-Healing Zippers and Rugged 600D Endura Fabric.
What makes the Shadow Ultra-Lite unique is the carbon-injected polymer barrel and trigger housing, which greatly reduces the weight of the crossbow.
The trigger is very nice and crisp, especially from the factory. Much better than a typical striker fired handgun, Glock, M&P...
I haven’t used it very much and doing no good just sitting inside.
I can also include my Morrell Double Duty 400 FPS Field Point Archery Bag Target that is used. It does sit outside now, but it's all covered up. However, that is going to stay in Minnetonka, so if we do the deal in Coon Rapids then we’ll have to figure out later when we can meet up in Minnetonka. I am in Minnetonka a fair amount at times (for last 5 days and will be for another 2-4, but it Really varies (updated 060417)).
This I’ll let go for $30 extra.
Thanks for your time,

This is the kind of inflatable that is used to go whitewater rafting or just a day out fishing. It can fit on your large boat to get you to land when anchoring as well, but as you can see it is big and rated to sit 5 people. New without the trolling motor is around $500. I'll take reasonable offers and will consider trades. I was told this had only been out once and put in storage, doesn't appear to have been used. Slightly dirty looking in spots from storage that might clean up as I wiped it down and got most of it, some bleach or vinegar may get it sparkling white, but not a knick or scratch, rope looks brand new. Trolling motor looks near new as well. Has foot pump and takes about 15 minutes to inflate using this method. Trades and cash offers considered.
