The result is rim fire performance of extreme accuracy.Other features of the MRI Magnum Lite® include a .22LR Bentz target chamber designed specifically for semi-automatics and a full floating barrel with an 11 degree muzzle crown for maximum accuracy. Magnum Lite® receivers are CNC machined from a 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum forging and include an integral Weaver type rail for optics.

MRI bolts are manufactured and machined from heat treated and through hardened 4140 steel with minimum headspace for better accuracy.The patented graphite barrel is unique to MRI. It provides lighter weight, better heat dissipation than steel and is extremely stiff.The Magnum Research MAGNUM LITE® receivers are CNC (Computer Numeric Control) machined from a 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum forging and include an integral Weaver type rail for optics.

I will only ship it to the address on the FFL. Before we meet, you will have to send me your valid Driver's License and FOID so I can run the number through the ISP for an approval number. Once we get the approval number, we can schedule the meet up. No cash will be exchanged, you will have to pay on Google Wallet or Paypal F&F. Once the funds clear (usually immediately) we will be able to schedule the meeting. When we meet, I will have a bill of sale for us both to sign, I will take a picture in person of your foid next to the firearm and we will be good to go! Illinois is very anti-firearms and the laws surrounding legal transfers are particularly finicky, so I want to do everything as safe, legal and on the up-and-up as possible. If you have any questions, please ask and I'll get back to you well within a business day. Thanks!"

If you're looking for a Gen 4 Glock 20 with everything that comes with the new firearm I can make you a hell of a deal. I've shot only 11 rounds through this gun. I did have the slide cerokoted in sniper gray due to Glock's lousy finish and any smears in the pictures are fingerprints only. The finish is much better than new and it's absolutely flawless. I've polished the internals but left all the OEM parts. It comes with 3-15 round magazines and all backstraps but have never tried to install any of these. I did purchase a Blackhawk carbon fiber right hand OWB holster which will go with it. I will sell the gun with all the ammo in the pictures plus an extra box of SIG FMJ minus 11 rounds for a total price of $ 525.00 OBO ! Buyer pays transfer fees.If you are looking for a Glock 20 you owe it to see this one !! I can meet with you to do an inspection if you like. FFL transfer preferably in the Springs.

Though it's not an exact copy, it's incredibly close. For those also unaware, the the PPK is one of the most popular and enduring CCW pistol designs in existence, having been in production since 1929.
But the .380 isn't a 9mm, you might object. No, it's not, but a subcompact pistol is meant to be used up close and personal, and the .380 Auto cartridge is very serviceable with the right load at close range.
This pistol uses a DA/SA mechanism, so it will require one to learn the intricacies of the double-action trigger system. The safety is a pin block/decocker, so cocked and locked carry won't be possible. That said, it's a proven design and a very popular deep concealment pistol. They're in most gun stores and the Matte Finish model, the most basic of them all, can be had quite frequently for $1000. If that isn't a slam dunk...nothing is"

I have Ameriglo Hackathorn sights installed on the pistol which are a great defensive/target shooting set up. I have holsters made by High Country Holsters, BladeTech, NSR Tactical, and White Hat Holsters. I'm not sure about the round count as I've not paid particlar attention however it's never hiccuped and the recoil spring has been replaced within the past month or so. I'm switching to another pistol for carry so I'm offering this to anyone who isn't invested in a particular system or someone who just wants to add to their existing system. Thanks."

Id prefers another firearms trade but I'm open to literally anything. I don't use these two anymore, so figured id pass them along to someone who would. the first gun is a Remington 870 tac model- 6+1, 18.5-inch barrel. Comes with Magpul furniture. the shotgun has a round count of about 350, mainly slugs and 00 bucks. id value the shotgun at 400,375 at the lowest. The other gun is a hipoint .45- a little used and abused but I bought it for a cheap gun to teach people how to shoot handguns before moving them to something else. id value it at 100 bucks, maybe less. I don't have any pictures of it currently, but can include some per request. Comes with two mags. Clearly this isn't a top of the line gun, so consider it more of a trade sweetener with the 870. Id prefer to trade both at once. Please TEXT all offers to 480-71zero-77zero7, or reply to this ad. Thanks a ton, hope we can work out a deal!"

This was my wife's second one ring which we bought over 10 years ago (still have original receipt and paperwork). We upgraded again two years later, however Helzberg Diamonds did not offer what I thought was a fair trade in, so we kept the ring and I meant to sell it, but life happens and it sat in it's box with it's paperwork for the next 8 years in my desk drawer at home. So I took it to a highly regarded jeweler in my area to have it cleaned ( all pictures are after the cleaning) and reappraised. The value is close to 5k and I know I won't get that, but I would like to get close to 3k in trade or cash or both. I am flexible a bit as I forgot about this ring once and don't want to do this again. Below is a list of what I am willing to trade for. Obviously not all together, but if you have one or two of any of these and need a ring I would love to talk with you.  The items I'm willing to trade for will probably require cash as well to either party depending on what items are bend traded. I will only meet at my 5 star rated jewelers in the highlands so you may inspect the diamond under a microscope and receive his guarantee and I can inspect the firearms. He has security so both our safeties are secured."
