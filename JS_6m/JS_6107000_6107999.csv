I will not entertain that price again, and will probably just keep the gun after the holidays if it dosn't sell so here is your chance at a steal of a deal.Used Benelli M2 Field. (3-Gun Combo)I built this kit to be a do it all settup for hunting and 3-Gun. It was a great settup when I had time to shoot 3-gun, but I don't anymore and this is just taking up space in the safe. If your a hunter and like to shoot 3-Gun or have other ""tactical"" requirements for a shotgun, this is a great setup for you.The shotgun comes with a 26"" barrel and stock spring, plug, etc. for a hunting settup.It also has a 21"" barrel with a Nordic Components extended mag tube for 3-Gun competition.I have beveled the Magwell for ease of competitive reloading and re-finished the gun (Micro-Slick on the internals, CeraKote on the externals).You can see in the pictures, the cerakote has chipped away a bit in some areas. This is from bumping barricades in comps and sliding around in the duck boat. The gun is in great shape but is used. Full disclosure: I have had a couple of failure to fires on the first round when using 3"" waterfowl loads. Immediateactions fix it and get the gun working, and it has not been an issue with lighter game / comp loads. It is probably about time to replace a few springs including the buffer spring to get it running perfectly though.Asking 1500.Will consider splitting the combo and selling the Nordic tube and 21"" barrel seperately. Offer."

Just supply the barrel you would like to have polished and can be returned same day or next day. General pricing is about $75 for pistols and $100 for rifles depending on how complex they are. Can discuss pricing. Polishing your barrel is mostly for cosmetic purposes. Polishing the feed ramp does however help the ammo slide smoother into the chamber.

Gun comes with ammo and leather holster.This is 1 of only 15k. Based on the year and lack of listings...I'd say you'd be hard pressed to find another. The majority are blued and snub nose.I did see a blued one with original box for $1600. I estimate if I had the box, this would be $2k easily. The most comparable one I found was blued: http://www.gunbroker.com/item/601824353From Wikipedia:The Detective Special was initially available in both bright blued and nickel finishes; a stainless steel finish replaced the nickeled option during the Fourth Series. For the Second Series, caliber options were .32 New Police, .38 New Police, and .38 Special; only .38 Special was offered for the other Series. The standard barrel length was 2 inches, but also a (rare) three-inch-barrel was offered during the Second and Third Series."
