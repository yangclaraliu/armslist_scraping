I have the original box the pistol came with along with manual and the tool for locking the Taurus security system.It's the perfect size pistol for EDC I think being about the same dimensions as some .380 pistols but in 9mm with a eleven round magazine plus one in the chamber. It has second strike capability in case of a bad primer.I'm disabled and can't drive so you would need to come to me so the pistol was priced with that in mind.I have my WI carry license and state I.D. and you must have the same. Also a bill of sale will need to be signed.Finally I should add that I need to raise these funds very soon otherwise the sale of the pistol will be pointless and I'll just close the ad and keep it.Thanks for looking and have a great day!"

It's sort of a mash-up design of a Saiga-12 and an AR-15. I swapped a bunch of parts to make it 922(r) compliant (so that you can legally use magazines larger than 5 rounds) and installed some upgraded parts. As I am the second owner, I can't verify the total round count, but I have personally fired exactly 150 rounds through it. It has an auto adjusting gas system (Saiga ""Auto Gas Plug"") and a Poly Choke II (which lets you adjust the choke pattern from extra full all the way to wide open just by twisting) which means you can shoot just about anything through it. The only rounds that have trouble cycling are low recoil birdshot rounds. I've had no issue with slugs, buckshot, or 3 dram eg birdshot. Also included are two 10 round magazines and a 20 round drum magazine.So why am I selling? As mentioned, I got this as part of a trade and originally thought I would like the idea of a magazine fed shotgun, however, I have come to find my Benelli M4 suits my particular needs better and I just don't have the safe space to keep both.New, the DDI-12 retails for $500. The 922(r) compliance replacement parts and the upgraded parts listed below would cost $482 new. I'm also including 2 10 round magazines and a 20 round drum magazine ($167 value). All in, I'm looking for $900, which is about 75% of new retail value.Saiga 12 Quad-Rail Forearm- Generation 2 - SGM TacticalBuffer tube + Magpul stock + Magpul .75 cheek riser + Limbsaver padPoly Choke II for Saiga-12 shotgun - ""Breacher"" styleTROY Industries Modular Aluminum Combat Vertical GripUS Palm pistol gripMD Arms booster puckAuto plugSGM Tactical Magazine, 10 RoundProMag Saiga-12 10 Round MagazineSaiga 12-Gauge 20 Rd Polymer Drum Magazine"

Guadalcanal Operation Watchtower had begun just a month prior. The Japanese had suffered major setbacks at Coral Sea and Midway. Operation Torch, North African Campaign was still in the planning stages. By the looks of this weapon, I doubt if it was in service for anything after that either. I am just a casual WWII historian so I bought Scott Duff's book; The M1 Garand World War II. The barrel date matches the serial number. The internal parts are properly marked for the manufacturer and date of this weapon. I took numerous photos so you can judge for yourself. The bore is clean with deep rifling. Please note the correct Springfield Armory Ordnance emblem, the circled P proof mark, the forged trigger guard, the upside down barrel marking. I will only ship to a FFL or C&R. Shipping to lower 47 states."

They made around 3659 Ideal Grades in 20ga., so it is not a ""rare"" gun. However, only 426 were made with the long, graceful 30"" barrels, and only 1/2, or about 210 total of those were made with ejectors. So this combination is a very hard gun to find. Add to the low production numbers the HIGH, FACTORY ORIGINAL CONDITION AND DESIRABLE FEATURES AND LIGHT WEIGHT and you have an incredible find in the vintage gun world. Some Elsies have a delicate balance making you believe they are true lightweight guns. Weighing 6lbs 6oz. and balanced 3/8"" ahead of the hinge pin, I was surprised when I put her on the scale. I would have guessed 6lbs. she felt so perfect in hand, not at all barrel heavy. In 1927 it was made with more care than some of the later guns that felt so clunky with the tall rib. The case color is 97% and vivid, the screws are near perfect, and the wood to metal fit is superb, with no cracks or splits at the apex of the locks............"

You get a brand new gun and not have to pay the man the tax. Face to Face EFA-10 method preferred, but not mandatory. If FFL transfer, you pay the fee.

MESA's MSC series Burglary & Fire Composite Safes offer a unique design that combines all the security features of high security safes from burglary and the peace of mind achieved with a fire safe. These safes offer a two-hour fire rating that is tested under extreme temperatures of heat in a fire endurance test. After it has been tested to endure and withstand the extreme heat, all while keeping the contents inside safe and protected, it is then tested for impact.  The drop test consists of the high security safe dropped from a height of 30 feet and then reheated for another 45 minutes to ensure the finest quality, protection and strength. The MSC Series high security includes a battery operated electronic lock that is protected by a drill-resisstant plate to prevent removable and forced entry inside the safe. If combinations are entered several times incorrectly, the electronic lock will go into a lockout penalty mode to prevent any further combinations to be entered, frustrating the burglar.  The all-steel construction and heavy-duty build of the high security safes make it tough for any thief to steal. Each safe weighs over 350 pounds and can be anchored onto the floor for secure placement that adds even more security. These safes also come with thick one inch diameter solid steel deadbolt locks that drive deep inside the body of the safe. The live locking bolts prevent the high security door from being removed when attempting to pry open the safe. In addition, the heavy-duty hinges enhance the safe by providing extra security and smooth operation of the door. With the high strength interior shelving that could be removed and adjusted, provides storage convenience to make sure all your valuables fit perfectly inside.
