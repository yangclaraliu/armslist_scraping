*Polymer Coated Bullets are hard cast bullets with a tough polymer shell which encases the lead projectile. They are similar to copper plated bullets, except the plating is made out of a Hi-Tek polymer instead of copper or copper alloy. Also, while many plated bullets are made of soft lead and can’t stand up to powerful loads, these hard lead alloy bullets hold up under higher levels of stress.
This subsonic ammunition is rated at 1060 fps.
Note – The maximum recommended velocity of these bullets is 2,400 feet per second (f.p.s.). They can safely be pushed up to 2,700 f.p.s., although the amount of smoke during firing increases significantly at those speeds, the polymer coating will still protect the bore from leading."

$800
According to Sig customer service, this pistol is one of only 75 made (please see the attached email from Sig customer service).  I bought this pistol new in July of 2006 while I was working the gun counter at Sportsman’s Warehouse.  What initially drew me to the pistol was the fact the box is labeled “1911, 45,  XO STS, CONT” and it clearly isn’t an XO model, but the S/N on the pistol matches the box. The pistol has probably had around 250 rounds through it.  I’ve drifted away from .45 ACP and I would like to sell this one to fund other weapons/ammo.  This pistol is rock solid and with the exception of a small “idiot mark”, there are no marks on it.  It comes with everything it left the factory with:  factory matching box, two Novak’s 8 rd mags, gun lock, & manual.  The pistol came with factory installed Novak’s night sights, but they are a little dim now.  This pistol does NOT have the “manhole cover” on it.  If you need it shipped, you pay shipping and insurance (to be calculated after the deal is done) and ensure your FFL will accept a shipment from a private individual.  I can accept PayPal (discreet), a USPS money order, or cash for a local FTF transaction.  At this time I'm not interested in any trades.Please let me know if you need any more photos and I will email them to you."

Last of the hand built Buell's. Harley Davidson 1203cc free breathing engine. Hand laid fiberglass body work that was meticulously factory painted with numerous layers of paints, giving it a color changing effect (this one is the rare blue/purple/black dependent on lighting). Hand tig welded frame built by an expert Nascar race car builder hired by Eric Buell. These bikes were built to go road racing right off the showroom floor, and cost more than most of the new Harley's they sold beside. This bike was completely gone through last fall with all new (nos) Buell and Harley Davidson parts: clutch and cable, throttle cables, Harley battery, new seals & gaskets, new brake lines & brake pads, calipers were rebuilt with new seals, new Michelin Pilot Pro rear tire & Pilot Pro 3 front tire, new Buell rider foot pegs, all bulbs, plugs, Screamin' Eagle plug wires, upgraded billet racing air cleaner/ head breather backing plate, White Bro.s racing muffler, wheel bearings, steering stabilizer, K&N air filter and more. Hidden underbody purple lights w/ hidden switch. It didn't really need anything, but was redone for the sake of reliabilty. Turnkey ready for the season. 2 new security keys, service manual, front and rear racing jack stands, extra new and used parts included. Passes inspection 100%. Have all take off parts (grips, pegs, etc. except factory muffler). These are the only Buell's that are collectible and becoming more valuable. Some items mentioned are not in pic's, I havn't taken new ones since adding the front tire, pegs, or changing the grips and pipe wrap to black. If it's listed, it's available. Don't ask. I don't respond to spam. I despise con men/scammers/spammers and people who don't read an ad before responding. Lowered price while I'm on vacation. Great deal. Once I go back to work, I won't care if I just keep it. Had it out for a nice ride today 6/21/17. Running perfect. $2500 b.0."

Mechanically it is like new. The wood (Walnut) is like.new, the receiver has some blemishes. Topped with a 50 mm  6x24 illuminated scope that makes a very nice addition to the rifle. 325 is a very good price, as unnscoped they are online in the $400's"

Looks great for its age and locks up tight like a new shotgun. Both triggers cock and fire strong, it undoubtedly works. I have never fired it. It takes regular sized 2& 1/2"" shells....but, the powder in a modern 12 gauge shell produces more pressure than it did when this shotgun was built, so it is my understanding that it isn't designed for today's ammo pressures and should be used with lighter shells comparable to what the pressures were at that time. The fellow I bought this one and another one from some time ago, told me that he shot them both with modern ammo all of the time when they were kids....but, that of course doesn't mean that someone necessarily should.Great shotgun but needing the extra cash so off my wall and now for sale."
