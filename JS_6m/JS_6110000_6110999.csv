It comes with N82 Tactical IWB conceal holster.Offering a 4-inch barrel to the 3.3-inch variant originally introduced, the 4.0 is only two ounces heavier and .7 inches longer than the original. Having had a chance to shoot both in a single range outing, I can honestly say that the .7 inches really do make a difference—so much so that I ordered the (slightly) larger and (very slightly) heavier 4.0 over the 3.3.With two passive safeties (grip and trigger), accessory rail, and fiber optic front sight, the XD-S would be pretty well-kitted out to begin with. Add in the other accoutrements Springfield Armory includes with each firearm (holster, double-magazine pouch, two magazines, extra backstraps and a lock) and the XD-S—or any of the models available in the XD and XD(M) series—is a very sweet deal."

It's a roomy single-wall tent made of XTC fabric that repels rain and snow with ease, and is tough enough to handle harsh foul weather. A heavy-duty steel frame ensures support to withstand wind and precipitation. The tent measures 12 ft. x 14 ft. with an 8'6"" roof tapering to 5'6"" sidewalls. The hexagonal design offers room for cots, gear and a stove around the sides while leaving the middle area open. We moved the stove area to keep the wall near the stove cooler. Three large multiple-panel windows include zippered covers, a clear-vinyl zip-out window and a mesh screen. There are three fold-down shelves that have mesh cup holders. There's a sidewall stove jack, a storm flap and a heat-resistant insert, as well as a zippered opening in the sewn-in floor for a stove. The inverted ""V"" door is outfitted with a heavy-duty zipper. Includes 12"" steel stakes, guy ropes and zippered storage bag. The stakes weigh 11 lbs. Tent and frame weight is 72 lbs. Imported."

Still, we are aware that there are some people who want a battle ready sword but hope to find one at a more affordable price. Our Warrior Series addresses this problem directly. In our efforts to reduce the costliness of the blades, we have omitted the expensive mirror polishing that we used on our Emperor Swords to create a new series of Japanese swords with a more practical finish. The Warrior Series swords are very handsome in their own right and share the same steel, heat treatment, and sharpness as their more expensive Emperor counterparts. Like the Emperor swords, they have Same covered, cord wrapped handles and quality fittings. If you're in the market for a strong, good looking, reasonably priced Japanese sword we know you'll be happy to own one of these.

(26 ml) Release Agent, Measuring Spoon, re-useable Poly Mixing Dish, Mixing Stick, Brown Dye, Black Dye and Complete Instructions.Super New Acraglas, Nylon Epoxy Derivative, Butter-Smooth Consistency, Mixes With Atomized MetalsOver the years we had hundreds of customer requests for an epoxy accurizing compound with a butter-smooth consistency which would neither run, drip or leach out from between wood and metal after being placed in the gun stock. After many years of research and testing, we perfected a modified version of our popular Acraglas® that gives the same super accurizing bedding job and also meets those specialized smooth application features you have asked for.Acraglas Gel was designed to take advantage of the latest technological advancements in epoxy research. It has the best possible advantages built into it for those that want a butter-smooth type of Acraglas.Nylon Derivatives are formulated into Acraglas Gel and provide greater ""thin strength,"" shock resistance and stability over normal temperature extremes.Slightly less shrinkage than that of Acraglas, which has an amazing 1/10th of 1%.1-to-1 mixing ratio gives a stable, molecular lattice structure to Acraglas Gel that will not crack, craze or sugar-out as will other 1-to-1 epoxies. Plus, this exclusive, 1-to-1 mix ratio, by volume, simplifies mixing and measuring small amounts accurately.Slightly longer pot life to give the user more time when doing the actual bedding.Longer cure time - The molecular structure of Acraglas Gel has been controlled so for the first few hours after the epoxy sets it remains slightly flexible, some of which flexibility is retained when fully cured.Readily blends with atomized aluminum, steel and stainless steel particles, thus making it possible for the user to create his own reinforced epoxy whenever such type epoxy is desired. Standard mix for optimum results is 1 part metal particles-to-3 parts mixed Acraglas Gel by volume.Can be dyed the same as Acraglas to match the characteristics of the gun stock being worked on.The above features of Acraglas Gel give you an idea of how completely we fulfilled your requests for a companion product for Acraglas ... The Acraglas Gel stay-in-one-spot feature ... sophisticated molecular structure ... slightly longer pot life and curing time ... the ability to mix in aluminum or steel, make this a product we are proud to offer to you and which, of course, we guarantee 100% as to quality of product, or your money back.USING GLASS FLOCBecause of the characteristics of the lattice, molecular structure of Acraglas Gel, the advantages of glass floc are already incorporated in the finished epoxy so the addition of floc is not recommended or needed."

Bluing shows some lightening in areas and especially on the barrel exterior. Very neat old Colt which serial dates back to 1919! $399 In 1908 Colt introduced a new medium frame revolver to replace the New Army & Navy models. The new revolver used the much better action pioneered by the Colt New Pocket and New Service models. This new model would be the basis for every medium frame double action revolver Colt produced up to the Colt Python of 1955. The design changed so little over the years that many parts from a 1908 Army Special would interchange with a Python made in 2003.   The new revolver was designed to allow use of more powerful ammunition like the .38 Special and the .41 Colt. It was an immediate success with police departments and under the Official Police name would be the standard police issue service revolver up into the 1960's. The Army Special was available with blue and nickel finishes. Barrel lengths were 4"", 4 1/2"", 5"", and 6"". Calibers were .32-20, the various .38 Colt Long and Short cartridges, .38 Special, and .41 Colt.

This gun was painted by its previous not so intelligent owner. Underneath the horrid home paint job is beautiful wood furniture. I began removing all of it but have tired of doing it honestly. The gun itself is in great shape and functions flawlessly. In its hay day, this was easily a $1200 shotgun. Due to the horrid paint job that's still present on the stock and forearm and barrel, I'm letting it go for $400. Only other issue is a crack in the forend but it does not impede function whatsoever. If you need an awesome duck gun, this is it. Removable choke tubes though I only have the one that is currently in it. I don't know much about hunting shotguns but this choke has two slashes in it. Those of you in the know will surely know what choke that is. 12ga, gas operated. No trades. Cash only. First $400 cash in Lexington area gets it. Will meet within reason."
