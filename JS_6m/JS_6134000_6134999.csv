These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You’ll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a match grade stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.Sometimes performance isn’t optional.

I have put close to 600 rounds through this gun and it runs like a dream. I've had 2 jams since I purchased this gun brand new and it was in the first 50 rounds which is not uncommon. Now it runs like butter. Incredibly reliable, smooth, and accurate. Honestly I don't want to get rid of it but I'm looking for a higher end concealed carry weapon than the one I currently have and before I can purchase (Kimber solo, Sig, etc.) I need to sell this one. I don't have a whole lot of use for this except for it being an excellent home defense weapon. It's too big to carry for me being a 5'1 woman. LOL Feel free to call me and I'd be happy to answer any questions. Pretty firm on price, I could probably move a little bit but I have a number in my head and I won't go below it. I know the used value on it is $602-$644 accoring to Blue book guide so I'm definitely being fair. Must be willing to sign a bill of sale. Thanks! Only serious inquiries please. Don't waste my time with sub 500 0ffers. I would also be willing to trade for a shield 9mm and cash or any of the manufacturers mentioned above. Thanks again!WILL TEXT OR EMAIL PICTURES UPON REQUEST! I MADE THIS LISTING AT WORK AND DON'T HAVE ANY PICTURES OF IT WITH ME. SORRY!Side Note: This is the 1911 Taurus made RIGHT after purchasing the BERETTA factory in Brazil. So, eseentially this is a Beretta 1911 because it was machined with Beretta's equipment and parts hence the Beretta reliability I have experienced with this gun. Also, comes with stock 8+1 mag and an extra 7+1 mag, case, and Safariland Holster. (Holster + mag was $75.00)"

Some of these rifles were touted as being new designs when in reality their origin clearly goes back to the AR-18, another Stoner design. The AR180b uses standard AR15 mags and is chambered for 5.56. I am offering the rifle with additional features from Midwest Industries & Stormerkz.  The Midwest pic rail is installed as pictured and the quadrail (also from Midwest) can be installed if you so choose. The rifle also comes with the Stormwerks type 2 stock adaptor. This adaptor allows the use of any AR15 style collapsible stock.

The Swedes,Danes and Finns built Remington rifles under contract at their factories, which were known for better steel.  This rifle has an amazingly excellent bore, it is mint, it has been fired but I doubt there is a better bore than on this rifle, it is clean,bright and land/grooves are sharp.  The barrel is approx. 35"" long, the caliber is the 11.7x 51R danish - very similar to the 45/70 - I have 2 vintage loaded cartridges and some paper patched .462 dia. cast bullets.  Brass can be made from 45/70 cases.  This rifle could be shot if desired, the action is tight,hammer is strong and is in excellent shape. The numbers match, the Danish crown cartouches are clearly marked, the frame case colors are mostly fadeing to gray, the barrel blue is still 90%. The The wood has many dings and heavy marks but is not cracked.  Definitely one of the better antique rolling blocks,  It can ship directly to your door.  More pics are available,  trades for quality firearms considered.  Thanks"

The Nickel steel receiver is turning gray but still has blueing in more protected areas. The barrel has a few areas of spotting, minor scratches but has 60% blue, with sharp corners and a very nice,clean bore with very good lands/grooves, the magazine tube has even better blueing. the take down locks up tight, the action is tight and crisp, this rifle has the special 32 W.S. rear sight. Overall a very nice,original 1894 to add to anyones collection at a fair price - please compare to Leroy Merz Antiques and others for grading/price.  I have more pics available, the rifle looks better than the pics/flash show.  I will only sell if you can legally own it - I do require a bill of sale with drivers license, I can ship to your FFL or C&R license. Possible trades for quality firearms considered, Thanks"

Designed/Constructed for 4 times greater reliability, effectiveness, and lifespan than the M4
This is a brand new complete ready to use matching and undesignated set of two with consecutive serial numbers. As the owner you get to choose your preferred configuration of rifles and/or pistols (this set utilizes rifle stocks and buffer tubes so if you choose one or both to be registered as a pistol you will need to purchase the required buffer tube / arm brace from another source). You will receive everything as described and seen in the pictures.
The M6 Piston Operated firearm, in 5.56x45, was developed by LWRC International for adoption by the US Military (M4 carbine replacement). Those trials were ended prior to selecting an improved service weapon. The M6 rifle and/or pistol components in this set were made by LWRC with the same military grade materials / battlefield ready core design. Also included are the following installed Enhancements:
- 11 piece triple polished Nickel-Boron Match Grade Package of Mil-Spec receiver parts
- Custom 3.75 lbs average pull weight Enhanced Reliability Trigger and Hammer springs with additional hand polishing of Fire Control Group (FCG) articulation surfaces
- Military grade internal receiver approximating movement eliminator wedge
- 4 layer matching Gray Acrylic accents sealed with a High Heat Ceramic Clear-coat
- 3 layers of Ceramic-Teflon Dry Film on all springs and pins, Buffer Tubes, and on all 11 triple polished Match Grade Nickel-Boron receiver parts (5 layers on FCG)
- Patented EXO Nickel-Boron permanent lubrication Bolt Carrier Group/barrel extension
- Exterior receiver surfaces coated with Teflon spray on the Mil-Spec anodizing
- Ambidextrous receiver plate sling mounts and bilateral QD mounts in the handguards
These have full 16.1 inch Carbine length threaded M6A2 NiCorr cold hammer forged 1-7 twist heavy barrels with Targeting Crowns, exchangeable A2 muzzle devices, and improved Piston systems.
Magpul MBUS (gen 2) front and rear sights in Stealth Gray.
Installed matching sets of sealed Carbon Fiber Hydrographic Magpul MOE components= 30rd  Pmag (gen 2), lower receiver Pistol Grip, and multi-position Stock (LWRC Handguards with 3 LWRC Rail Covers also installed). You must indicate to me in writting prior to sale if you are not allowed to have any or all elements in this offer due to applicable Local, State, or Federal restrictions.
Package deal includes these extra uninstalled Carbon Fiber Hydrographic Magpul MOE items: 2 additional Handguards, 2 Vertical Grips, and 2 Enhanced Trigger Guards (MOE vertical grips require an adapter or modification for use with the installed factory LWRC Quad-rail handguard but are fully compatible with the included extra MOE handguards).-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you would like to add a scope or red dot sight(s) then ask about the available options which will also be discounted if purchased with this package deal
The LWRC International M6 series is an improved and truly capable 24-7-365 replacement for the US Military service rifle made available in the civilian market.

By this time, the Marine Corps had followed the Army's lead in adopting the M1 as its standard battle rifle, but M1 production was initially unable to meet demand. In addition, much to the Marine Corps' chagrin, the Army had first priority on available supplies and on future output from Springfield Armory and Winchester, the two manufacturers of the M1 Rifle. As a result, the Johnson M1941 rifle was adopted by the Marines for issue to Marine Raiders and to newly-formed Para-Marine airborne units (because the barrel could be removed for ease of jumping the weapon), and these rifles saw action in the Solomons campaign of 1942. As M1s became available to Marine units, the Johnson rifles were withdrawn from combat use. Only a few thousand of these arms had been procured by the U.S. government before production ended in 1944, and, in addition to their limited use with the Marine Corps, some Johnson rifles were issued to clandestine O.S.S. operatives. Because the rifle was never officially adopted by the US military, and because WWII prevented any opportunity Johnson may have had for robust foreign sales, the total number of Johnson 1941 Rifles manufactured was very small, only about 30,000. Johnson Model 1941 Rifles were serial numbered in groups of 10,000, with the first 10,000 having no prefix, the second group with prefix ""A,"" third group with prefix ""B."""

The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free-floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. It has an ultra high impact polymer grip, made of DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. It is supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine.
