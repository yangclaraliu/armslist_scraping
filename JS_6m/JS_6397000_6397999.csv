I have only shot two 20 round boxes through it. (40 rounds). It is 30-06 very powerful and perfect for hunting, which I have not had the opportunity to do. It shoots clean and works well. this is a perfect entry level rifle, basic and decent. Any questions or reviews, please seek google, as far as questions about this gun regarding the condition, feel free to ask. I live downtown, but I am willing to meet in the middle for the actual transfer. Any meeting will need to be done at a gun store, only serious buyers please! The cheapest FFl transfer fee I am aware of is Don Gussler's in Santee ($45)Price is $300 make an offer!!"

The Trigger Kit directly replaces the factory hinged trigger with a solid aluminum trigger body which reduces pre-travel and over-travel by approximately 20%. It features a smooth, flat face with a center mounted pivoting safety that maintains factory safety values. The Apex Duty/Carry Kit for the M&P Shield was designed to provide the Shield pistol owner a smooth, consistent trigger pull that is approximately 2 lbs lighter (based on variations in factory tolerances) with the advantages of shorter over-travel and more detectable trigger reset.Expected Results – Reduces trigger pull by approximately 2 lbs. – Smooth uptake and reset – Reduces pre-travel – Reduces over-travel – Reduced reset – Center mounted pivoting safety maintains factory safety valuesIn short here is the total cost of the customizations.

The best of the 3rd gen ""all stainless steel"" 9mm autos from Smith and Wesson, the Tactical 5906 was built specifically for Law Enforcement and was made to their Performance Center standards with the slide and frame cut from the same block of stainless and staying together throughout the manufacturing process. The slide also rests on additional fulllength rails running nearly inside the frame like a CZ design which no one else had done up to that point. Delayed-lock firing system for less felt recoil, meprolight nightsights (which are now very weak) and an accessory rail was included (some came without a rail and this is one but might be available from Smith). This was a duty weapon at one time but wasn't fired that much, internally still in excellent condition, externally it shows a little holster wear on grips and the logo is a bit faded. This is a tank of a gun and shoots amazingly accurate, also com,es with two 15 round mags and case (not original). The TSW's are getting more and more rare and are highly collectible so price on this is 500 cash and trade value of 600.

This is an extremely hard to find gun. The SPAS 12 became famous in the 80's in the movie Terminaror and later in Jerassic Park. It is a 12 gauge shotgun that can be used in semi-auto or pump mode.This gun has an upgraded extension tube to hold 8 plus 1 shells, it also has an upgraded bolt release button. This model was built in the late 80's and has the desired safe button not the large safety knob that is often considered unsafe. I have replaced the buffer and o ring. The gun functions perfectly.This gun is a blast to shoot. I am only selling it fund another project.These guns sell for over $1500 when you can find them. Gun has a few pock marks from age that these guns tend to get. I have uploaded photos that show pock marks. I am asking $1200 or possible trade for nice AR/Arsenal AK 47/74, cz75 compact, 1911, of equal value or with cash added. It doesn't hurt to ask about trade, I'm not sure if I like somethings until I see photos. Contact Kevin at 813-340-98five2 Located in Lakeland. Can drive to Tampa also. Must be willing to sign bill of sale. No felons, dirtbags or flakes. If you look like a drug dealer I will walk away from deal."

Look up the prices of SAKO rifles and you will be surprised. SAKO are beautiful guns but original stocks are to prissy for hunting in the woods. The Bishop stock with the Thumbhole makes for a solid stable platform for great shooting.The 30-06 is one of the most versatile loads for bigger game shooting in the America's. My asking price is great compared to the new price of SAKO's especially based on the condition of this rifle! I don't hunt anymore but collect Antique / Vintage rifles / handguns so thinning out my safe to allow for new purchases. I will ship to anywhere in the Continental US. Also open to trades for Antique / Vintage Rifles / Hand guns (no revolvers) or Nazi marked handguns. You will find it hard to find this type of high quality rifle at this price!!!

I got this less than 6 months ago and have only mounted it to my AR (never fired or sighted in). The Eotech is in FLAWLESS condition seeing that its never been used however, when I got it I obviously wanted to put the battery in and check it out, in doing so I used a screw driver to open the battery cap. The battery cap is extremely tight fitting which caused the screw driver to slip and so theres a tiny scratch on the battery cap itself. NO, I am not going to knock a bunch of money off it as it is literally a scratch on the battery cap. If its that big of a deal you can purchase a new cap for around $25 shipped. I can send detailed pictures if requested. The current market price on these are $589.99 resulting in roughly $630 spent after taxes if purchased at local store. I am firm on cash price ($535) and trade value will be $600."
