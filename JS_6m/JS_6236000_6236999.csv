THe stock is a light colored, nicely figured, European walnut. It has typical narrow style european sling swivels. Beautifully stepped and sculpted European cheek piece on the right side of the stock for LEFT HANDED USE. The pistol grip has a rosewood fitting with personalized, engraved center device. The checkering uses an oak leaf border motif with fish scale checkering on both sides. The same checkering style matches the beautifully tapered forearm. There are a few light scuffs and small dings in the stock but overall it is in excellent condition. The action is a pleasing grey finish with a Edelweiss motif on the front and back receiver bridges as well as the highly ornate floor plate. This rifle was obviously built for mountain hunting so the decorative styling matches. The barrel is a full tapered octagon with a matte rib and iron. sights. The blue is perfect from end to end and the bore is bright and shiny. The rifle was built with claw mounts and a factory fitted high quality Swarovski 6X scope with 42MM objective. As you might expect it has the typical German crosshair. The rifle with scope tips the scales at 8.5lbs exactly. This is an unbelievably beautiful and functional rifle. if you are a lefty and want the very best this is for you.

I do believe it would be hard to find a better one that has not been restored. The NEGATIVE ISSUE with my rifle is it had a low mounted scope on it when I bought it, thus, the rear sight was removed and it got lost. The rear sight is obtainable on the Net for $50-100. I do have two magazines for the rifle.   I am wanting $465 for my rifle. Cash is preferred but I would consider trading for 410 ga or 20 ga shotguns, stainless steel revolvers, silver coins or bullion.

This allows for high rates of fire (700-900 rounds per minute) with no hammer follow and utmost reliability. It's quite literally the closest thing to a machine gun this side of the NFA.  Item Description: This trigger is designed with safety being of the utmost priority. When the operator is in the Echo Mode of operation and depresses the trigger one round is fired. The operator can move the safety selector to the safe or semi-automatic mode and a second round will NOT fire upon release of the trigger. This is a Drop-in design and comes with a stripped carrier with gas key & ambidextrous safety selector. This trigger has 3 MODES OF OPERATION: 1. SAFE MODE: Firearm will NOT fire. 2. SEMI MODE: Firearm fires when trigger is pulled. 3. ECHO MODE : Firearm fires when trigger is pulled and also fires when trigger is released. ATF Approved! Comes in unopened packaging and original shipping box.Here's an opportunity to get one before Christmas - $625 Shipped (Price Reflects Current 9 Month Backorder).

The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. That is 15,000 rounds! Not 500 rounds like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. This is unheard of in a production 1911! This recoil system also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil.Trigger pull, like all of our 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy you’ve come to expect from a Dan Wesson. The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control. Just like our Guardian, the ECO slide and small parts are treated with our Duty finish.. Stopping power is not a concern.If you’re looking for a compact, lightweight and reliable 1911 that beats the competition, look no further than our ECO. We are confident you won’t be disappointed.SKU 01968AmmunitionAmmunition 9mm LugerMagazine Capacity 7DimensionsWeight 1.560 lbsOverall Length 7.250 inBarrel Length 3.500 inHeight 5.000 inWidth 1.450 inFeaturesTrigger Type SingleSights Fixed Night SightsSafety Manual thumb safety, grip safety"

This is a very early Type 1 Pistol and features all of the earlier design features that were eliminated soon after this serial number including the 4"" barrel, separate barrel bushing like the colt 1911, and the very desireable ""Brownings Patent"" Patent markings on the slide, and type one fully blued magazine with high polished baseplate and fire blued follower. This Pistol also features the early high polish finish with fire blued small parts. This Pistol is in fantastic condition for being 102 years old retaining 90% plus of its high polished finish with nearly all fire blue remaining on the small parts. The bore is very nice as well with strong rifling and great shine with only a small amount of light pitting. Most of the wear is on the front and rear grip straps as expected. The grips appear to be replacements but I have an extra set of type 1 grips I payed $80 for that I will include with the Pistol I just didn't get around to putting them on. The last one of these I sold in this condition brought $1200 on Gunbroker about a year ago so this is a bargain. I will list this here for about a week and if its doesn't sell it will be listed on Gunbroker. These 1903 Pocket Pistols are extremely hard to find in this condition as most were carried constantly for protection. Will ship to FFL or C&R License holder anywhere in the lower 48 for $25.

The construction methods of this shotgun give the gun superior quality and reliability. No similar gun on the market compares to the quality and the RAPID fire ability of the DP-12.No costs are spared to provide the American public an ultimate home defense shotgun. This becomes obvious once you put this shotgun in your hands. The sheer firepower of this shotgun is virtually double of any other shotgun available on the market. Specifications:  12 gauge 18 ½” Barrels 16 Round Capacity   Standard Manufacturing – DP-12, 12ga., 18 1/2? barrels, 16 round capacity, single trigger, machined from aircraft grade 7075 aluminum, thermal coated receiver, inline feeding, dual spring rubber recoil pad, ambidextrous safety and pump slide release, pistol grip with non-slip rubber grip, screw in chokes, 34 slot Picatinny rail on top and 7 slot rail with foregrip on bottom, slotted for MOE rails, front sling and stock swivel attachments, shell indictor windows.

It is an extremely reliable Bull Pup 16 shot (7-2 3/4"" shells in each magazine and 1 in each chamber). It is a 2 barrel double pump shotgun that is a unique construction and protected by US and foreign patents.How does it work? Like a normal pump shotgun it operates with a single trigger, you need to pull the trigger for each shot. 1st pull firing the right barrel, 2nd pull firing the left barrel and it is pumped to reload.What is the QR code on the side? That brings you to the complete manual and troubleshooting page as well as specs for the gun. That can be accessed with your smartphone.Can I put slings on it? Yes, it has provisions for slings. There is a front strap housing to accept a 1” sling and the rear has multiple sling swivel attachments.Is this gun made for a right hand shooter or left hand shooter? This gun is completely ambidextrous. It loads and ejects from the bottom and it has a safety button on each side of the frame.Where is the safety? It has a large safety button on each side, right and left, on the frame.Why is a pump better than a semi automatic? It is much more reliable. Shotgun shells have many imperfections and anomalies unlike a brass rifle case shell. The pump operation offers a lot of flexibility to shoot, eject or remove any out of spec shells."

Caliber:   380 ACP
Original Factory Box includedAffordable protection made in the USA ..... that’s a Hi Point. One the best values for the money!
 
How can a manufacturer make a gun in the United States for such a low price? Simple design, easy manufacture, and inexpensive materials.   A Hi Point is elegant in its design simplicity. They’re blowback-operated, so there is no “lock up” to get compromised by a glob of mud.  Mechanically, there’s just not that much that can break. Read some of the reports on the testing of this gun. 
 
This gun relies on the weight of the slide to keep the gun closed during firing. When the slide is closed, it simply sits against the back of the cartridge when it goes off.  The slide moves backward from the blowback pressure of the cartridge, and is returned forward by a return spring.  The barrel is pinned to the frame so it doesn’t even move.  So as long as the slide can move backward and fully forward, a Hi Point cycles.   It won’t win a beauty contest, but it works!
 
The Hi Point warranty covers damage and normal wear and tear with no questions asked.  If it breaks for any reason—EVER–Hi Point will repair or replace the gun free for the life of the gun no matter if you’re the original owner or not."

This is a really beautiful weapon with ALL the bells and whistles. I bought it new and added a Timney 3 1/2 pound trigger that is smooth as glass. (I have tried the trigger a few times with a snap cap) It comes with KNS anti-walk trigger/hammer pins..(so trigger and hammer pins stay put when your firing) I also added an Aimpoint red dot scope and a Primary Arms flip to side sight trippler. If your not familiar with a setup like this, it lets you swing the trippler up in front of the Aimpoint and take shots well out to 100 yards and beyond if you have the weapon sighted in correctly. Then you have the option of swinging the trippler out of the way for close in shots. I have this setup on a couple more AR's and absolutely love it, it's the best of both worlds! Also comes with Noveske ""Flaming Pig"" compensator, Sig pistol stock, Magpul flat dark earth rail covers and Magpul pistol grip, Mako hand stop on bottom rail, one FDE Troy Defense 30 round magazine and one brand new, in plastic, Magpul gen 2 magazine .. It has Noveske black rifle manual and registration card with it as well. This is a top shelf, hard to find weapon, especially with these great upgrades. It also comes with a tactical, weather-proof, water-proof hardshell case (airline approved). I am asking 2000.00 for everything. (has over a thousand bucks worth of ad-ons) and if optics arent a big deal or you already have your own, I would offer the option of giving you a set of Magpul back-up sights, taking the optics off and sell for 1700.00. I'm not really looking for a trade but if you have something nice that you might want to use as a partial trade just let me know. Thanks for looking and have a MERRY CHRISTMAS!"
