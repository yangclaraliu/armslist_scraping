There are lots of people of armslist right now who cannot leaglly own firearms or have suspicious charcter/stories that have been trying to buy up guns. Be smart and go to a licensed FFL and pay \for the background check if your suspicous. It will be your fault when you unwillingly sold your gun to a felon or mentally unstable person. If they are not willing to do a background check or want to sell thier guns out of state, pass on the offer. I've have been contacted with numerous people over the years on armslist and other gun sites that are criminals trying to buy guns from honest americains. Do yourself the justice of doing the NICS check. I kid you not, some felons/criminals with records have the audacity to come in to a gunshop and try to pass a NICS and only fail. Good luck folks."

I'm needing to sell to pay some bills and just looking to get back what I paid for it.
In addition to the rigid quality controls of manufacturing, the feature that sets the Anderson AM15 Rifles apart from the masses is the proprietary RF85 treatment allowing Anderson weapon systems to operate efficiently without “Wet” lubricant. In a coefficient friction test performed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the reduction of friction on all steel surfaces was reduced by 85% — without traditional “wet” lubricant, hence the  name RF85. An RF-85 treated weapon cycles faster and more reliably, operates at cooler temperatures, experiences significantly less wear and, without traditional “WET” lubricant, doesn’t experience failures due to excess dirt and carbon fouling in the action.

It has a DPMS Parts kid inside of it and all in all you're very quality build. It comes with a slew of extra magazines but no ammo. I bought this thing thinking I would get into suppressors and change my mind. I'm just not ready for that level of commitment. And I have no use for this thing otherwise. I'd be willing to trade for almost any sort of AK rifle. Let me know what you have. Price is OBO.

My primary goal would be to trade for a SIG C3, SIG P229 Legion or Elite, a nice Commander (or smaller) size 1911 in 45 or 9mm, or a CZ-75c. The XO MSRP is over $1000, and that doesn't count the upgrades on this particular gun, which looks brand new. There are no flaws with the gun. I'm willing to consider options other than what I've listed, but no garbage, please. Additional cash can go either direction, if needed to balance a trade.Upgrades:+ VZ Operator II grips (Hyena Brown color), $65 upgrade. I do not have the original grips.+ Full-size steel guide rod, $35 upgrade.Also comes with:+ SIG TACPAC hard case+ SIG holster+ 2 SIG 8-round magazines+ SIG 1911 manual+ Gun lockThe gun fires every time and is very accurate. The sights are good 3-dot white contrast and provide quick target acquisition. The VZ grips are terrific, particularly when you realize this gun also has the 25 LPI checkering on the front strap. The combination makes the gun feel like it's glued to your hand. I am not the original owner, so I do not know a total round count. I really enjoy shooting it but just prefer a smaller gun.Description from SIG:Outfitted with contrast sights, the 1911 XO features SIG's durable Nitron finish designed for rugged use. The all stainless steel frame and slide of the XO are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to ensure reliability and performance. The frame features 25-line per inch checkering on the front strap. Like all SIG SAUER products the 1911 XO pistols contain only premium internal parts including a match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. For safety, the 1911 XO features a beavertail grip safety, extended thumb safety, firing pin safety and hammer intercept notch.CALIBER 45 AutoACTION TYPE Semi-AutoFRAME SIZE Full-SizeFRAME FINISH NitronFRAME MATERIAL Stainless SteelSLIDE FINISH NitronSLIDE MATERIAL Stainless SteelTRIGGER SAOTRIGGER PULL SA 5 lb (22 N)BARREL LENGTH 5.0 in (127 mm)OVERALL LENGTH 8.7 in (221 mm)OVERALL WIDTH 1.4 in (36 mm)HEIGHT 5.5 in (140 mm)WEIGHT 41.6 oz (1179 g)Prefer trade, but asking $850 OBO for straight sale.

This is very lightweight ammo- can barely tell a loaded mag from an unloaded mag yet it has insane ballistic results because it's traveling at over 2,000 ft/second - if you don't know about it you should look it up. Very awesome stuff. ""Pre fragmented""  so it breaks apart and dumps all its energy into the target instead of going through... also it won't over penatrate or go through walls - best choice for home defense. Sky marshals, many law enforcement and swat teams use them for this reason. These sold for $23.99 per box of 10.
