It is great condition; almost new. Almost no blueing wear and the barrel is in excellent condition for any rifle (not just for an sks). It looks like it has been shot very little if at all. It has been a safe queen since I traded for it. All numbers matching except it is missing the bayonet and the front top barrel gaurd piece has been replaced with synthetic. This is a very rare gun only beat out by a few extremely rare models like the North Korean, East German, or Russian Parade SKS's. izhevsk (the Russian arsenal that has been making Ak's since 1947) made SKS's for only part of 1953 and most of 1954; with the 1953's being about 1/4 of the izhevsk SKS's. The gun will come with an extra 30rd internal box mag, sling and scope mount with scope. While I have no doubt this fun would be a good shooter but it is really a collectors item and would be the perfect gem in anyone's sks collection. Please let me know if you have any questions. I will consider some partial trades but really looking for cash.  I will be doing some more research and updating this post but feel free to contact me anytime."

The P226 operates with a double action/single action design, with only 3 controls: the slide stop, the magazine release, and the decocker, enabling the pistol to be deployed quickly without having to flip a mechanical safety on or off. Sig semi-automatic pistols have several built-in safety features, including a hammer block and firing pin block that make them suitable for safe carry. The P226 Scorpion is constructed with an aluminum frame, and a stainless steel slide. The frame features an integral 3-lug Picatinny rail for attaching aftermarket sights and lights.

The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed.   Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear.   Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.   Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability.   Front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A2-style F-height allows co-witness with many optics.   Patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts most standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired.   Milled gas block is located at a carbine-length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface.   Medium contour cold hammer-forged barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.   Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control.   Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.   Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting.   Handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability.   Also includes: One, 30-round Magpul® PMAG®."

As with all my firearms, it was meticulously cared for, and cleaned after each outing, as you will be able to see in the photos. This rifle has approximately 600 rounds through it, and was only used at the bench. The only wear I can find in the finish is a small safe bump on the rear LWRC flip-up site, and some very finite spatter from the weld/pin of the specawar/omega suppressor mount/brake on the 14.7"" barrel. I am selling this and a few other rifles in order to fund an emergency renovation on my house due to a condemned fireplace, it would otherwise be going nowhere."

KKM barrels are the premium barrels for Glocks and are made in the USA. Read the reviews for conformation. If you plan on hunting with your Glock and plan on shooting the lead bullets, you will need one of these as Glock recommends against shooting lead bullets in their barrels. These barrels are drop in fit and require no fitting. I paid $175 when I purchased this from KKM plus shipping etc. I will sell for $150. I will ship inside Indiana for $5 dollars. I travel to Indpls. every week for those people in Indy."
