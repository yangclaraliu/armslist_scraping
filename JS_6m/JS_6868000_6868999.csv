The CZ is a really solid hunk of metal feeling gun. I've fired probably 150 rounds though it over the past three years I've owned it. I quickly got a smaller more practical concealed carry handgun and haven't taken it out much since. I've noticed that the magazine will ocasionally partially eject during firing. There's never a problem if you hold a second hand applying pressure under the mag as you fire, but its still a concern I feel I should mention. I think this issue could be quickly fixed up by a gunsmith. I waited almost two months to have this arrive as a special order from cz to the kittery trading post, so if you're looking for a convenient option getting this right away then fixed up to be more reliable might not be a bad option.

It's our fun time, and if it's too much for her, there's no point. With that being said, I won't be sad if I end up telling her there wasn't anything that I wanted to trade for, guess we'll have to keep it. LolIt's a heavy rifle, so she can't hold it up. I personally love it. Regardless, I'm willing to see what kind of offers we get. The rifle is in great condition for its age. Holds 10 rounds in its removable magazine and it shoots 308. I've put 50 rounds thru her without a hiccup, but I do have another 50 rounds I can include if the trade needs it. These rifles are extremely rare and have been selling between $750-1,300 depending on caliber and condition on gunbroker and will more than likely continue to go up. I'll just set the trade value at $750. Cannot include cash for a trade, so please keep that in mind. But I do have 230 rounds of 40 s&w I can throw in if that's of interest."

It is 12-5/8"" overall, is in mint condition with original sheath and all accessories. The blade is as new with a few rub marks showing up in the matt finish. It comes with a full-size Brunton compass and all the original survival gear. Very well done and my favorite of the factory hollow handle survival knives from the 1980's. Knife is at least 26 years old and a unique piece of Kershaw history. Everything is in excellent condition, including the knife sheath. This is a great, and I mean really great building block for an outstanding survival knife system. The sheath is almost as important as the knife because of all the pockets and heavy-duty grommets built in to it, that help you organize, protect and carry your gear. It was rated number three in a review of survival knives in the whole world back in the late 80's. They were last made in about 1989 by Kershaw. That makes this knife at least 26 years old and a unique piece of Kershaw history. The last time I saw one this good was about 9 years ago, and it sold for $350 on ebay. The following is from the 1989 Kershaw catalog: Kershaw's fixed-blade Survival Knife provides and added measure of safety in a multi-purpose knife designed for situations in the forest, outback, tundra, or anywhere a big knife for tough jobs can make the difference. It combines the sought-after features you need in a functional, durable knife. Its machete-shaped survival blade is made of Kershaw's AUS 8-A high-carbon stainless steel, sandblasted to a smooth non-reflective finish, and shaped with strong tang to assure a solid lock-up between the blade and the handle. Double cross-cut saw teeth on the back can saw through tough jobs such as wood, bone, and even metal. The handle itself is a steel pipe covered with Kershaw's Task Force™ polymer rubber grip, which is contoured with finger grooves for positive control. The Task Force handle provides a solid non-slip grip in all conditions. The butt can be used as a hammer without damaging the knife. Its threaded butt cap features ""O"" rings to seal a water-tight storage tubing in the handle, which can store emergency items, such as matches and fishing hooks and line. The oversized Cordura sheath provides two storage compartments, one for a full size compass and waterproof survival cards, which are included. This heavy duty sheath features wide loops for use with belt or leg straps, a fold down strap with quick-release clasp, and heavy-duty grommets. Sheath Contents: Full-sized compass. Waterproof survival cards Small sharpening stone. Reflective back-tracker strips. Medical supplies - Adhesive bandages; Antibiotic ointment; Suture & Needle; Safety pins; razor blade and more. Water purification tablets. Fishing hooks/Leaders. Monofilament line. Fluorescent fly tying yarn. Split shot. Waterproof/windproof matches. Fire-starter wicks. More The instructing waterproof survival cards are maybe the best and most helpful. Some of the things they show and explain will save your life but you may not like doing them. But as they say ""at the end of the day you are either alive or dead"". The survival cards are not shown in the photo below but they are 3"" X 5""."
