Didn't have any trouble out of it running. Got up to 85 mph. The only other thing I can think of is it does not have a title. But I know for sure it can get a title.

This is not a run of the mill Mosin, this is a US contract made rifle for the Czar, lots of history, and still shootable! It's not a Tikka but probably reworked by them or Sako between wars because that's who did that for the Finns. Will consider trades for Enfield rifles or Type 99 Arisaka."

When it comes to security for you and your family, there’s rarely a concern over having too much ammo on hand.
The XD® Mod.2® 5″ Tactical Model packs 16 rounds of 9MM ammo in each of its two included stainless steel magazines. While it’s a double stack design, it’s not too thick to carry like so many of our competitors’ models. Measuring just 1.2 inches wide, it is barely wider than single stack pistols with far lower capacity.
A pistol with a healthy sight radius is easier to shoot under stress, and that’s why we’ve chosen to fit the Mod.2® Tactical Model with a full five-inch hammer forged carbon steel barrel. It’s treated with Melonite® to stand up to moisture, sweat, and other undesirable conditions over the long haul."

I've never worn it so it is brand new. It is listed on the website for $64.95, but the ""nra"" coupon code brought it down to about $59. After shipping, my price is still a good deal. Plus, I actually made this holster better than new. Crossbreed's design is superior in all but one way. The kydex and leather keep your gripping middle finger from getting purchase. Every Crossbreed holster I buy needs this same modification. I relieved the leather and the kydex so your middle finger can get a proper grip before drawing. It took me about an hour to get it right and I think it is pretty good, if I do say so myself. I may have this listing open for awhile. This is kind of a specific gun/laser/light combo.

I've owned and shot a lot of AKM pattern rifles and for an entry level milled AK it's a lot better than anything IO has to offer and a step above a RAS-47, at least with the c39 you don't have to worry about cast trunnions. I'll throw in a 60rds of 7.62x39 too and a MI scope mount (yes it has a scope rail). Overall the finish is very good parkerization, the old owner sprayed it with appliance epoxy which I have removed but unfortuanly the top cover was not parked to the receiver so it's off color, I think it looks cool and gives the gun character. Overall with the krebs safety, scope mount and rail, furniture, and ammo your getting a lot for the value. ***FIRM ON PRICE***541.303.zero557"

With ambidextrous controls, easily-replaceable barrel and virtually endless possibilities for customization and accessorization, the ARX100 is adaptable to any firing scenario and is perfect for today’s most demanding tactical shooter.The ARX100 features a constant contact/short-stroke gas piston system that makes it feed and fire under the most unforgiving conditions. The lightweight technopolymer receiver allows for reliable operation with virtually no lubricants. To make maintenance easy and trouble-free, this rifle has no pins and can be completely disassembled in a matter of seconds with no tools at all.This rifle was designed to be completely ambidextrous, and all the critical controls on it may be operated right- or left-handed. These include the 2-position safety, the magazine release, the bolt release and charging handle and the case-ejection selector, which determines whether spent brass is ejected to the right or left. The flip-up backup sights that come standard on the ARX100 are also versatile, offering an easily-adjustable diopter system ranged from 100 to 800 yards. The barrel is also easily replaceable in seconds, making is possible to use different lengths and calibers without any tools required. Lastly, the folding stock is adjustable for length of pull at the touch of a button, using a simple and rugged telescopic construction.The possibilities for accessorization on the ARX100 are limited only by the user’s imagination. It comes out of the box with a full-length Picatinny rail on top, which is perfect for attaching a variety of optics and other sighting systems. It also has Picatinny rails on both sides of and under the fore-end, which offer countless possibilities for easily adding lighting systems and other tactical devices."

This is their famous RPK-based AK47, with thicker receiver and barrel than most stamped AKMs. Built on the same standard as the military RPK, Vepr is 50% more reinforced than a standard, stamped AK rifle. Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK barrel. This is the Cadillac of new AKs. Vepr in 7.62x39 caliber features a look similar to an AK, with a thumbhole buttstock and walnut foregrip. The hammer forged, chrome lined barrel is 16” in length, and a scope rail is riveted to the side of the receiver for easy mounting of a side scope.Each rifle comes with high quality, beautifully crafted walnut furniture as well as a rear sight with adjustable windage.SummaryVepr 7.62x39, 16-in barrel, wood thumbhole stock with rubber recoil pad, cleaning rod, cleaning kit, shipped with one 5-rd and one 10-rd magazines.I'm asking $729 plus $25 shipping to your FFL. I can remove the muzzle nut and install a Smith Vortex flash hider for an additional $100. I can also provide a brand-new-in-package VEPR-specific Ultimak for $112. If you'd like a set of Tech Sights,Munich almost doubles the sight radius, I can include that for $136.  If you'd like a Krebs Custom safety selector, I can add one for $55.  If you'd like an ALG Enhanced trigger, I can include that for $70. If you get the AKT-E, I'll include a free pin retainer.  Must complete 4473."

Browning Hi-Power SA Pistol; 1980's Feg, Hungarian Production; 9mm LugerOutstanding Hungarian-made Browning Hi-Power...likely produced in the 1980's, this is a solid example of the finest Hi-Power clone ever manufactured. Originally manufactured to supply Hi-Powers to the Warsaw Pact nations, the Feg Browning Hi-Power was a close enough copy that nearly all parts are interchangable with the Belgian-made original. This model was the first choice for countless European police agencies, and were even substituted for the ""genuine"" item in a shipment to Sadaam Hussein's government(roll-marked with fraudulent FN addresses). Appearing to have seen some degree of duty carry, this weapon may have been a European police trade-in prior to import. No longer in production, collector's have taken notice, but this weapon would still be an ideal duty or self-defense handgun for anyone looking for a Hi-Power and not wanting to break the buget.
