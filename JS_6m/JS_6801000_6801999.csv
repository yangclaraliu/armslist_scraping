With the 2016 bankruptcy sale of SAMCO, a major importer, 5000 of these rifles were discovered.Packed away in crates, since the '70's, and preserved in cosmoline, this was a major find. Although most 1916's are encountered in .308 caliber, the original reciever was not intended for modern commercial .308 chamber pressure. Original 7x57 Mausers in good condition are rare.This rifle is hand picked from one of the first batches to be released. It is a ""First Pattern"" with the rare ""lange vizier"" roller coaster rear sight.It has been completely disassembled. All cosmoline removed, and oiled. The wood has been cleaned, and treated to a coat of Linseed oil.There is NO pitting of the metal,which retains 75% of the original blueing. Bore has strong rifling. Wood has no cracks, and normal handling marks.All numbers match, reciever, barrel, floorplate, rear sight...excecpt the bolt, which is normal for these surpluse rifles.The original stamping  (Crown, ""Fabrica de Armas Oviedo"" and the year of manufacture  1925) are on the receiver.A great find for a historical example, a cheap ""Truck Gun"", or a fun shooter.I have fired 20 rounds through it. It functions smooth, and is accurate. 7mm ammo is plentiful in all grains.Supplies of this rifle, in this condition, are going fast.Original sling included.FTF Alabama residents only."

Five Round Stainless Steel. This high quality revolver is a workhorse ,with heavy barrel , stainless non-rust parts and butter smooth action. Comes with Crimson Trace Ruger SP101 Polymer Lasergrips LG-111-S. With brand new battery. As a carry gun you'll not find anything more reliable. Easy to load, check for safety , and goes "" bang "" every time you pull the trigger. The Crimson trace laser is activated when you grip the gun and is a good instructor for sight alignment. Hit what you aim at -even in the dark. Being able to practice with lighter 38 Special loads makes this wheel gun all that more useful & valuable. You can also use 38 Special hollow points. Everyone should have a revolver with 100% reliability as a backup to semi-auto. These stainless wheel guns really hold their value as there is little to go wrong with them. In the right leather holster it just about disappears. In fact , I'll throw one in with the deal. If you have a loved one who worries about the safety on a semi-auto- has trouble racking the slide- or gets stovepipes from weak grip this might be just what they need to regain confidence. I paid about $520 for the gun + $ 160 for the Crimson Trace grips. Certainly look them up on line & see if you can get 'em cheaper now. I'd take $550 for the package & throw in a leather holster made for it. Must have & Show ID & sign a bill of sale. Face-to-face only. No shipping. Might consider trade for M&P CORE, Henry 30-30.

But I have to sell mine before I can buy one. The 23 I'm selling has the three 13 round mags that came with it. 1 and a half mags are loaded with Hornady critical defense, the third is half loaded with FMJ. Comes with the case, cleaning brush, spare straps for the handle to accommodate bigger hands and comfort. And I just put the original back slide cover back on it but it will come with an aftermarket back slide cover with a pin up girl laying on a WW2 bomb.

I haven't used it a lot, but enough to break it in. It works well. It's in great shape and I've got 2.5 mags with it. I say 2 and a half because one of the 3rd isn't feeding very well, at least in my gun. I'm pretty sure it's because it's not catching inside the mag well very tightly. If I push up on the bottom, then it feeds fine. So in addition to the bolt replacement, you get 2 mags that work great, and 1 that might be fine in your gun, or might need a little work. As with all of these, the kind of ammo you use affects it's reliability a lot. This one runs great with higher-end target ammo. But it still runs great with any ammo that's a step up from the cheapest stuff (American Eagle jacketed hollow-points, for example, work great in my AR-15). If you're not familiar with these, it's a drop-in replacement for the bolt and magazine of an AR-15. It's really easy to swap the bolt out and shoot .22's through your AR-15 (nothing else to change)  Get all this for only $125! If you buy new, it would run $250 with the extra mags! Save over $100 just because I'm getting a dedicated AR style .22. 8zero1-89one-33two4 call or text Cash only. See my other listings.
