The stainless steel slide wears a beautiful mirror polished finish. Kimber workmanship and quality are easy to see, even down to the smallest detail. The melded forged stainless steel slide and lightweight aluminum alloy frame fit together with tight tolerances and function perfectly. Recoil on the Kimber Bel Air Ultra II feels significantly less than that of competing designs. This is due in part to this pistol's lower center of gravity, which is slightly below the slide, and very close to where the shooter's hand grips the gun. Although the single-stack magazine puts the Kimber's capacity at only eight rounds, the relatively small diameter of the 1911's frame still allow the shooter to create a secure two-handed grip. A match grade barrel and bushing deliver tack driving accuracy. For added reliability, Kimber includes a full- length guide rod, as the shorter G.I. style guide rods have a tendency to bind or break over time. Snag-free, low profile sights sit on top of the slide and provide a consistent target presentation. The checkering on the mainspring housing, along with the texture of the ivory Micarta thin grips feels secure.The knurled extended magazine release of the Kimber Bel Air Ultra II is a huge improvement over releases seen on other pistols. Performing tactical reloads is quick, simple and efficient. The Kimber Bel Air Ultra II single stage, match grade aluminum trigger is a joy to pull, especially over the mushy triggers seen on most double action pistols. The 4 to 5lbs pull is steady and smooth, while the reset is short and crisp. This is a gun that fires naturally, even for beginner's that have ""low and left"" trigger slap tendencies. In fact, the Kimber Bel Air Ultra II has one of the smoothest trigger pulls of any production 1911 on the market. Other features include a clean, single sided thumb safety. Many shooters actually prefer this style over the bulkier ambidextrous paddles. To further minimize felt recoil, the grip safety is a high-ride designed beavertail that quickly establishes a positive grip for maximum control in stress fire situations.

I want to buy my first firearm,  however I don't wish to buy a rifle or shotgun. My problem is that I'm 18. I've been running into a lot of trouble with people doubting the legality of selling a pistol to someone under 21. So if interested here's the terms:both parties must be Virginia residents. The seller must be private, and can not be a federally licensed dealer. This is because on a federal level, you must be 21 to own a handgun. However, federal law does not regulate the private sale/trade of firearms. This is regulated by the state, and under Virginia law, an 18 year old may own a handgun, however the only way said 18 year old can acquire one is through private sale or trade. Im willing to fill out/provide any needed info such as BOS and provide two forms of picture ID.

Uncle Sam’s original spec sheet was a one-size fits all. But the 1911-loving public quickly figured out that America’s favorite autoloader could be improved with customization. The Loaded Series from Springfield Armory® brings you the culmination of those lessons. These pistols are Loaded with all the features a 1911 should have.Whether you’re looking for a pistol to use for target practice or home defense, you’ll appreciate the extended ambidextrous thumb safety found on all Loaded 1911s. Likewise, the ergonomic beavertail grip safety, lightweight delta hammer and extended trigger enhance handling and performance in any situation. But not every feature does all jobs, and so the Loaded Series is a diverse lineup. The variety of finishes, frames, calibers and sights means that there is a Loaded 1911 designed to handle your intended application.If you’re ready for a 1911 that brings you upgraded features without a custom shop price tag, look into the Loaded Series.Specifications:Springfield 1911 A1 1911 MIL-SPEC .45ACPFrame :Forged Carbon Steel, Parkerized Grips :Cross Cannon Double Diamond Cocobolo Slide :Forged Carbon Steel, Parkerized Recoil System :2-Piece N.M.

When this gun was new, it was sent to Robar for their Tricon rebuild. They no longer do this rebuild on the M&P but they are doing this on the Glock 19 currently (see second pic). Their price to do this rebuild on YOUR Glock is $1995!! At the time, this rebuild on the M&P was ~$1250. I am sure the price differential is due to them doing a bit more customizing machining on the Glock slide along with inflation.Highlights of this rebuild include machining of the slide to accommodate a Trijicon along with installing one, relocation of the rear sight for co-witness, a trigger job (this one has the best trigger I have ever felt on a polymer gun, a sentiment shared by everyone who has handled it), custom stippling job (even on the extra backstraps) and refinishing the slide in the Robar treatment. All in all, it made this 45C the ultimate in a polymer carry 45.I picked this up on trade, have run about 100 flawless rounds through it and then let it sit in the gunsafe. Time to move it on to someone who will use it and free us some cash for my next project. I realized I am just not a guy who wants an optic on his carry gun.Included with this are the original S&W plastic case with paperwork and spent shell, all the back straps, three 8 rounds mags along with four 14 round mags. Also included is an OWB Minotaur holster (now called the Comp-Tac Gladiator - can look it up on Amazon).Replacement price on this is:M&P 45C           $450Robar Work       $12504 extra mags      $120Holster              $80Total                $1900Priced to move quickly at $1000 firm.

CCW prefered, receipt each way. Would be willing to ship, but you'll cover all the shipping costs and the gun will stay with me long enough to know you have not scammed me. Selling to fund another project. However, I might consider a trade if it was really cool. Also, would entertain gun plus cash from your side. Offer up. Worse I can say is no."

Colt Python .357 Magnum 6"" Vent Rib Barrel, Blue, approximately 90% condition, rubber grips.  Manufactured in 1977.  More pics available upon request.  At the conclusion of the world wars, Colt continued to be at the forefront of innovation. This period saw the introduction of the Commander lightweight semiautomatic pistol, the Cobra lightweight revolvers, the Colt Commemoratives, and what many consider to be the finest revolver ever produced, the famous Colt Python. Another milestone in the history of Colt happened in 1960, when Colt introduced the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, based on the design by Eugene Stoner. It was followed shortly thereafter by the M16 military full automatic version. The involvement of the US in Vietnam again put heavy demands on Colt to supply arms to the troops. To this day, the AR-15 platform continues to be the most popular rifle in the US. The 1970’s also saw many positive changes for Colt. The introduction of the Series ’70 pistols, Sauer Rifles, and the Blackpowder reproductions continued Colt in a positive direction. Additionally, 1976 saw the official beginning of the Colt Custom Shop, expanding its staff of engravers to respond to increasing demand for engraved firearms. The middle of the 1980’s through the middle of the 1990’s were a difficult time in Colt’s history, with the U.S Government replacing the 1911 as the official sidearm of its armed forces and a 4-year strike, however, Colt persevered through these times and introduced new successful models, including the Double Eagle double action pistol, the Anaconda, and a redesigned Sporter Rifle."

This means, you give me your slide, and I will give you my slide with the items listed above.  So basically, you're paying for the DeltaPoint Pro, the rear iron sight and the front sight, etc. All parts were purchased brand new. If you actually look up the prices for those items, you will see that my price is pretty much the same as if you were to go buy the parts yourself. Why did I do this?  Because I did not like the Romeo 1 due to that fact that you can't co-witness the iron sight. Yes the Romeo 1 has somewhat of a dovetail in the rear, but it's a joke. The Leupold DeltaPoint Pro is the only sight that offers a rear rear iron sight, but it's footprint is slightly longer in length than the Romeo 1. The rear is exactly the same, so I had to shave a couple mm from the front. I have photos of how much was taken off so you can see how well the work was done. There was a lot of trials and errors in trying to find what would fit perfectly. But I did it and the sight has been boresighted and the front and rear sights are properly co-witnessed. Please text me: (28l) 773- 82 SlX NlNE"
