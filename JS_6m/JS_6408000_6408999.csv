It comes with two barrels (the original .40 cal barrel and a conversion barrel from S3F Solutions so you can shoot 9mm) and it comes with a Jpoint red dot optic. So if you install the conversion barrel you essentially have a Glock 19 upper. This slide will fit a Glock 23 and Glock 19 frame. 
 
Here are the modifications:
- slide cuts to include: all edges chamferred, front serrations, top serrations and an optic cut to perfectly fit the Jpoint.
- S3F 9mm conversion barrel coated in Black Nitride and has flutes - this thing is super accurate and only has about 50 rounds through it
- Original .40 cal barrel (has about 600 rounds through it - not pictured)
- Jpoint optic from JP Rifles
- Suppressor height sights (although they aren't needed with the Jpoint, you can run standard height sights with the Jpoint)
- Cerakote MADLand Camo from MAD Custom Coating. They are probably the best Cerakote shop around. They have a lifetime guarantee.
- The slide DOES NOT come with: internal parts including the recoil spring/guide rodWill ship. Contact me if you have questions 714-35O-7593"

A patented downward ejection system makes it truly ambidextrous, while its 26.1 inch overall length, 18.5 inch cylinder bore barrel and 6.9lbs of weight make it is as compact as legally possible.MSRP: $990.00Mine has had exactly 13 rounds through it, cleaned and then put back in its case. I love the idea of this gun, but there are a few other things I need before I repurchase one of these zombie killers.

The obvious change is that I had a professional gunsmith add a bobtail to the grip. The bobtail works perfectly with this size of 1911. After I had the gunsmith install the bobtail, I had a professional cerakote the slide, frame, and controls. The slide and frame were cerakoted in sniper grey. It gives it a very classic 1911 look. A cerakote is perfect for this gun because Kimber 1911's are known for not having very excellent factory finishes. I am an honset seller, so please believe me when I tell you this gun has never malfunctioned on me. Everytime I pressed the trigger, the gun went off. This included a fair amount of hallowpoints. Items included will be one factory Kimber magazine (7 rounds), one Wilson combat magazine (8 rounds), a cant adjustable IWB holster, and of course the factory box.If you would like a high quality 1911 that you can rely on, please consider this one!DISCALIMER: I am not accepting trades. Do not contact me if you have a criminal record. I live in Kansas and I expect you to as well. If you live in MO, then we will go to a dealer and make the transaction there. CCW holders preferred."

An interesting design aspect of the PX4 is that unlike most pistols on the market, the barrel does not tilt down to unlock from the slide, but rotates instead. Due to the magic of physics and conservation of momentum, recoil forces are dispersed radially, in part, reducing the amount of felt recoil to the shooter. Combined with the mechanical disadvantage prior to slide travel created by the hammer, the PX4 is a surprisingly soft shooting pistol. Comes with two magazines, interchangeable backstraps, and cleaning brushes.

Pistons are constructed from 17-4 stainless steel and then heat treated for maximum durability. The piston is part of the Nielsen device that moves and allows semi-automatic cycling, but it also contains the female threads that attach to the muzzle of the host pistol or sub-gun. These pistons are easily interchangeable for compatibility with all relevant host guns and can be changed out to be compatible with subcaliber host guns, which means you can shoot smaller caliber rounds through the same suppressor, making it a multi-caliber silencer.These pistons are compatible with the following suppressors: Octane seriesOsprey seriesHybridOmega K series"

It comes with the ""alligator box"", the original manual in English and German, the 2 original magazines, and a holster that I think is a modified Makarov holster but it looks pretty close. As near as I can tell it appears to be a commercial pistol from the late '60's or early '70's, but I really can't pin it down. The lanyard ring confuses me a little but too. It was Made in West Germany and imported by C.D.I., Swan VT. (That is NOT Century Arms!). The bluing is really nice and shiny with a few holster wear spots, and it has a bright shiny bore as well. I was at the range with a bunch of friends and won lots of money with this. We put clay pidgeons out at 200yds for rifle shooting when one of them offered me 3 shots to hit it with this PP. It only took 2! If you have questions or want to make an offer, please let me know!"

Born of necessity, raised in the Army’s Marksmanship Unit and refined to Daniel Defense Mil-Spec+ standards, it is now available. The MK12 is constructed around an 18-inch Stainless Steel barrel with a chamber created during the Cold Hammer Forging process, which ensures the most precise alignment of the chamber to the bore possible. This, along with being salt bath nitride finished, equates to unprecedented accuracy and durability. The MK12 barrel is engineered with a rifle-length direct impingement gas system and utilizes the MK12 gas block, which is built to Crane Specifications for USSOCOM. The MK12 gas block is precision CNC machined from 416 stainless steel and Black Oxide Coated. The rifle is fed with a M16 profile bolt carrier group and uses a Vltor Mod 4 charging handle for ease of operation. The upper receiver is equipped with a free floating DDM4 Rail 12.0™ quad rail for allowing your choice of optics and accessories and is finished off with a Daniel Defense Improved Flash Suppressor. The MK12 was designed from the ground up to be a precision rifle, therefore it required certain refinements. We equipped it with the Geissele SSA® 2-Stage Trigger to give the marksman an advantage delivering precise fire to the target. We also furnished the MK12 with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

The LW has identical features to the V5 and costs the same too, but the difference is the LW has a lightweight barrel, which cuts a third of a pound. The LW uses the Omega X Rail 12 handguards. These handguards are free-floating, so when the barrel heats up and swells they won’t press against each other. It has Picatinny rails running along the top, bottom and sides, which allow for easy mounting of optics or accessories. The top runs continuously and meets with the upper receiver and extends slightly after the front sight. But it is available with fixed sight, flip sights or not sights. It has a mid-length gas operating system, so propellant gases are caught in a tube near the muzzle, the tube guides it back to the bolt and then catches in another tube on the bolt. When the gas is caught, it drives the bolt back. This delays recoil until the projectile has left the bore. Mid-length means that the gas is caught after a medium distance in the barrel, so less pressure is used to push the bolt back (compared to the short-length gas system). Features include a chrome lined bore, a vertical fore-grip, a MagPul buttstock that’s lightweight and adjustable, a cold hammer forged barrel, so a machine carefully carved the grooves in the bore. This process produces accurate and durable rifling. And it has a sling swivel attachment points, so users can attach a combat sling, which allows them to sling it while carrying it at the ready. Daniel Defense recommends the LW for military, law enforcement or personal security. Manufacturer: Daniel Defense Model: 02-123-16029-047 DDM4V5LW Condition: New Caliber/Gauge: 5.56 NATO"

While it's a full-size gun in every sense, those looking for a carry pistol will find that the grip length and shape helps the gun conceal surprisingly well, and if carried inside the waistband (IWB) the long barrel length will present no issue.

AK-based design and construction of the rifles provides a reliable operation of parts and mechanisms as well as high-grade shooting in various weather and climatic conditions. Its extra heavy duty receiver and hammer-forged barrel provide much better accuracy and durability. A chrome-lined barrel with chrome-lined chamber and bore along with walnut stocks make these rifles very different from other AK-based rifles available in the US market The rifles come with adjustable open sighting devices and a rail for a scope mount attached to the left side of the receiver. This allows for shooting from the rifle with an open sight without taking away a riflescope. All VEPR rifles go through a robust quality control and inspection and each new rifle has its own quality control acceptance certification from the factory, included in the manual."
