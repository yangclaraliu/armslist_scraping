I have a Springfield XD-S 3.3'' in .45 ACP for sale. I'm also including a great IWB/OWB holster that I bought from Gavin Hodge. His site may be down but there are a lot of great reviews on firearm forums for his holsters. Just google ""Gavin Hodge Holsters"". I recommend them to everyone. I also put an aftermarket Pearce Grip pinkie extension on one of the magazines (the original mag base plate is included). I've only put about 250 rounds through it. I'm only selling it because I carry a full size now and my XD-S just collects dust in my safe.
 Contents include
-Gavin Hodge IWB/OWB holster
-Original hard case
-Original OWB paddle holster
-Original magazine (2) paddle carrier
-2 five round magazines
-2interchangable back-straps
-firearm lock
I live in the Bothell/Kirkland area. We can meet a local firearm dealer who will do the FFL transfer. Ill be happy to split the cost of the FFL with you. Thanks for taking a look and don't hesitate to reach out with any questions!"

This infrared Scope was first manufactured in 1943 for use in the Pacific against the Japanese forces and was used in Korea and Vietnam until 1968. The case is in perfect condition as well as the scope. I cannot say that it works because I have not powered it up. The Battery has never had any acid in it. The set is missing the transformer that converts 6 volts from the battery to 20,000 to power the optical tube. The set is also missing the power cable that connects the transformer to the Infrared Scope. The scope has all the correct cables. The Lens is in perfect condition without any cracks or imperfections. The set is also missing the tool pouch which is very hard to find and some miscellaneous small spare parts. There are extra parts. There is a spare battery that has been converted to a 6 volt solid state battery. There is a new trigger assembly that is still in its original box and the upper hand guard required to mount the infrared scope on a M1/M2 carbine. There are also two extra elevation cams that are very hard to find. There is also an original TM5-9342 manual, that is also hard to find.

This is assumed to be a factory test fired only rifle due to no carbon anywhere on the piston and the overall condition. However, I am not the original owner so pics are below for you to make your own determination. It has a couple safe bumps/scuffs, but that's it. The finish still has that fantastic Valmet sparkle in it that most no longer have. The sister to this rifle, 2 serial numbers higher, currently resides in the NRA museum. Less than 50 total M76's in x39 were imported in 1988. This wood stock is the most comfortable if you do plan on ever firing it of the 3 styles imported. There were about 20 of the wood stock rifles brought in. Not sure exactly where milled vs stamped falls into the equation exactly but I do know that the milled rifles are far more rare than the stamped. It has the Fiskars bayonet and a lanyard loop mag included. This may be the only chance in your lifetime that you have the chance to own one of these in this condition. This rifle is being sold at no reserve. Shipping will obviously be done to your FFL for a flat fee of $150. If that sounds excessive to you do not bid. It will be over packaged, due to the rarity of what we are dealing with here, and insured for the full value of the closing bid. As for payments, I will only accept USPS money orders or wire transfer. I realize that you will have to buy multiple money orders and again if this bothers you, do not bid. These terms will not be changed. If you have any questions, just ask. I can and will be more than happy to contact you by phone if that makes you more comfortable"

The gun has an Italian M1891 action, modified to take a Mauser (Arisaka design) magazine chambered for the 6.5mmx50SR (SemiRimfire) Japanese cartridge. About 60,000 of these Italian rifles were ordered by Japan's navy in 1937 when all of Japan's Type 38 Arisaka rifles were reserved for the army. More than 60,000 Italian rifles were delivered but many were warehoused unused or were lost on IJN ships. Those captured or surrendered at the end of WW II were in very good condition. Produced primarily by Beretta, the rifle was designated by the Italians as the ""Beretta Fucile Tipo I per L'esportazione,"" which, roughly translated means ""Beretta Rifle Type I for Export."" The serial number of this particular gun is F7821, the F prefix identifying it as having been made by Beretta at Italy's Gardone Arsenal. Students of both Italian and Japanese World War II rifles have found much to admire in the Type I, noting that the chambers were cut to much closer tolerances, making the gun more accurate than the Japanese-made Arisaka. Another plus, the action is a full inch shorter and lighter than the Japanese adaptation of the Mauser design, with a fit and finish conforming to the highest standards of pre-war Beretta workmanship. This rifle does not have its original military stock but a sporterised one of quality wood with a recoil pad. It makes for a fine hunting rifle on deer-sized game. The gun comes with a complete set of RCBS reloading dies, including shell holder, and four boxes of ammo, two with 139gr Norma boattails and two with 140gr Hornady SP. Bullet weights for the 6.5mm (.264 inches) range from 120gr SP to Norma's 156gr round nose ""Alaska."" But most reloaders believe 156gr is too heavy for the 6.5mm round, favoring weights between 129-140 grains."

I just forgot to remove it from the butt stock for display when I took the photos. 
Other than the stock and magazine cover, all serial numbers are original.  The magazine cover’s original serial number has a line through it, with the new serial number (that matches all of the other parts) just above it.  The butt stock has 2 serial numbers that are overwritten with Xs and a third one that matches all of the other parts.  The bolt cover has the Tula star and a date of 1952.  It believe the stock is solid artic birch and not a laminate.It's getting very hard to find these in unused/unfired condition and especially with all of the original accessories & box.More photos available by request."

The first true subpact in Sig Sauer's classic all-metal firearms line, the P224 is ideal for concealed or off-duty carry featuring all of the features that you would expect from Sig Sauer.
 
Based on the 229, the P224 takes advantage of the hammer-fire reliability and lightweight all-metal frame and puts them in a subcompact package with all of Sig Sauer's familiar controls and functions.
 
In spite of its small size, the P224 maintains a double-stack magazine for a higher capacity of 9mm than those in firearms of its size, at 12+1 rounds of 9mm the P224 has a distinct advantage over most of its subcompact competitors. With that advantage, the new model P229 magazines can also be used to give the P224 an even greater round count.
 
The P224 is an excellent choice for those who are familiar with the P229 manual of arms, with all the controls and operation of the P226 and P229 being the same in the P224.
 
The SIG Anti-Snag (P224 SAS) model features a de-horned slide and frame, with the new ergonomically enhanced one-piece grip. The P224 SAS comes standard with SIGLITE Night Sights in the Nitron coated slide model.

They all agreed it was 100% safe and in working order, but advised for me to use a low powder round, so not to do any damage to the gun or its value. The 44-40 round was so that the indivdual, most likely a cowboy, would only have to carry one sized round for his pistol and rifle. Still a large enough round to make a devastating impact.

I've decided to carry a bigger gun so I don't need her anymore. This gun was purchased 6 months ago and has about 500 round through it. I had a couple FTF in the first 100 rounds, so it made a trip back to the factory and got a new extractor and magazines. Since then, it has been 100% with FMJ and HP. Along with the gun are some great holsters from F3, KRounds, and Desantis, as well as an extended mag. I'm looking to trade for something cool, like an LCR in .357, and SP101, or another small revolver. Let me know what you have, and the worst that can happen is a polite ""no thank you.""Want to just buy it? Cool - $385 and you pay the transfer fee. Thanks!"
