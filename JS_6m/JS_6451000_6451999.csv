The SPR variant is one of our most popular models. Constructed using the highest quality materials, built on our patented self-regulating short-stroke gas piston system, machined from materials that belong to the super alloy family of steel alloys most often used in aerospace, LWRCI™ raises the bar on reliability and ease of maintenance- delivering the highest level of performance. The gas-piston system can be accessed quickly by loosening two thumb screws.The SPR with one-piece Monoforge™ upper design includes an integrated rail-base that is stronger and lighter. The 12” user configurable rail system with individual rail sections allow the shooter to place accessory rails where they are needed while maintaining its low profile ergonomic fit and function. Lower receiver includes bolt catch and release, magazine release and fire control access from both sides of the SPR. LWRCI™ Enhanced Fire Control Group comes standard but this gun was upgraded to a Magpul ACS stock with the little storage compartment. All LWRC castings are x-rayed for imperfections and nickel-boron coated for a smooth crisp trigger pull with positive reset. The trigger feels like an aftermarket and has a clean break for factory.The SPR uses LWRCI  NiCorr treated cold Hammer Forged spiral fluted barrel that are 20% lighter than unfluted barrels of the same diameter. The increased surface area reduces heat – speeds up cooling. Nickel-boron coated bolt carrier delivers unparalleled wear resistance, corrosion resistance and permanent lubricity.

The finish has a deep black mirror finish to it that these are so well known for. There is a trace of holster wear at the very front right of the barrel. You will notice a very fine secondary line on the cylinder. This is caused by the cylinder being rotated when the sideplate screw is backed out slightly. The sideplate screw is fully turned in currently and is not touching the cylinder. Besides these two issues there is just very slight handling and the finish rates a solid 97%. The action is crisp, the lock up is tight, and the bore is bright and shiny. The grips are a little long where they meet at the butt so they have been replaced. Overall a very solid example of a highly sought after Python."

Pmag.  This is a new unfired rifle that I never got around to doing anything with because of other projects.  I chose this particular AR-10 because I wanted a bit more range than a 16"" barrel would give and the medium contour barrel keeps the rifle as light as possible without compromising accuracy.  After looking over lots of ballistic data I saw no reason to go with a 20"" barrel, IMO the gain in velocity was simply not worth the extra length and weight.  Again, the rifle is new but it was purchased around three years ago, the only one I could find currently listed was one on Gunbroker for $1,650 in the same configuration.  I do have aftermarket pistol grips and stocks I can add for a little extra, just let me know.
$1,300 firm in cash or better in trade.  This one cost well over $1,500 after tax and it's still new.  
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and shorter in 9mm and .45 ACP and cash or??  If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.
Must be able to own a firearm in TX.  I can ship insured to another TX resident for $30 more.
Thanks for looking!"

Pmag.  This is a new unfired rifle that I never got around to doing anything with because of other projects.  I chose this particular AR-10 because I wanted a bit more range than a 16"" barrel would give and the medium contour barrel keeps the rifle as light as possible without compromising accuracy.  After looking over lots of ballistic data I saw no reason to go with a 20"" barrel, IMO the gain in velocity was simply not worth the extra length and weight.  Again, the rifle is new but it was purchased around three years ago, the only one I could find currently listed was one on Gunbroker for $1,650 in the same configuration.  I do have aftermarket pistol grips and stocks I can add for a little extra, just let me know.
$1,300 firm in cash or better in trade.  This one cost well over $1,500 after tax and it's still new.  
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and shorter in 9mm and .45 ACP and cash or??  If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.

Pmag.  This is a new unfired rifle that I never got around to doing anything with because of other projects.  I chose this particular AR-10 because I wanted a bit more range than a 16"" barrel would give and the medium contour barrel keeps the rifle as light as possible without compromising accuracy.  After looking over lots of ballistic data I saw no reason to go with a 20"" barrel, IMO the gain in velocity was simply not worth the extra length and weight.  Again, the rifle is new but it was purchased around three years ago, the only one I could find currently listed was one on Gunbroker for $1,650 in the same configuration.  I do have aftermarket pistol grips and stocks I can add for a little extra, just let me know.
$1,300 firm in cash or better in trade.  This one cost well over $1,500 after tax and it's still new.  
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and shorter in 9mm and .45 ACP and cash or??  If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.
Must be able to own a firearm in TX.  I can ship insured to another TX resident for $30 more.
Thanks for looking!"

I did make one upgrade to the rifle. It now uses the hitech magazine conversion which can be found on rifletech.com. the magazine's are 125 each new. Best thing about doing this style conversion is you can switch it back by re moving the adapter. So there is no permanent changes to the gun. One thing I love about these mags is they cycle great with no problems.iused to have a lot of problems out of the aftermarket magazines in the SKS.

This is their ""flyweight"" barrel with a thread protector (NO FLASH HIDER). Upper receiver, lower receiver & handguard are all cerakoted green!Compact, accurate and completely trustworthy, the REC7 is designed specifically for situations in which there’s no room for error. Styled in the familiar AR configuration, it’s a no-nonsense rifle you can trust with anything—including your life.This tough-as-nails rifle was designed specifically to answer the call for a low-maintenance, enhanced reliability carbine.The REC7 rifle’s dependability stems largely from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts, the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean, reducing maintenance requirements and increasing endurance.The patented chrome-lined fluted gas block prevents excessive carbon buildup from operation under adverse conditions. The one-piece 17-4 stainless piston transfers energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel, the carrier features an integral piston strike face.The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high-strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7, not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt’s gas-ring-free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance.At the heart of the operating system is a nitrided, two-position, forward-venting gas plug that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the front of the gas block without removing the handguard so optical sights or laser devices do not need to be zeroed after routine maintenance.The REC7 rifle’s forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are Type 3 Class 2 hardcoat anodized and Cerakote finished. The lower houses an ultra-dependable single-stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated, hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrel with M4 feed ramps machined into the receiver and the barrel extension."
