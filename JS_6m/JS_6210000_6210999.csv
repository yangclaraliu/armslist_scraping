Comes with 2 magazines.
 Century Arms did an outstanding job on this particular rifle, as it is fitted nicely and the finish is great – a nice, gray Parkerizing over all the metal parts.
Rear sight is a peep-style and can be adjusted from 200 to 600 yards.  But it shoots accurately well beyond 600 yards.   Gun is capable of shooting far better than this shooter can shoot!This trigger pull is outstanding for a military style rifle and breaks at even 5 lbs.Muzzle brand/flash suppressor really helps control the recoil.
Adjustable gas regulator! Adjust it to fit the ammo you are using or your personal preference. You can close the gas regulator down, if you need more gas, to make the gun operate properly, or open the gas regulator up as well. Or you can shut the gas regulator completely off for firing grenade launching blanks.
With a wide variety of ammo for this gun out there, you can tailor the gun to function at it’s best with whatever ammo you’re shooting.
Legendary reliability, robustness and performance in combat made this gun the battle rifle of dozens of countries."

I ordered this barrel back before the whole LBC.264 Alexander Arms chamber issue. So this barrel has a rare original cut true 6.5 Grendel Chamber. The barrel was ordered as a 30"" but is actually closer to a 28"" barrel. I also paid extra to have the barrel fluted. I've shot exactly 348 rounds down this barrel. I know because I have kept every peace of brass that came out of it. I've only used factory 123 grain hornady amax rounds as recommended by satern. The barrel will routinely shoot 1/2"" groups with the Amax's. I've went to a satern 6.5 creedmoor setup so I no longer need the Grendel barrel. This is one awesome Grendel barrel. Just google Satern 6.5 Grendel and read the reviews. Satern makes one of the best custom cut barrels out there.

The Full Length Sizer Die features a Zip Spindle, with a series of light threads cut on the spindle and spindle collet. This eliminates spindle slippage, and makes tightening the spindle lock a breeze when making adjustments. The floating bullet alignment sleeve and stem in the CGND Seating Die improve bullet seating and accuracy by pre-aligning the bullet and case before seating. The seating die also applies a roll crimp to secure the bullet in the case. The CGND die set comes packaged in a plastic storage box, and includes two Sure-Loc rings. Shellholder is sold separately.

Comes with the box, 2 mags, factory hammer Spring and paperwork regarding everything done to it. It has been a safe queen for me, only coming out occasionally to be shot. I've probably only put a few hundred rounds thru it in the 3 or 4 years I've owned it. Right now I'm looking only to trade it. I will consider a Shield in 45acp plus accessories/cash/ammo to make up the difference, Glock 30s plus accessories/cash/ammo to make up the difference, Glock 43 plus accessories/cash/ammo to make up the difference, an FNX-45 tactical, or a nice commander or compact sized 1911. I can add some cash or ammo to make up the difference for a 1911 or FNX-45 I really like. I would also consider a 9mm compact caliber exchange kit for a Sig P320 in FDE as a partial trade that could be added in with the Glock or Shield or a Ruger LCR in .357. I put the trade value at $700 but am negotiable for the right trade. At this time I am not considering selling it."

787,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6210787,For Sale:  Graham Defense BCG (yes it IS gold),"Northside, San Antonio, Texas",FREE,"Listed On: Friday, December 30, 2016",Gun,Saiga                                                                                ,7.62x39                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Hey folks I am letting go of a Top Quality Competition BCG manufactured by Graham Defense. The reason this BCG is gold in color is due to the Finish. It's called Titanium Nitride (TiN), and is one step above Nickle Boron (NiB) in both price and durabillity. TiN has a little less Lubricity than NiB but lasts longer and also handles higher heat MUCH better. I am going to list several of the BCG finishes in order from cheapest and highest wear-rate to most expensive and lowest wear-rate. Hard Chrome: the military used this for a while because the chrome had a natural lubricity characteristic which allowed the bolt to run very smooth. However, the chrome finish would begin to flake off the bolt would lose that desired ""smoothness.""Phosphate: These BCG's are by far the most popular on the market and the most cost efficient. They are the current military standard due to High Durability. But just being ""Mil-Spec"" doesn't mean that it holds ALL of the best characteristics. It's primary advantage is high durability, but being that it doesn't have a very smooth finish, the action will have a more noticeable ""grind"" and drag to it and it will also increase chamber temperatures. These bolts are also VERY tough to clean and the outer finish is rough.Black Nitride: This treament is one step above Phosphate because it sports a glossy finish and is more wear-resistent. It is more common with barrels so as to improve barrel life, and is much easier to clean than Parkerized treatments used on the Phosphate BCG's.Nickel Boron (NiB): This finish is highly desired amongst the tactical scene as it looks good in any rifle build, is highly lubricious, and is extremely easy to clean. It's drawbacks though, are that the coating becomes dicolored (gets daker and looses luster) after moderate use, and will eventually flake off reducing some of its lubricious qualities.Titanium Nitride (TiN): This treament can in some cases be one of the more expensive options (but not always the MOST) when is comes to buying a High-End BCG. Its main perks are that it is Highly wear-resistent, can stand up to extreme temperatures (moreso than the former options listed), and is Highly Lubricious. This treament does NOT become discolored after use like the Nickle Boron varieties. The only option on the market that Beats the TiN treatment in Lubricity is the NP3 (Electroless Nickle) treatment, often confused with Nickle Boron. NP3 is a metal treatment and NOT a coating wich Allows it to maintain high lubricity. However, NP3 BCG's tend to be the MOST expensive on the market. These are not ""opinions"" people, these are Studies and Scientific Facts, so please Spare me your ""Hate Mail"" claiming that phosphate is the ""best"" on the market. People want differemt products for different reasons, these are merely the Factual properties of each option.I WILL advise against having the TiN treament done to an existing BCG, though. Simply becasue the ones that come from the factory are made to diffferent dimensional specifications that allow extra room for the thick outer treament. The factory TiN BCG's are also comprised of alloyed steel that bonds properly with the TiN treatement, eliminating the flaking that happens with other coatings.If you get a phosphate bcg aftermarket caoted, you will most likely not experince the smoother lubricity as you have added a layer of extra material making the fitment inside the upper receiver MUCH tighter, wich will ultimately slow the action and wear the new BCG coating as well as the inside of your upper receiver. You definitely do not want that. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaalrighty then, let's get down to the nitty-gritty. My BCG here has seen and properly ran 300 rounds. Graham Defense does NOT mass produce a SINGLE item and carefully precision machines and thuroughly inspects ALL of their items before giving them the stamp of approval. Everything they manufacture is built for Competition conditions where Failure is NOT an option. Think of this Awesome BCG as fine Small batch whisky. You Certainly get what you pay for when it comes this guy and quite honestly, most things in life.My price is $160 FIRM as these retail for $225 + shipping. I will NOT take less. I am not looking to trade at this time. if youre interested, please feel free to message me night or day. REDACTED"
