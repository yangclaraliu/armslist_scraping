Never fired. Has a few small scratches across the top, otherwise mint. Superb grip and trigger. More photos available upon request. Armslist limits you to three.One aspect that's a little different about the VP is its magazine release, which is on either side of the trigger guard, which is common in Germany but unusual here. That said, I've really gotten to like it. It's really handy, doesn't get in the way, and I've never hit it accidentally. My 2 cents.What's included:- night sights- interchangable side and rear panels; IMO, this gives the VP the best grip out there right now. A stock Glock feels like gripping a two-by-four, by comparison. The VP really conforms to your hand.- 3 magazines, 13 round- case, manual, sticker, trigger lock, etc.Price is firm. New, these (with night sights) go for $675-$700.I'll provide a bill of sale."

The original owner who sold it to me stated it was only test fired which it was. What he failed to tell me was the last shell would not load which is what I noticed when I test fired it.(yea I'm talking to you Joe).  I called Mossberg and it turns out this gun was shipped with the 22 inch spring not the 24 inch. Mossberg sent me the correct spring and the gun now functions flawlessly( ogiginal spring is still in box). I bought it to possibly get into 3 gun but I never did. Since shooting this gun to test the spring it was cleaned and put on my rack where it has remained. condition is excellent with no scratches or issues. As always all laws apply.. I prefer face to face. Please call/text three three zero-559- seven four zero zero with offers and or questions as I dont check email as pften as I should.

It was rediscovered recently by his wife, who claims after purchasing it he 'messed with it a few times' but never fired it. This certainly appears to be the case. I can't find any evidence it's been shot, carried or left anywhere but a closet. The bluing and grip are in immaculate condition, no chips or scratches. What appears to be wear on the ridge of the upper grip is a reflection on the glossy finish of the wood - it is not actual wear. It includes two HKS speed loaders and a soft case. Unfortunately the original case is nowhere to be found, although I do have the manual. Mostly interested in trades at this point, cash price $800 OBO. Trade interests:+/- cash for the right offer.
