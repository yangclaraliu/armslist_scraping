Its plenty accurate even as a small gun and perfoms very well.

It also has two mags one of which has a Hyve Tech +2 mag extension and the other has just the pinky extension(no added rounds to the mag). Comes with stock sights.

Both pistols have a snag-proof design that permits quick presentation to the target, a slide blade front sight for fast target acquisition, and a smooth, crisp trigger pull in double/single action. The same dedication to advanced design, uncompromising quality and strict quality control that make the 92FS, Cougar and Cheetah such international standouts is found in all Beretta small caliber, pocket-size pistols. Simplicity, safety and practical use are their best qualities. The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by allowing a live round to be easily removed from the chamber and the bore quickly checked. Jamming and stovepiping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design shared by all small frame Berettas.

This shotgun comes in OK, Working, Pre-Owned Condition. It comes with moderate to heavy signs of wear/tear, which can be attributed to the fact that it was previously owned, saw regular or above average usage, and was not well taken care of. There are numerous light scratches and scrapes in the wood stock, as well as a couple of small chips, or dings, though there are no cracks, or gouges. This shotgun's barrel, and receiver have some kind of discoloration in addition to a fair number of scratches, and scrapes, as well as some minor rusting, and pitting. This shotgun's receiver is beautifull etched with a scene of hunting dogs, but this can be difficult to see due to it's condition. This is a nice unique gun that would be a great addition to any collection. And if you would like to see more photo's of this firearm, simply contact us!"
