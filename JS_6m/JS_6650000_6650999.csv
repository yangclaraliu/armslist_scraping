Building on the lauded submachinegun platform that first hit the US civilian market in pistol form in 2015, the Carbine has a 16.2″ barrel fitted with either a compensating muzzle brake or a faux suppressor built specifically for CZ-USA by SilencerCo.Fit with the factory’s folding adjustable stock, the Carbine features a number of US-made parts to make it fully 922(r) compliant. One of the nicest features of the firearm is the newly-designed forend, covered in M-LOK attachment points to keep the profile slim while still being big enough to swallow most pistol-caliber suppressors should the owner decide down the road to convert it into an SBR for use with a suppressor.Low-profile aluminum adjustable sights round out the platform, and a top Picatinny rail allows the mounting of a wide number of optics. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable."

Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. With a heavy first-round trigger pull, any additional shots are a light, crisp single action.The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to the rest of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well.These upgrades mean the components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangeable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting needed. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired.With an integral 1913 accessory rail on its dust cover, the P-01 easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist with low-light use.After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.Reliability: The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may or may not carry an NSN."

I acquired the rifle a couple years ago from a gentleman who inherited it during the liquidation of his father's estate, and to his knowledge the rifle was either not fired, or had only been fired a few times.  Since owning it, I have not shot it either, so it remains in the same pristine condition. 
Email me for photos of the rifle, or if you have any questions.  Asking $800.00, or best reasonable offer.  No trade offers, please."

Here's what Remington sez about this rifle.
Remington Model 597. 22 Long Rifle Semi-Automatic/Black Barrel & Synthetic Stock
The fastest, smoothest, slickest, most advanced rimfire rifle you've ever put a shoulder to. And the rate it zips out rounds is rivaled only by the speed of its advancement. Not only that, the Model 597 continues to lead in auto-loading rimfire out-of-the-box accuracy and reliability.
Twin tool-steel bolt-guidance bars make the Model 597 one of the fastest, most reliable and accurate semiautomatic rimfire rifles available. The bolt, hammer and sear are nickel-Teflon® plated for smooth operation and a crisp trigger pull in all conditions. The barrel and receiver attach with a positive-locking system that guarantees perfect alignment and enhanced accuracy. On the last shot, the bolt locks open for visual clear-chamber safety. Matte-finish barrel, receiver and stock. Receiver is grooved and drilled/tapped to accept a variety of scope-mounting options. A non-glare, synthetic stock pairs with the matte-finish barrel for a classic look that won't spook game. Adjustable iron sights hold up to rough field use.
The Model 597 features a bolt guidance system with twin tool steel guide rods, non glare matte finish, patented 10 shot metal detachable magazine, and a last shot ""hold open"" bolt for added safety.
