I also upgraded to a springfield flat wire recoil set up so it can be taken down with a paperclip now instead of trying to keep track of little plastic pieces. Will come with 2 factory mags, as well as the holster, mag carrier, and all the paperwork it comes with.The reason it's a project is because it needs a new extractor installed and tuned. It currently ejects forward at about the 2 o'clock position. A new extractor will only cost about $40 but I just don't have the time or energy to tune it these days.Will skip the back and forth on the price this time. $450 is the lowest I'll go.

I'm asking $105 for all 442 rounds which is 23.7 cents per round. See the trade list for what I would be interested in trading for. I will only sell/trade the entire lot at one time, so please don't ask for one or two packs.  I'm located about a few miles from Kings Island and will drive up to 30 minutes for a trade. I also have a lot of once shot brass in multiple calibers that I could throw in to the right trade as well as other gun related items. You can text me anytime at 513-2Nine5-1SevenSix6, NO Calls.

The leather sling and the detailed NRA American Rifleman reprint ""The Springfield Story""  by Dr. Thomas E. Mott are included. These U. S. Rifle, Cal. .22 M2 rifles were the final type of cal.22 rimfire target rifles regularly manufactured at Sprinfield Armory (per page 16 of the reprint). There was an experimental T1 cal. .22 rifle designed by John C. Garand as the forerunner to the final Cal. .22 M2 rifle.

Comes with a winchester textured synthetic stock which feels solid, not like the cheap replacement stocks out there. It also comes with the wood stock however it has a lot of wear on it. Included are the leupold steel bases/rings. I have not personally shot it because I got it in a package deal and don't have any spare 270 win ammo laying around. Serial number puts it from 1979. I believe it is the push round feed version. Nice light gun in really nice shape. No shipping unless you want to add $40 to cover the cost."
