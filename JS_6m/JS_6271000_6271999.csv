Parts to make them are rarely in stock on the battle arms website and complete rifles with all battle arms parts are even less common. I received this rifle in a trade from the original owner who hadn't shot it yet and I put at most 200 rounds through it. I don't shoot it enough and don't have time to so that's why I'm selling it. If you have specific questions about anything please feel free to text me. Accessories include a Trijicon MRO with the Battle Arms mount and a Surefire x400 light/laser combo and Magpul MBUS flip-up sights. The price listed only includes the flip-ups. The surefire and trijicon can be added on for a total of $3500 . Separately for sale I also have roughly 500 rounds of Federal 223 FMJ which can also be included for an extra fee.

You could hear a queef while with this is on.My son has one of these puppies set up for Win10, and has impressed his spoiled ass. He can play GTAV in the highest settings without frame drops or issues....whatever the hell that means. And don't judge my parenting for letting my son play 'violent games'. I'm getting him acclimated to being able to defend himself without his feelings getting in the way.Here are some details on the specs for the system:Intel Core i7 - 4765T Quad Core.nVidia GeForce GTX GPU w/2GB GDDR5.8GB DDR3.1TB 7200RPM HDD.Steam Controller.Now to the gravy. Obviously I have two of these. So the one in the box is good for trade. I am willing to humor offers in the 9 or the 556 category. Feel free to send pics and tell me about your toy. I love good gun porn. If a cost difference is warranted, I'm easy like that. I paid over $400 for this sucker, and I'm pretty sure the value hasn't gone down after pulling off the lot. So please use good judgement. And if you would like Windows 10 installed, just ask. Or I can set you up with the OS on a USB drive, and you can do it if and when you want."

Outstanding pistol for home defense, range, truck, etc. (at 35 ounces a bit heavy for everyday carry). I love this pistol, but the CZ-inspired slide-inside-frame design leaves less area to grip when racking the slide, and my arthritic hands are having trouble with it, so it has to go; would never sell it otherwise. I’ve fired exactly 250 rounds (200 FMJ and 50 Hornady 230-grain JHP), and that weight makes it the softest recoiling .45 I’ve ever shot, plus it’s extremely accurate. No shipping, no trades; will meet in/near Chattanooga."

This model will come with Ghost Ring Sights, Black Synthetic Stock, Pistol Grip, and the Benelli Comfortech stock shown. The Comfortech Stock alone is a $300 value. The feed port has been modified for rapid reloading, and the weapon comes equipped with the TTI AccuGuide extended carrier, and Ultimate Charging handle; this eases rapid reloading and cocking of the shotgun during both competition or high-stress situations. This purchase will include all equipment listed above and the installed standard 18.5"" barrel, and the 5+1 standard magazine tube. This is a fantastic deal and besides some minor and normal signs of use the only other mark on the gun is a minor tool mark near the loading port. Overall this weapon is in excellent condition with only 75 rounds fired all with no failures of any kind.This shotgun fires both the 2 3/4 and 3 inch, 12 gauge shells and does well with both low and high brass.Note: I am willing to ship out of state. However, any form of payment besides cash will result in the weapon being held at a local FFL until I can confirm the payment before shipping ( had a forged check mailed to me recently and I was lucky I had not shipped the weapon before my bank notified me it was fake).I am looking to sell and any reasonable offer will be considered ;feel free to communicate.Blacked out area on photo is just for security of the serial number..."

The interior doesn't show any signs of a gun ever being put in it. This is a Hard case that is covered with Canvas Olive Green with Leather accents. Designed for Double barrel (like Superposed or Citori) or Trap guns (like BT99 and BT100). The exterior of the case is 34"" long. The barrel storage part of the interior measures 32.5"" long. There are a couple of removable (adjustable) felt cubes and a cleaning cloth made from the same material as the interior of the case. The only flaw in the case is on the exterior where a felt marker was used to write ""Seth"" on it. You could write over it or try to remove if you wish. The Brass tumbler combination locks work perfectly. The Leather is like brand new. I put the three pictures that represent the case the best as I could in the listing. I have more pictures if you want to see more. I am asking $155 for this case. It was about $300 new.
