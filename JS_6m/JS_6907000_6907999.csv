Recently had it cleaned ultrasonically by a licensed gunsmith. He was very impressed with this firearm. It saw a lot of action horseback within the confinements of a rather stiff saddle scabbard and a bit of the bluing has been rubbed off. Gunsmith told me to not re-blu as it devalued it. If picture comes out OK the rub can be seen. Also, the front sight hood is missing. Sight mount is grooved for the application but my guess the hood was knocked off over the years in that hard leather scabbard.Will not ship rifle.

The result is a pistol that delivers superior performance in durability and reliability, ergonomics, trigger, and modularity. Utilizing a removable, serialized chassis frame, the APX can be easily modified with replaceable grip frame housings and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Each APX comes with 3 interchangeable back straps so users can best fit their hands and preferences. The APX’s aggressive full length slide serrations make slide manipulations easy under any conditions . To accommodate right or left-handed use, the APX’s magazine release button can be easily reversed, and the slide stop is ambidextrous. The APX’s trigger breaks at 6lbs and has a clear tactile and audible very short reset. The APX truly is the ultimate striker fired pistol from Beretta.

Basically giving it all away at $210.00. That is obviously my bottom dollar.  I'm cleaning house and selling most of my firearms. I've moved a lot of them already.So here is the story: you gotta know something about the SKS or don't buy this. It is not ready to shoot. The one complete rifle I assembled months ago and took it out shooting and it worked and then the last round I shot through it, it tore the rim off the 7.62 round and threw hot powder in my face. I thanked Jesus for letting me keep my retinas, as I had my eyewear on. I then retired the rifle and did some research. Some websites said that incorrect headspace (distance between the bolt face when closed and the rear of the 7.62 round) can cause this to happen. Other websites said oversized headspace just reduces accuracy and cannot hurt anything nor cause the failure at the range that I had. Anyway, I checked the headspace with a way suggested on the web (stacking 3 pieces of tape on the back of a loaded 7.62 round, and the bolt shouldn't go all the way forward to the point of locking) but mine did, indicating too many thousandths of an inch between the closed bolt and the back of the chambered round. Anyway, other sites said a dirty chamber will snag the brass and let the bolt pull the rim off of the round when fired...and that the problem indeed is no't headspace. I don't know if headspace causes this or not, but I know this rifle failed the tape test from the internet, and that a rim was pulled off one time when I fired it....that was enough for me to put it down. I've.never adjusted headspace on a rifle.The stock is beautiful and there are a lot of parts here, including the complete rifle; it's a steal if you want to fool with it. I'm selling about every gun I own, so I don't want to fool with it. I'm taking about 150 dollar loss on this, but so be it. I won't travel to give my guns away of course, you have to come to me in Graham, or in Burlington or Elon during the workday Monday thru Friday, for this price.I will answer emails in the order that they come. I don't expect to have this package for long at $210.00"

That is why Wilson Combat® hammers are manufactured from the best quality steel to keep that clean crisp trigger pull shot after shot. Considerable attention has been paid to the geometry of our hammers, particularly to the location of the strut pin hole which has been re-located to aid in obtaining a light trigger pull. Experience has shown that our advanced hammer design enhances reliability and the ability to consistently produce a crisp, yet safe trigger pull. All Wilson hammers have been narrowed to provide adequate slide/hammer clearance and some are skeletonized to improve lock time. It is worth noting that skeletonizing a hammer improves the speed that it travels, which in turn reduces lock time. It does not effect the trigger pull. When you build as many custom pistols as we do, you learn the value of a quality hammer. You can count on Wilson Combat® hammers. Our Value Line Speed Hammer offers you a reliable performance at a very affordable price. With cosmetics basically identical to our deluxe fully machined #337B Ultralight hammer, it has a real custom look too. They're manufactured using the MIM (metal injection molding) process which produces a quality product at a much lower price than possible with conventional manufacturing methods. Note: For best results, we recommend using this Hammer in conjunction with #314C Value Line Sear."" - wilsoncombat.com"

I am thinning my collection and have several listed so please take a look at my other pistols on armslist. Thank you for your time and have a good day. I do have other hard to find guns that are not listed. For example I have many colt guns such as hard to find EL CEN series 1911 38 super, Detective Specials, Snake guns such as unfired enhanced drilled tapped 4 inch Colt King Cobra , unfired 4 inch drilled tapped Colt Anaconda (extremely rare year of 2000) , stainless 4 inch Python (shot 6 times), 6 and 4 inch nicel Python.Hard to find Smith and Wesson guns such as 625-2 (model of 1988 which is believed to only have had 1500 made, all original), Pre-lock Lady Smith revolver, pre-lock 29-3 combat, chiefs special cs-9 like new, and an engraved unfired Smith model 29-10.Have several 1911 guns in brands such as Rock Island, Ruger, Springfield including Loader Operator MC and TRP Operator, Para Ordinance 14 45 limited stainless double stack with 4 mags, early Kimber combat carry with laser gripsAlso have a Walther PPK (Interarms Richmond VA the rarer one) basically like new and a Walther ppk/s with crimson trace laser and box, (smith and wesson) I may accept trades toward other guns and/ or ammo if at a really good deal. Trades would need to be in my favor or something rare that I am looking for. Multiple gun trades are welcome. I prefer pistols though.If you live out of state, purchase will have to be through squaretrade or venmo to protect us both. If you have to send payment any other way, it has to go through gunbroker. We will have to do the transfer through an ffl and you will be responsible for the transfer. All state laws will be followed."
