You can customize your Desert Eagle Pistol with a variety of impressive finishes to add your own distinctive twist to this timeless firearm. All models feature a full Weaver style accessory rail on the barrel from the end of the chamber to right behind the front sight and standard ambidextrous safeties.Features:- The Desert Eagle Pistol is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol with a rotating three lug bolt for positive lock-up.- The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy.- The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear, is easy to clean and very accurate.- Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The Desert Eagle is designed for two-handed shooting.- The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition.- The Desert Eagle Pistol has an automatic slide lock that holds the slide open after the last round is fired.- The safety is ambidextrous — it can be operated by right-handed and left-handed shooters.- When the safety is on, the firing pin is blocked, disconnecting the trigger bar from the sear at the same time.

While it’s a double stack design, it’s not too thick to carry like so many of our competitors’ models. Measuring just 1.2 inches wide, it is barely wider than single stack pistols with far lower capacity.A pistol with a healthy sight radius is easier to shoot under stress, and that’s why we’ve chosen to fit the Mod.2 Tactical Model with a full five-inch hammer forged carbon steel barrel. It’s treated with Melonite to stand up to moisture, sweat, and other undesirable conditions over the long haul."

This is a fun little plinker I built from a standard Ruger 10/22. As far as .22 repeaters go, the 10/22 has always been a favorite. Magazine is specific to this furniture set, but will still accept the normal 10/22 mags - I just think it looks a little funny. I do have the factory 10rd magazine still as well, but it is difficult to use with this stock.Comes with: - (3) 100rd ammo boxes. - (1) 25rd magazine. This is the mag that came with the stock set. - (1) Single point harness - (1) Locking Plano hardcase with custom foam for this rifle. Foam was covered with fabric (did myself)... its not perfect but looks ok - (1) Ruger 10/22 set in Archangel ""Nomad"" stock - (2) Keys for the case - (1) Extra ""flash hider"" that came with the stock setThis really is a great deal for what you're getting. Unlock the box a start plinking. The stock is well built and feels really solid. The rifle will function in both the deployed and folded configurations. The original bolt lock is was upgraded to function with this stock (Original parts come with) as well as the magazine release. Also makes for a great wall decoration.

This handy rifle features open sights a straight comb walnut stock and weighs less than 6 pounds. The 7.62x39 cartridge is a top pick for younger shooters for its low recoil and effectiveness on medium-sized game such as deer or wild boar out to 200 yards. The 527 features a Turkish walnut carbine-style stock and has a 13.46 LOP. It has fixed sights with an integrated 16mm scope base. Built to CIP specifications CZ 7.62x39 chambers are ideal for shooting steel-cased surplus ammo. The 527 Carbine is economical to shoot given the service rifle heritage and the availability of surplus ammunition.Note: Designed to shoot .311 bullets some American brass ammo may not perform as well as the imported steel-cased variety because of SAAMI brass dimensions and varying bullet diameters.

Has 150rds through it. Works fantastic, but it's just not what I'm looking for.  Retail price was $89 + S&H.  Selling for $75. Can send pics of it on a 19 if requested. Must pick up in person. Willing to meet within 30 min drive. text REDACTED   The TBRC Glock Micro Comp is threaded in the standard 1/2×28 thread pitch. It will work on most 9mm Glock barrels threaded in that pitch, including most 40-9 conversion barrels! The Micro Comp only adds about .45″ to the end of your threaded barrel. Our comp was designed for the Glock 19 and when installed will fit in all Glock 34/35 holsters. Although the comp was designed around the Glock 19, it will work very well with any 9mm Glock and will function with any open ended holsters in the event the gun is longer than the holster. Comp mitigates recoil and keeps your gun flat throughout recoil. Shoot faster and flatter with the TBRC Micro Comp!Also have a lvl 3 retention safari land light bearing holster for Glock 34 (or 19 with the comp).  Thanks!"
