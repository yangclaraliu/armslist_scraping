It is built with a ambidexttrous barrel latch, so its easy to break the barrel down to reload for a lefty or righty shooter. Comes with all original box, storage pouch, owners manual and gunsmiths test fire casing. With a low round count through it, it being a little over a year old, and MSRP at $399, my price of $225 is very firm.

Mechanically its not too bad, it does have 4 positive hammer clicks, but the cylinder is a bit loose, it would lock up tighter with a stiffer mainspring, and could be a shooter with mild loads,  - wish it could talk! its still a decent Colt at a price much much lower than others, a nice entry level Colt for collecting.  * I will only sell if you can legally own a firearm, and require a bill of sale with Ar drivers license, Thanks  More pics available"

IF YOU WANT PICS, EMAIL ME AND I WILL RESPOND TO YOUR EMAIL WITH PICTURES.I have for sale or trade 2 Polish Tantals made my Interarms.  THESE GUNS ARE NOT CENTURY INTERNATIONAL GUNS. I say this because early Century Tantals were made with misbored barrels that caused keyholing.  These Tantals are made with chrome lined 5.45x39 bores and unissued Circle 11 Polish Tantal parts kits. These are unfired.  I am only selling these to fund other purchases and they are PRICED TO SELL.  From what I can tell, Interarms does not make Tantals anymore because all the parts kits are gone and will not be imported in the future. Do some research and you will see that Interarms Tantals are the standared for this rifle. Price for each is $690 eachI also have an early Waffen Werks AK74(when they made quality rifles) built on a new, unissued Bulgarian(Russian) military parts kit and NODAK spud receiver(the best in the business).  This was made before Sandy Hook when Waffen Werks quality was second to none for American AK builders.  You may have read about the later guns that had lots of problems with misaligned Waffen Werks inhouse receivers.   THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE GUNS.   Again, this is a NODAK Spud Receiver and the quality on this rifle is up there with Arsenal but without the Arsenal price.  Check out some of the early reviews of these rifles and again, do not confuse this rifle with the later Waffen Werks rifles that had receiver issues.    Price to sell at $650Pics to be added this evening.

Has a 20' barrel with rifle type sights. Accepts 12 Gauge 2 3/4 inch shells. This shotgun was made before the Freedom Group buyout of Remington, when their quality was known to suffer greatly. This gun is a major step up from the Express line of shotguns found in big box retailers, featuring a blued finish (slightly worn, but still beautiful) with an all steel construction. This is far superior to the current finish used by Remington, known to be prone to rust. The extractor is machined, unlike the cast extractor used on the newer shotguns. The overall fit and finish is much nicer than the current line, and the action is buttery smooth. The gun has been cleaned and lubricated, so it will be range ready once you pick it up. This a great option for hunting and home defense. If youd be so inclined you could also send it to Wilson Combat who will upgrade the entire gun; though it is solid as it is. For another $40 I can include a +3 magazine extension; though please note that it protrudes slightly past the length of the barrel. Buyer must pay DROS and FFL transfer fee."
