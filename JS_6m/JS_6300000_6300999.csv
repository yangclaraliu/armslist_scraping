The blueing is good. The second barrel is 26"" (formerly a fixed modified) that has had a choke system installed. There are 2 improved, 1 modified, and 1 full. No vent rib on the 2nd barrel, just a bead. The blueing is fair with some blemishes on the muzzle end, but the barrel is serviceable. I bought it intending to cut it down, but when it arrived today I just couldn't bring myself to throw away a perfectly good choke system (even if it isn't the prettiest).The addition of the second barrel with chokes has transformed a good field/trap gun into a very good all-around option for birds and all sorts of clays. The wood is good too, however the butt stock has been shaved to fit me with a rubber recoil pad replacing the original hard plastic- LOP is now 13.5"". Thanks for looking."

This is a Nosler Custom Rifle, or ""NCR"" for short. The NCR is built with exacting precision to create a modern hunting rifle that possesses all of the finest features of several proven firearm designs. At the heart of the rifle is the Nosler action, a tremendously strong and mechanically precise platform designed for rugged reliability in the field while providing bench-rest accuracy. It has a sliding 3-position safety, adjustable trigger, and even features a double-square bridge with integrally milled Leupold Quick Release (""QR"") scope bases which in combination with the QR rings, allow the scope to be easily removed for travel or storage. This rifle is chambered for the .280 Ackley Improved which is an exceptionally accurate, flat shooting cartridge. It wears a free-floating 24"" stainless steel match grade barrel and the action is pillar and glass bedded to the stock to help ensure extreme accuracy. The metal is finished in tough & corrosion proof matte black Cerakote. Both the sculpted bolt knob and the hinged magazine floorplate are engraved with the ""NC"" Nosler Custom logo. The stock is fashioned from beautifully figured American black walnut and features flawlessly executed 20-lpi checkering, a shadow-line cheek piece, palm swell, contrasting rosewood forend tip & grip cap, inletted swivel bases, and black ""Decelerator"" pad. It comes from the factory with a custom made Leupold scope that is serial numbered to the rifle! The scope is a matte black VX-III 3.5-10x40 with a custom reticle having hold-over points designed to compensate for bullet drop to 500 yards. The package also includes two boxes (40 rounds total) of custom loaded Nosler ammunition, with boxes serial numbered to this rifle as well! A Nosler marked padded leather sling w/ swivels, Nosler hat, owner's manual, and safety lock are included. The whole package comes in a super heavy duty aluminum Kalispel Case Line ""Original"" rifle case which features heavy gauge (.080"") welded construction and four heavy duty latches that can be simultaneously locked with a single padlock by utilizing the stainless steel locking bar.This handsome rifle is in excellent, unused/unfired condition. It shows no wear aside from a couple of handling marks that are so small they are hardly worthy of any mention. I'd grade this rifle at 99.9%!! Needless to say, the mechanics are in perfect shape as is the bore. The scope is also in perfect shape and comes with the original box, scope cover and instructions. This rifle isn't just pretty, it can shoot too! The factory supplied test target shows a 0.26"" (center-to-center) three shot group! These rifles are guaranteed to shoot sub-1/2"" groups with Nosler ammo! What a rifle!!!"

Email preferred for contact. The Barrett Optical Ranging System (BORS) is an integrated ballistics computer that mounts directly on the riflescope and couples to the elevation knob. BORS instantly takes care of the data work by drawing from several tables and taking into account a number of real-time external factors so you can focus on the task of achieving first round hits. After determining the range to target, simply turn the elevation knob until the BORS screen matches your target's distance. Internal sensors automatically calculate the ballistic solution.

SHOOT AK AMMO THROUGH AN AR!!! RESERVE LOWERED!AR-15, M-4 STYLE HEAVY BARREL CARBINE, 7.62 X 39. LIGHTLY USED BUT LIKE NEW. STANDARD BLACK M-4 FURNITURE. THIS CARBINE has a 16” barrel + flash suppressor; 6-position collapsible buttstock; standard M-4 carbine handguard; standard AR front sight tower; “flat-top” upper receiver with Picatinny rail.FEATURES OF THIS CARBINE: I built this carbine for my own recreational use a few years ago when almost all AR parts were extremely hard to come by. Having a strong itch to build another AR, I ran across some 7.62 x 39 barrels with front sight, and thought “Well, WHY NOT?” Carbine is based on a Palmetto State Armory (PSA) semi-automatic lower receiver forged from 7075-T6 aluminum alloy, with mil-spec hard anodized black finish, and standard semi-auto lower parts kit. Lower is model PA-15 and caliber is marked “MULTI.” Don’t recall origin of upper receiver but it’s probably PSA, has the “keyhole” forge mark seen on a lot of different brand uppers. It does have the M-4 feed ramps. I engraved the ejection port dust cover ""7.62 x 39"" on both inside and outside, as a safety feature--visible with cover either closed or open. Recently I've seen nice factory-marked dust covers, and not too expensive, if my poor lettering doesn't appeal to you. ;-) Barrel is marked only with the caliber and twist info (see pics), front sight base has only the forge markings “B” in a diamond followed by a 2; rather common but not really a clue to barrel maker. NOT an “F” marked sight base but it does match the 7.62 x 39 ballistics very well; standard A2 square-post sight. Barrel is medium-heavy profile, twist is 1:10, length 16” without flash suppressor, is equipped with AAC 3-prong suppressor. Sight tower has bayonet lug. I added a side-swivel adapter to facilitate “patrol carry.” I chose a bolt carrier with a higher mass to slow the cycle time (has increased diameter at rear as it was originally designed for piston driven AR’s, to reduce carrier tilt.) Gas key screws are well staked (see pics). Used a Rubber City Armory (Dayton OH) 7.62 x 39 bolt because it has lifetime warranty and they guarantee it even if used with cheap steel-case ammo!FURNITURE : All black. Standard carbine buttstock (marked Palmetto State Armory) on mil-spec 6-position buffer tube. Standard ""fat"" M-4 carbine handguard, single heat shield. Magpul MOE pistol grip with storage compartment, Manicore Armory enhanced poly trigger guard. NOTE: This Carbine was recently listed with camo furniture, but since bidding did not reach the reserve, I've switched furniture and lowered the reserve.CARBINE IS ALSO EQUIPPED with Magpul BUIS flip-up, dual aperture rear sight and basic black web sling. Included FREE 2 ASC (Ammunition Storage Components) alloy magazines. 7.62 x 39 AR mags were almost unobtanium at the time I finished this carbine. All I could get were made by Ammunition Storage Components (ASC) and they are PITIFUL! To start, I actually distorted the first mag with only 27 or 28 rounds. From about 23 rounds onward, it was very difficult getting more in. Then, feeding was a total jam-up until the mag was back down to about 23-24 rounds, then the last 2 rounds would not feed. It's highly unlikely I will ever buy another ASC product! So I’m not charging for those sorry mags, ‘cause I’m sure you would want me to buy them back! I’ve not got around to buying other mags, but Magpul now makes a 7.62 x 39 30-round AR mag, and I have no doubt they work great.PERFORMANCE: Other than the mag issue (now I just load about 22 rounds) I, and friends, have had a blast firing this carbine, but probably under 250 rounds total. Too many guns, not enough range time!! Condition is like new. Having carried an M-16 many years ago for Uncle Sam, I’ve always been a big fan of all AR variants, and have built many for myself and family members. But since I don’t have unlimited finances, I must now sell some of my toys to pay for new builds and acquisitions. I accept Western Union and Money Gram"

This created a great demand for drill rifles suitable for young cadets. At least twelve companies bought surplus military muskets and modified them for use by cadets. This was accomplished by shortening the stock and barrel and thinning the wood making it lighter, shorter, and easier for smaller hands to grasp. Although thousands of muskets were converted, few remain today. This musket started out as a model 1842 Springfield. It has a nice 1852 dated lock. Musket looks better than photo shows. This will be at the Fond du Lac gun show along with my other listings. $1750.00 or best offer. Private viewing can be arranged."

As a former Special Forces soldier who has used most weapons, I can say that this is the ultimate concealed carry pistol--if it can be afforded, this is a professional's #1 choice. Sig makes the highest quality pistols on the market, and many features make it particularly suited for both civilian concealed carry and pros who need to carry their sidearm concealed. For one, the materials and manufacturing are the best--you could drop a Sig off of the Empire State building and it probably wouldn't break. I own 3 and I have only fired this one once--it's like new. It comes with custom grips and the original grips, multiple magazines, original case, original manual, and original gun lock. Specs, features, and product summary are listed below. I've also listed websites at the bottom of the page that have more information and can show that this particular sidearm is priced at rock bottom. FEATURESDehorned, Snag-Free ProfileMelt Treatment on Frame & SlideSRT Trigger SystemSigLite Night SightsErgo Polymer One-Piece GripPRODUCT SUMMARYThe P229 SAS Gen 2 has gone through a radical dehorning process resulting in an ultra smooth, snag-free profile that's ideal for concealed carry. The Gen 2 features a new slide design, a melt treatment on the frame and slide, the Sig Sauer SRT Trigger System, a short trigger, SigLite night sights, and an ergo polymer one-piece grip.

Soft core allows flexible sword and hard 1095 steel on outer edge for razor sharp edge! This is a much more expensive method called (Kobuse) and is heated, Hammer forged and clay tempered to length.
