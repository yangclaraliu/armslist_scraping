It will come with everything it did new, hard case, manual, mag, etc. I love the rifle but need the money for other things at this time.
The DDM4V1, the original Daniel Defense Rifle, is built with a Cold Hammer Forged 16” M4 Profile barrel with a Carbine gas system.  It comes installed with our proprietary front sight base which is precision CNC machined from a solid billet of 4140 steel.  This FSB features a serrated curved design to minimize glare and is salt bath nitride treated minimizing corrosion and wear.  The DDM4 Rail 12.0™ FSP allows the operator to mount a weapon light or aiming device forward of the front sight for optimal ergonomics and a clear line of sight.  Quick disconnect attachment points are integrated to the front and back on both sides of the rail for fully ambidextrous sling attachment.
These rifles are $1889 new, after NC tax that’s $2021.23. Daniel Defense makes a great product, comes with a lifetime warranty, save yourself some money and pick up this rifle.

Excellent home defense, plinker, or pest rifle.Currently, the rifle is dissassembled (not completely). The body stock it came with got damaged a while back and I had intended to order the upgraded ATI stock for a less intimidating look. Buyer would be purchasig the rifle without the body and would have to purhase their own and ressabmle themselves. Its in about 3 or 4 parts, which put together easily no tools required. If you know about common rifles or Hi Point you will know how simple it is.With the rifle and original box, I am including: One trigger lock, one 10 round magazine, one UTG flip up rear sight, one Tru Glo red dot sight, one Magpul angled foregrip, sling, original iron sights, hex key, as well as a laser bore sight for your own use on the range.All you will need to buy is a new recieving body, the ATI stock would be the upgraded version. I believe they can beordered at more stores but an origibal body would have to be purchased from the manufacturer, probably at a not too expensive price.I ask that the buyer present their valid purchase permit or a valid CCW at the time of sale.Price is negotiable.

This particular rifle features a hammer forged heavy barrel which is chrome lined along with the chamber, gas block, and gas piston. They are built on the same standard as the RPK style machine guns, VEPR is 50% more reinforced than a standard stamped AK rifle. The RPK style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them 4-5 times stronger than the standard AK or RPK barrel. This rifle was produced at the famous MOLOT factory which has been building quality rifles for over 50 years. This is the highest quality rifle you can buy based on the Kalishnikov design. Due to recent bans these riflers are no longer being imported and are only getting harder to find. This rifle has been converted to be 922r compliant and features an ATI adjustable stock, Hogue overmold rubber grib which combined with the oversized trigger guard allows for easy operation with gloved hands, quick release scope mount, Tapco trigger group, SGM tactical foregrip, AK47 style brake, (3) 30rd Tapco poymer magazines with anti-tilt followers, Bipod, and all of the original hardware including:10rd mag, 5 rd mag, stock trigger group, and the original walnut handguard and thumhole stock. The scope pictured is not included.

There are no other flaws, unless you count the amusingly bold loaded chamber indicator. This is the version with a manual safety, magazine disconnect (groan), and previously mentioned attention seeking loaded chamber indicator. If you don't want the 16rd mags, I'll take off $25, because I fully intend to rebuy an SR9c when I'm not broke. If you don't like it, I'll rebuy it from you on Feb 28, assuming that it's still in very similar condition.

If the ad is still up, I still have it so please don't message me with ""Still got it"" or ""Text me"". Please send me a detailed message with your location and trade offer. I'm sorry to sounds kind of rude; I'm really not, it's just that I get SO MANY useless and ridiculous messgages when trading a high-end firearm that I'd rather not get stuck in text message conversations with people trying to convince me that their DPMS AR-15 w NC-Star scope and a Ruger LCP is an equal trade.  Anyway, this rifle started life as a heavey barrel short action .308 Savage 10FP LEO (law enforcement model) and then a free-float Choate tactical sniper stock was added and the Accuracy International bottom metal (the thing that allows you to use detachable box mags) was installed. This rifle takes Accuary International .308 mags. Yes, I know they're expensive as hell (about $80 to $100 each) so I'm including 3 of them (two 5rd mags and one 10rd mag and yes they're all marked ""AI""). One of the 5rd mags is painted and the other two are mint.  The paint on the rifle is just Krylon spray paint. The original color of the stock underneath is black and OD green. The scope is a Vortex Viper PST 4-16X50. This scope has tactical turrets and an illuminated reticle. It also is a first focal plane reticle scope so that's super sexy.  The bipod is an authentic Harris 9"" HBLMS bipod and is included.  Again, I'm only looking for trades, not cash.  Keep in mind that the bottom metal and 3 mags are alone worth $550ish so please don't offer me your Glock .40 as a striagt trade. Again, trying not to be a jerk but I get a lot of silly trade offers. Also, the rough value of this package is hard to pin down and I'm certainly not trying to get every penny out of it that I put into it (that'd be silly) but the scope is roughly $700, the bipod about $110, the bottom metal and mags, as I mentioned are about $550, the rifle + tactical stock is about $1,200 so please just keep in mind the rough value when making a trade offer.  Trades can be anything. I'm open to whatever and I enjoy seeing what offers roll in. Please just keep them reasonable and PLEASE include the trade offer in your first message to me. I can follow up from there but I've never seen the point in the people who message me with ""Intersted, message me"". Again, please include where you're located too when you're offering a trade. I'd trade this for one single high end gun or multiple guns. Just let me know what you have, where you're at and roughly when you might be available to meet."

I really only interested in a XDS in 9mm or 40s&w (yes I know 40s&w came out not to long ago) possibly 45acp but Im not thrilled about the five round flush mag. The finish/color combo doesnt really matter to me but I would prefer if its all stock. I know they are in the ""hard to find"" category but would like to try and stay reasonable because Im not sure If I will like it long term. If your interested I do have a SIG P226 DAK 40s&w I would trade for a new XDS in any caliber just ask for more details if your interested. Im in the SE Mass area and would like to stay in that area if possible. Sorry but I wont accept frame transfers, personal EFA10 transfers only. Let me know. Thanks!"
