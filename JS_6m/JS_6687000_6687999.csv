Description of the firearm from Smith and Wesson: 
Smith & Wesson combined a scandium alloy frame with a titanium cylinder to build one of the strongest and lightest revolvers ever made. The Model 360 provides maximum power in a small, lightweight, easy-to-carry package. The frame of the 360 is constructed from a scandium reinforced aluminum alloy. The titanium cylinder weighs just 60% of what a similar stainless steel cylinder weighs and yet is able to withstand the same operating pressures. The 360's barrel is a hybrid construction consisting of a scandium/aluminum alloy shroud keyed into the frame with a metal tab, and a stainless steel barrel tube. An exposed hammer allows for single or double action fire."

If you buy it, I'll throw in a forward grip I bought for it as well as the original stock grip. All in all, you're look at over a $100 discount for a rifle that has never been fired before. I even still have it in the original box. The only reason I'm selling it is because I want to get an AR-10."

It is in great mechanical shape and the stock is actually pretty decent except for two small holes on the right side of the buttstock (maybe someone had some kind of cheek piece on it???). At first I thought the rifle was duracoated or cerakoted but as I looked closer I see some pretty epic runs in the coating and a buddy suggested maybe it is high temp bbq paint. Seems plausible. The rings are quality Leupold rings designed for the ruger integral mounts but they are the ""high"" rings designed for larger objective scopes. The action is solid and the bore looks great. It reminds me of my old Ford pickup. Not much to look at but starts every morning and gets me where I want to go."

Browning focused much of the 725's innovative design on a low profile receiver. Positioning the barrels lower in the receiver changes the relationship of your cheek and eye to the rib, putting face, eyes, and hands closer to the center line of the gun. This ""in-in"" feeling results in a better fit and natural point ability. The 725's low profile receiver also improves recoil control by pushing the gun straight back into the shoulder instead of the muzzle jumping up, which makes getting an aimed, second shot off quicker. The strength of the Citori 725's receiver is not sacrificed by using undersized trunnions and narrow, tapered pins to lock up the receiver as some low profile designs do. The 725 still uses a rugged full-width hinge pin, and the transverse mounted locking bolt design of the original Citori. The Citori 725 features the Fire Lite mechanical trigger design that delivers a light, smooth pull. By not relying on inertia to reset the second hammer, a mechanical trigger ensures you get an immediate second shot, without worrying about your gun unexpectedly doubling. To prevent sporting clay shooters from getting worn down from recoil so they can still be on top of their game at the end of the day, the Citori 725 Sporting uses ported barrels and Browning's Inflex Technology recoil pad.Will ship!"

The action is a pleasing grey finish with a Edelweiss motif on the front and back receiver bridges as well as the highly ornate floor plate. This rifle was obviously built for mountain hunting so the decorative styling matches. The barrel is a full tapered octagon with a matte rib and iron. sights. The blue is perfect from end to end and the bore is bright and shiny. The rifle was built with claw mounts and a factory fitted high quality Swarovski 6X scope with 42MM objective.
