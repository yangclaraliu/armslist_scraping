Since purchase I have put around 250 rounds down the barrel with no issues - I have other LWRCs and am simply looking at expanding my collection in other directions as listed below.   No scratches, but rifle has rubbed against other weapons in the safe.  I am willing to travel up to 1 hour from Birmingham.  I will only perform transaction face to face and within the state.From LWRC Website:
Our SPR uses LWRCI™ manufactured- NiCorr treated cold Hammer Forged spiral fluted barrel that is 20% lighter than unfluted barrels of the same diameter.  The increased surface area reduces heat – speeds up cooling. Nickel-boron coated bolt carrier dellivers unparalleled wear resistance, corrosion resistance and permanent lubricity.

The size shape and design is similar to the Kel-Tec RFB rifle but the KSG ejects downward instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1 OAL and an 18.5 cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3 rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1.75 up to the 3. This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube which is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip a light or a laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail accepts many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.
