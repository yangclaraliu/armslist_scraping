This gun has obviously been fired very little, and has only very minor handling marks. I'm not an official grader of guns, but I would not hesitate to say that the bluing is at least 98%. This is an all-original collectible shooter, equipped with the original 1"" dovetail rings, all ready for your favorite scope. The gun is also equipped with a very nice leather sling.The AI Stamped Sako's were made from 1979-1992, and according to the Sako website, this particular gun is one of the earliest ones made, with a serial number dating it back to the 1979-81 range. This is before ANY changes were made from the original design of this model rifle. Later on they made a few changes, but this one is the old style that isn't too easy to find anymore.Like I said, everything about this gun is simply fantastic. The only handling marks I've noticed are a few small, very light scratches in the high-gloss finish, and the tiniest bit of bluing wear on the bolt handle. I did my best to sow the gun very well in my pictures. If you have any questions or requests for more pictures, just ask, and I will respond to you asap. These guns, which you already know if you know Sako's at all, are absolutely incredible shooters, and if you want to use it for more than just paper targets, it's lightweight-but-strong build, amazingly smooth action and pinpoint accuracy make it one of the finest long-range hunting guns out there!Local face-to-face transactions are always enjoyable, but if you live a distance away and it needs to be shipped, I'm ok with that, too.  Shipping is $35 to the Continental US, or $60 to Hawaii or Alaska. Insurance is optional for the buyer, and will cost an additional $20 upon buyer's request. I accept USPS money orders only for payment.My return policy for shipped guns is this: If the buyer finds that the gun has been falsely advertised, then DO NOT complete the FFL transfer. Instead, have your FFL ship it back to my FFL within 3 days of receiving it, and the full payment will be returned to buyer immediately, minus any shipping and FFL fees that have been incurred, given that the gun comes back to me in the same condition that I sent it. There will be no returns allowed if an FFL transfer has been completed, so please inspect your gun thoroughly BEFORE you decide to make the transfer. I sell my guns with great confidence, and therefore I do not expect that the buyer will want to return it, but just in case, I do like to offer my buyers an opportunity to return a purchase based on their assessment of the accuracy of my advertisement. If you want to be more confident in your purchase, you can find this gun for sale under the same title on GB, and I welcome you to read any of my buyer feedbacks, all of which are A+ feedbacks, thankfully.Thanks for checking out this beautiful gun.  If you are interested, I look forward to hearing from you soon.  You can either email me through this sight or text me at REDACTED.  Thanks again.  God bless."

Never fired Comes with 1 thirty round mag and rifle. It's the exact rifle in this link but with a Tennessee arms lower receiver. If you buy it from PSA you would pay $599 plus $25 shipping plus $25 for a ffl transfer fee and $10 for a background check and $12 for the mag. So you would pay $670-$675. I'm open to cash offers or trades. Text me at REDACTEDhttp://palmettostatearmory.com/psa-16-freedom-rifle.html"

I special ordered it last year and it arrived a few weeks ago. I shot just over 200 rds through it since I got it. Only reason for selling is I picked up a STI Marauder while I was waiting for the Costa to come in so I am using the 2011 Marauder for 3-Gun now. Comes with original box, papers, 1-140mm mag and 1-126mm mag. STI updated the recil master with the new race ready recoil master. Its a 10 out of 10 condition. These are going for $3600 on gunbroker. Here is some info from STI Website.STI continues its push for honest, game changing innovation with the introduction of the Costa Carry Comp. Its island comp BBL is machined from a single piece of stainless steel, which eliminates timing issues and the potential to come loose. The front sight is attached to the compensated BBL—making this the first ever barrel with a compensator in front of an island sight. The technology further reduces muzzle jump and enables you to keep eyes on the front sight rather than the blast of the comp. The comp reduces recoil by 63%. The STI RecoilMaster dual spring recoil system further reduces recoil, effectively making this the flattest, smoothest shooting pistol on the market. PERFORMANCE FEATURES The Costa Carry Comp is DLC coated from top to bottom and features our TreeBark Stippled Grip. This model comes with 2 magazines, 126mm and 140mm, ambidextrous safety, full length tactical rail and STI’s lifetime warranty. The BBL is 4.15” and the comp takes the overall length to 5.1, the same length as a standard 1911. Our RecoilMaster dual spring recoil system is added to further reduce recoil. This is the flattest, smoothest shooting pistol on the market.

You are looking at a modified authentic antique 1940s era Graflex 3-cell camera flash unit as was used in A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back and most recently in The Force Awakens. This lightsaber is screen correct to the smallest detail of the Rey/Finn used prop unlike the inaccurate ""Hero Prop"" on display at the Launch Bay at Disney. Includes a Maz Kanata inspired display box and a clear acrylic TFA engraved display stand. This prop was built in such a way as to not permanently alter the original Graflex components and can be returned to being an unaltered vintage flash. I also have a custom built illuminated ""crystal chamber"" insert for the inside of the prop giving it the highest level of fan obessed realism. Contact me me for additional images.Looking to trade it for the right rifle.
