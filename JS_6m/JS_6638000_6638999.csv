In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S 3.3 Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it. The strengths of the XD-S 3.3 Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm) and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics complete with two interchangeable backstraps  allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System, grip safety,loaded chamber indicator,firing pin block,and grip safety that make the entire family of XD pistols safe and easy to use."

The strengths of the XD-S 3.3 Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm) and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics complete with two interchangeable backstraps  allow it to work without punishing your hands.

Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself. With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, a checkered slide release and an ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull-even and smooth. Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare.Model: Solo CarryCaliber: 9MMBarrel Length: 2.7""Weight:17ozsSights: 3 DotFinish: Duo ToneGrips: SynthetricCapacity 6 +1MSRP: $924"

Sorry for the confusion, this is a 10mm.I have a Gen II Kriss Vector CRB in 10mm that I got from Family Firearms that I'm looking to sell. It will come with three 15 round Glock mags, original case and accessories, and I can sell the Eotech 512 with it as well. I have serval boxes of ammo as well that'll be included. For everything without the Eotech, I'd take $1250 (Brand new they're $1660 with 8.3% tax for referance). For everythign WITH the Eotch, I'll sell for $1550. I took it to the range twice and never had a single issue. It is the rifle configuration so you can have a stock one it (which is easy to change out). I am wanting to build an AR pistol. If you would like to trade, I'm would take an AR plus cash so I could build to what I'd like. If you have a really nice AR I probably won't want to trade due to it being worth more and it probably would be fair to ask for cash on top."
