Hey folks posting my zoraki 925 blank gun up for sell. Blank guns shoot only blank ammunition but have the same exact sound/ effect of a real firearm. Only difference is there isn't a projectile (bullet) exiting the barrel. Blank guns are primarily used for theatre/movie productions to give a more realistic experience but I have seen blanks guns used in other functions such as a non-lethal alternative to home protection. Once again, these blanks are as loud."

One of the nicest features of the firearm is the newly-designed forend, covered in M-LOK attachment points to keep the profile slim while still being big enough to swallow most pistol-caliber suppressors should the owner decide down the road to convert it into an SBR for use with a suppressor.Low-profile aluminum adjustable sights round out the platform, and a top Picatinny rail allows the mounting of a wide number of optics. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.Specifications:- Purpose: Home Defense - Caliber: 9mm Luger - Barrel Length: 16.20"" (Muzzle Brake)- Capacity: 20+1 Rounds- Magazine Type: Double Stack Polymer - Frame Fiber-reinforced Polymer - Safety: Ambidextrous Thumb Safety- Grips: Polymer, Adjustable for Reach to Trigger - Trigger Mechanism: SA - Sights: Low Profile Fully Adjustable Aperture and Post, 4 Rear Aperture Sizes - Barrel: Cold Hammer Forged, Muzzle Threaded 1/2x28- Length: 34 3/4""- Weight: 6.10 lbs CASH PRCE LISTED.

Its stunning, the wood appears as if it was dipped in the finish. It has been fired a total of 10 times, 8 times by the original owner and all of 2 times by me (I forgot the shells the one day I went out - fml). The gas system is supposedly the epoch of design, considered almost flawless and most prefer it to the later iterations although it has a few more parts - I cannot say either way other than it fed those two shots like a mf'er and the previous owner didnt recall any ftf in the whole 8 shots he put downrange. I am looking for a carry pistol, caliber not very impoprtant other than .380 and greater. I also love, L-O-V-E. me a 1911. Cash value is around $800, trades a bit higher and cash can be added either direction. Get rid of that ugly 1911 or carry gun and get the gun that makes your underwear a little tighter if you know what i mean (photos nowhere near do this justice). Thanks, jr"

The new design has additional metal reinforcement in the high pressure sections to surpass military pressure and weight bearing tests. The Omni Hybrid lower features a patented hammer and trigger pin retainment system which increases stability and accuracy by preventing movement from the hammer and trigger pin during firing. This AR-15 lower receiver also features a patented over-molded metal insert, which reinforces the buffer tube housing and rear takedown pin, allowing for metal-on-metal contact with both the buffer tube as well as the rear takedown pin. This decreases the impact from recoil for more consistent firing. The ATI lower receiver combines strength and durability and is a fantastic choice to build your next 5.56mm NATO, 7.62x39mm, .300 AAC Blackout or other popular AR-15 caliber conversions.
