This is the more desirable heel stamped model (like an M1 Garand). It is in a synthetic stock but comes with an extra wood (walnut?) stock. It comes with 8 20 round magazines: 4 USGI marked BRW S-I (correct weld spots and latch plate holes as far as I can tell) and 4 unknown manufacturer (I looked these up and they look like Norinco mags but IDK for sure). Also included is a 1st gen Springfield Armory scope mount. The internals are in excellent shape and the chrome-lined barrel is shiny as it should be. It is a great shooter as it sits or it would make an excellent base for a clone build or match rifle given the correct forged receiver. I have put less than 100 rounds through it but I am not the original owner so I don't know the actual round count. It functioned as it should through the few rounds I've put through it. It doesn't have any USGI parts other than the stock as far as I can tell. The M14 itself is valued at $1000 given that it is the more desirable heel stamped model, not side stamped. The mags are $35 each for the USGI (4x35=$140) and $20 each for the Norinco (4x20=$80). The Springfield Armory scope mount is valued at $60. The extra wood (walnut?) stock is around $40. Total trade value is $1320. I will not separate this package.  Communication through Email is preferred. I can text if necessary. Absolutely no calls.

Comes with all that was included from the factory such as the Vortex window decal, the sunshade (still in the paper wrapping), the manuals, the allen wrench, the shims and the Vortex lapel pin not to mention the black Vortex cleaning cloth (still in the plastic).The scope also has a lighted reticle with 10 different brightness settings.
This is one fantastic scope backed by a no questions asked lifetime warranty.

I paid $750 for this scope and after tax I have $815 invested. Looking for reasonable cash offers.
Would also consider trading for a high-end variable power Leupold in the 6.5-20 power range without the target turrets.

They chamber the power of the .45 ACP and are fitted with custom features that make them an exceptional value.CDPs are some of the most successful pistols Kimber has ever produced, and certainly the most copied. Others have dressed up a basic 1911 to look like a CDP, suggesting it is as good as a Kimber and selling it for a lower price. They may be able to copy the look but no company can match Kimber quality and performance. There is also a certain irony in the suggestion that you should trust your life to the low bidder.Each CDP has 30 lines-per-inch checkering on the front strap as well as under the trigger guard for a positive grip. A match grade Premium Aluminum Trigger is consistent from shot to shot. Stainless steel small parts like the slide release, magazine release and beavertail grip safety, plus hand-checkered double diamond rosewood grips compliment the two-tone matte finish.The 1911 is proven to be the most dependable semi-automatic platform for a carry pistol, and Kimber makes the best 1911. Don’t trust your life to anything less than the best. Meprolight Tritium three dot night sights and an ambidextrous stainless steel thumb safety are standard CDP features.Includes 1 spare magazine"

The new Gen II billet lower receiver is based off of our original Biohazard billet lower receiver but with many added features, reduced weight, and enhanced styling. If you want the absolute best AR15 lower receiver on the market then this is for you!   Gen II billet lower receiver specifications and features:   - All edges and surfaces have been 3D chamfered to reduce snagging while still maintaining the blocky billet look    - Type III hardcoat anodized finish     - Integrated winter style trigger guard    - Integrated ambi bolt release paddle. The paddle is machined from 4140 Chromoly bar stock and features a durable black Nitride finish     - Integrated ambi magazine release paddle. The paddle is machined from 4140 Chromoly bar stock and features a durable black Nitride finish   - Oversized enhanced bolt catch. The bolt catch is machined from 4140 Chromoly bar stock and features a durable black Nitride finish   - Enhanced 6061-T6 billet magazine catch button which features a hard anodized finish   - All paddles are ergonomically positioned and optimized for both left hand and right hand shooters. The paddle surfaces and mag catch button also feature an aggressive textured finish for positive engagement   - Enhanced pivot and take down pins which were designed around the lower receiver for a unique integrated look The pivot and take down pins are machined from 6AL4V Titanium and feature a grey hard anodized finish infused with Teflon for ultra-smooth function   - The pivot and take down pins have slightly larger heads and dimples in the end which allow you to break the rifle down much quicker and easier   - Lower receiver design integrates KNS Gen 2 Mod ST anti-rotation pins. Very low profile and very clean appearance   - Large flared magwell   - Magwell is compatible with all AR15/M16 magazines including the M3 Pmag, Beta C mag, and Surefire high capacity magazines   - Magwell will drop free of ALL in-spec magazines   - The front of the magwell is textured for an aggressive appearance   - Low shelf for RDIAS use   - Set screw for adjustable trigger reset   - Set screw for upper to lower tension   - Bolt catch and bolt release paddle are retained with a threaded stainless steel pin rather than a roll pin   - Lower receiver can be assembled without a hammer and punch   - 3D machined Spider logo   - 3D machined bullet pictogram safety selector markings on both sides of the receiver   - Clean milled engraving for all text and information   - Caliber is marked Multi for use with any cartridge that will fit in an AR15 magwell   - Compatible with 45* BAD ASS, 57* V7, 60* Noveske, and all 90* safety selectors   - Pockets machined in many areas to reduce weight. The lower receiver design was engineered to put the weight and strength exactly where we wanted it. The end result is a cutting edge billet lower receiver that weighs only 248.9 grams stripped! Now you can have a billet lower receiver with full ambi controls at the weight of a standard forged receiver without sacrificing any strength.  Technical specifications:   The Gen II billet lower receiver comes with the following components already installed to make your life easier:     Titanium pivot pin, detent, and spring     Titanium take down pin, detent, spring, and 4-40 set screw     KNS Gen 2 Mod ST anti-rotation trigger and hammer pins     Spike's Tactical 90* ambi safety selector     Enhanced bolt catch     Ambi bolt release paddle     Bolt catch spring     Bolt catch plunger     Ambi bolt release cross pin     Threaded stainless steel pin for bolt catch     Threaded stainless steel pin for ambi bolt release paddle     Ambi magazine release paddle     Magazine catch     Magazine catch spring     Billet magazine catch button     Set screw for adjustable trigger reset     Nylon tip set screw for upper to lower tension     These are the parts required to complete the Gen II billet lower receiver.

Upper Receiver Billet Upper- Gen II (Mil Spec Barrel Nut) IntroductionThe Spike’s Tactical billet upper-Gen II receiver is not just another different cosmetic alternative to forged upper receivers but it’s actually designed with functional upgrades that aren’t available on other billet upper receivers! We machine this bad boy out of 7075 billet Aluminum and finish it in a durable Type III Hardcoat Anodized finish. Of course, we cut the M4 feed ramps before the Anodizing process to avoid reliability issues down the road. We also flared the side walls of the receiver to eliminate accidental bolt release problems and we also machined the upper receiver in a way that lets you use the popular Magpul BAD lever or other aftermarket bolt catch levers which most other billet upper receivers don’t let you do. Because of our beefier design, it allows for less flex than forged upper receivers. We also play nice here at Spike’s Tactical and because of that, we machined our billet upper receiver to accept most aftermarket rail systems as well as pre-install the forward assist and the ejection port door. Just like how our billet lower receiver utilizes set screws to retain everything in place, the forward assist is held in place with a set screw for easy disassembly if you ever need to in the life of this upper receiver. Our billet upper receiver matches our billet lower perfectly, but it also works great with standard forged lowers so it’s fully up to you on which receiver you want to use. Get one today and make your next build the envy of everyone at the range! Features  Machined from billet 7075 Aluminum with a Type III Hardcoat Anodized finish M4 feed ramps machined before the Anodizing process Flared side walls to eliminate accidental bolt release Pre-installed forward assist and ejection port door Works with the Magpul BAD lever and other aftermarket bolt release levers Spikes Tactical engraving Works with most other aftermarket rail systems    Included  Spike’s Tactical billet upper Gen II receiver (stripped) Forward assist and ejection port door cover come pre-installed    The billet upper and lower receivers also maintain compatibility with most Mil-Spec components. So in the event you break or loose a component in the field you don't have to worry about finding any proprietary parts to get it back up and running again. Yes we did think of everything."

 From my personal collection a fantastic premium pocket pistol in excellent condition perfect for concealed carry.  This is a 380 ACP that you can carry with confidence and conceal with little effort.  It is perfect for pocket carry, ankle carry, or even wallet holster carry with no imprinting for anyone to see.
 The KAHR P380 is one of the finest pocket 380 ACP pistols you can find.  The ""P"" denotes KAHR's Premium Series line in part due to the Premium Lothar Walther Match Grade polygonal Barrel.  Don't confuse this with their ""C"" Value Series line. 
 Everything is as it came new in the box.  Comes with two magazines.  This is definitely one of my favorite pocket pistols but I have my eye on something else so someone else has the opportunity to own this quality pistol.
Must meet all legal requirements, be over 21 and an Ohio resident for Ohio Private Sale.  I keep records of all my firearm transactions so be prepared to provide a copy of your driver's license or CCW.

Featuring the GripZone®, the XD® Mod.2™ Service Model is ready for duty, a day at the range and even concealed carry.  With high visibility low-profile sights and a slim-contour frame, the XD® Mod.2™ Service Model is a feature packed full sized double-stack pistol. At just two tenths of an inch wider than the industry’s slimmest single stack polymer frame pistols, the Mod.2™ offers 12+1 rounds of .40SW. The noticeably slim profile and other features combine to make the Mod.2™ Service Model a pistol that offers excellent ergonomics and serious firepower in a surprisingly concealable full sized handgun. Plus, you can choose between two attractive finishes – all black, or bi-tone.  Like all XD®s, the Mod.2™ Service Model is loaded with safety features. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip-safety, internal firing pin block, and the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ all work to make the XD® Mod. 2™ Service Model a safe and easy to use pistol.  And of course, GripZone® ergonomics set the XD® Mod.2™ apart from all others. Optimized contact between the human hand and the frame of the pistol keep the Mod.2™ Service Model on target for round after round. When you pick up the XD® Mod.2™ 4” Service Model, you might find that a trip to the range is in your immediate future. After that, you’ll probably find that you’ve got a new favorite pistol."
