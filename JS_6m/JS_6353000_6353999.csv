The M6A2 rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI carbine systems feature their short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. M6A2 rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of LWRCI's rifles, the bolt carrier group of the M6A2 rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts. The 16"" barrel is Cold Hammer Forged and NiCorr treated with a 1:7"" twist rate. The barrel is also spiral fluted to reduce weight by 20% and is treated with a NiCorr surface conversion process. This rifle has a 12"" lightweight scupted quad rail handguard derived from LWRC's REPR platform. This rifle features LWRC's enhanced fire control group and both it and the bolt carrier group are coated with a proprietary nickel coating for permanent lubricity. The butt stock is a B5 SOPMOD and the pistol grip is a MagPul MOE+. The sights are LWRC folding BUIS.Caliber: 5.56x45MM NATOCapacity: 30RD PMAG includedBarrel: 16"" barrel, 1:7"" RH Twist, Spiral FlutedOverall Length: 33.5"" - 36.8""Weight(unloaded): 7.2 pounds"

The rifle has around 200 rounds throught it, its been a bit of a safe queen. The rifle comes with seven 20 round magazines. Always well maintained by a Marine. This thing is around the same weight as an AR15, but with a whole lot more power. The sale will be done through an FFL, with any fees paid by the buyer.

As new in every way.  The new bi-directional, X-Tac frontstrap and slide treatment offer enhanced grip and improved durability over traditional checkering in severe and hard-use environments. X-Tac pattern redefines secure shooting comfort and gunhandling without the coarse, often painful nature of other grip treatments. In tandem with our G-10 Starburst grips, the X-Tac tread pattern locks securely into the firing hand and will reduce muzzle flip without snagging on clothes or cover garments.

This high profile rear sight has a .145” wide U-Notch for optimum sighting in low-light, dynamic range conditions. The rear blade of the sight is serrated, while the notch area is recessed into a semi-circular pocket for a crisp, protected sight picture.Accuracy Guarantee: 1″ at 25 ydsCan pick up at my office in New Albany 9-5 weekdays by appointment, with Ohio DL/CCW license, or can ship to your FFL for actual insured cost, $50-$75 is a guess, if your FFL takes shipments from individuals and its lawful in your state for me to do so.

You can do a Google search if you want to know more about it. The pistol is a great design though. Fully ambidextrous with no modifications--safety, slide catch, and magazine release. It's single or double action. You can leave one in the pipe with the hammer back and safety on, or use the decocker to safely move the hammer forward before res-afing. Either way it will fire once the safety is disengaged. Color is flat dark earth for the frame and flat gray/black for the slide. Backstrap is also able to be changed out to fit your hand better. I have the curved one on currently, but there's also a flat backstrap included.Willing to ship through authorized FFL. Buyer pays shipping."
