This shotgun features a 25"" long vented and ribbed barrel, topped with a bead sight at the end. The receiver is beautifully engraved on both sides, and lacks any rusting, staining, discoloration, scratches, or scrapes.

The M7A1 was the training practice round for the M1, M1A1, and the M9 rocket launcher. This round has a stamp date of 10/43. These rounds never had a warhead on them, they are inert and were just used for test firing. This one looks like it has been fired, the fine are a little bent and the wire fuse connected to a solder on the fin is disconnected. From what I've read, this is an indication of it being fired. These are becoming very hard to find, and this would make a great addition to a Militaria collection. I've seen these sell anywhere from $100-$300 a piece. The condition of this one, I'd say it would be in the $150 range. I'm open to cash offers, but would trade for the right thing.

Large capacity for cleaning barreled actions up to 34"" inside and out!
Looking for firearms, optics in trade.

Lyman has introduced the market's largest and most powerful ultrasonic cleaning system: The Turbo Sonic Power Pro. This system's extra long, heated tank and ten powerful industrial transducers allow gunsmiths, armorers or any shooter to quickly and easily clean, lubricate and protect the widest range of metal items.

Designed for high volume cleaning or for larger than normal items, the new Turbo Sonic Power Pro's 34-3/4"" heated stainless steel tank can easily handle most barreled actions, upper receivers, as well as quantities of handguns. The powerful industrial transducers aggressively deep clean and degrease items, both inside and out. In fact, the Power Pro is such an effective cleaner that Lyman recommends that cleaned parts immediately be ultrasonically treated with Lyman's Turbo Sonic Gun Lube. Changing from cleaning to lubrication is easy with the built in drain system.

Designed for volume professional usage, the Power Pro features an all stainless design and professional controls. For complete control of the process, the Power Pro has both a timer and an adjustable heat control. Temperatures up to 175 degrees can be selected."

The MK1 series, developed by Primary Weapons Systems, is a significant product improvement for the M4/M16-type carbines and rifles. Utilizing our proven long stroke piston system, the MK1 series greatly reduces fouling in the action of the weapon making it as reliable as the AK47 that it was designed after.   The MK1 series has been used in Iraq and Afghanistan, and has gained wide popularity with security personnel, law enforcement and civilians alike.   The origins of the MK1 series began with the fascination in the simplicity and reliability of the AK47 combined with a deep-rooted appreciation for the ergonomics of the M4/M16 platform. Having a significant understanding of the deficiencies in the direct gas impingement operating system found on conventional M4/M16-style weapons, PWS developed the MK1 series with the professional in mind.   Significant improvements have been made over both the direct gas impingement operating system and previous offerings of piston-driven operating systems. The product improvements made by PWS have addressed reliability and performance issues as well as reduced carrier tilt, cam pin wear and carrier bounce. In addition, we have one of the lightest systems on the market today!   An innovative hand guard system utilizes a proprietary non-free float system that allows the end user or unit armorer to replace individual rails as needed without removing the barrel, barrel nut or even other rails. This system allows the user to attach numerous Picatinny rail-mounted devices such as sights, lights, and laser aiming devices.   The PWS proprietary operating system utilizes an operating rod that is attached to the carrier and a floating head piston that is attached to the operating rod. The MK1 series is built to be a true combat carbine. With no unnecessary gas adjustments and only one moving assembly, this is the most rugged, simple and versatile piston operating system available.   The MK1 series is available as a complete rifle or as a complete upper receiver for use on existing M4/M16 style lower receivers."

If anyone else has dealt with him and has his phone number that would be greatly appreciated. He will not respond to my emails asking for an explanation. Im posting a pic of his current listings. I'm not one to slander somebody but this was blatantly a scam and a deceitful deal. This guy should have his ass kicked by a real Marine.

From their site:
The ELCAN SpecterDR 1.5x/6x is the second evolution in the family of Dual Role Optical Sights. Based upon the battle-proven SpecterDR design, the SpecterDR 1.5x/6x provides higher magnification to enable greater precision and longer engagement ranges, while at the same time providing exceptional field of view in CQB mode.
The SpecterDR 1.5x/6x enjoys ELCAN’s famous crystal-clear optics as well as a generous eye relief, making it the ideal instrument for designated marksman rifles and other long range applications. As with all SpecterDR sights, the magnification and field of view can be changed instantly with the throw of a lever. Depending upon the situation, the user may adjust the sight to illuminate the crosshair or just a brilliant red dot in the center. Because the reticles are etched in glass, they are plainly visible even in the case of loss of electrical power due to battery failure or EMP.
The SpecterDR family offers the best single solution for Long Range and CQB engagements and is designed to withstand the rigors of modern professional use."

The XD-S® Single Stack  from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.

The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.

The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use"
