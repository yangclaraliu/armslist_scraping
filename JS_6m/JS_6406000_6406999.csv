No scammers. I am savvy to all of the scammer tricks, so don't waste your time. This is a serious gun, owned by a serious gun lover. I am selling this gun as I am moving up into the Wilson Combat league. Gun is in PERFECT condition and I purposely bought the Gen 3 vs the Gen 4. If you put them both in your hand and fire them, I found that the Gen 3 felt better and I was able to shoot it more accurately than the Gen 4, so I bought the Gen 3 (not giving you a sales pitch… rather, sharing information)."
