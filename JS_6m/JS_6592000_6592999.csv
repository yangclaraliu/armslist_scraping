Has the trapezoid (triangular) front and rear sights, which you’ll love. Only selling because it has the same grip angle as the Glock, which is different from every other pistol I own, and just not willing to change the way I draw and aim for just one gun.
Trap sights draw your eye and are very quick to pick up; extremely accurate and that grip angle makes for softer recoil than most 9mm pistols. (Yes, I really like this gun, except for the grip angle!)
No shipping, no trades; will meet in/near Chattanooga."

The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots with a caliber this powerful have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the M1A™ SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armory’s® forward scout-style Picatinny mount. Of course, the M1A™ SOCOM 16 also has the legendary performance and reliability that M1A™ shooters have come to love and expect."

Has less than 100 rounds through it and is in perfect condition. Comes with the waterproof, airtight cylinder. Since it is a Mossberg 500, any compatible accessories can be installed, including a stock if you want. Certainly one of the most unusual-looking guns to come out is the Mossberg 500 Chainsaw. Built in the iconic Mossberg 500 action, the Chainsaw is a pistol-grip pump-action shotgun with no stock. While guns like this are desirable for home defense, they're notoriously hard to control while firing, a problem that Mossberg has solved by attaching a wrap-around chainsaw-style hand grip to the pump. Intended to be fired from the hip, this top handle allows the user to cycle the action while simultaneously maintaining leverage above the gun to help tame muzzle flip. In addition to the chainsaw-style grip, the 500 Chainsaw has a stand-off barrel that can be used to breech doors and three rails that can mount accessories."

It is recoil operated much like the venerable Browning A-5. The production years for this model were 1968-1973. The gun looks good and is in nice condition for it's age. The internals are in great shape and honestly don't appear to show much use, and have been freshly cleaned and lubricated. This model uses a friction ring under the forearm to retard the speed of the action. For light loads, the friction cone can be turned flat side to the friction ring. For heavy loads, the friction cone can be flipped to further compress the friction ring during cycling. It is a simple yet brilliant design (Thanks John Browning!!!).   The chamber is 2-3/4"". The barrel length is 26"" with a fixed Improved Cylinder choke. This would be a great bird gun and would be equally at home shooting trap or skeet. FFL transfer required to buy this shotgun, buyer to pay fee. LOCAL FTF SALE ONLY$400 is as low as I can go"

The design of the TAP Barrier round allows the projectile to maintain its structural integrity while punching through barriers, yet still initiate expansion in soft tissue.

The Tanto Blade can be quickly deployed with the ambidextrous sliding button. Pushing forward on the button deploys the blade out the front of the handle and pressing backwards on the button retracts the blade back into the handle where it is ready again to be deployed at a moments notice. The 3.9″ Tanto blade comes with an aggressive partially serrated edge giving you tearing and cutting power making it a great all purpose blade. The Tanto blade is exceptional at both piercing and slicing due to its angular shape and tapered spine which creates a strong point. The Zinc Alloy is ""Cerakoted"" and patterned for non-slip handling in any environment. The metal pocket clip is reversible and can be carried in the button back or button front positions. When clipped into the pocket it has a nice low profile “ride”. The end of the knife features a glass breaker pommel designed to shatter glass or break anything else you might need to in case of an emergency. All RCT OTF Knives have a safety feature that will not allow the blade to fully deploy if anything is obstructing it’s path. The blade will then need to be reset by pulling the blade all the way into its locking position making it again fully functional.Total Length : 24cm / 9.4inBlade Length : 10cm / 3.9inBlade Thickness : 0.3cm / .11inBlade Width: 2.8cm / .11inBlade Material: 440C Sta"

This is a great pistol with many of the features of the Government Model 1911A1 except that it has adjustable target sights and a slightly shorter barrel. It was designed so that you could target practice with nearly the same sized frame as that used by your .45 ACP 1911. With the cost of ammunition today, this makes even more sense than it did way back in 1937 when this Ace was produced. This pistol has been scroll engraved and refinished in nickel, with several custom D.W. King Gun Sight Co. additions: as a minimum, the barrel bushing, front sight and trigger shoe. It has about 95% of its nickel finish remaining. It has a spots of erosion on the right front of the slide and the bottom of the front strap. There is also a compression mark with surface loss on the slide next to the ejection port, along with minor handling marks in both the slide and frame. The grips are bone. They show some yellowing and minor surface cracks from age, as well as three cracks in the right grip that extend to the inside surface. The bore is bright with sharp rifling but shows a tool mark near the muzzle. The pistol comes with a brown hardwood case. This is a very nice looking pistol that got some oohs and aahs when it was first brought out of the case. The collectors should have interest in this pistol, as there were only about 11,000 made, and there sure won’t be any more of them. If the collectors don’t give this the notice its due, some lucky shooter will get a chance at a great looking target pistol with a nice bore, complete with a handsome wooden case. Using this pistol to target practice with and hone your sight picture and trigger control skills will certainly be a lot less expensive, and probably more fun than practicing with .45 ACP ammo."
