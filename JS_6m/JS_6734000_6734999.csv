Both companies are based in the state of Montana, and both have an excellent reputation of quality and precision. This rifle is chambered in what many would call the best of precision long range cartridges for BPCR shooting. The Venerable 45-110. I will be including 80 pieces of brass as well as the mould for the highest ranked Paper Patched bullet amongst competitive BPCR shooters. The ""Money Bullet"". The mould was built under the brand name of Buffalo Arms and sold exclusively through their onlibe store. The mould does not include handles which allows the caster the option to choose what grip will work best for them. There will be a few other supplies going with this, since I will have no need of them. Including though not limited to two jars of 1.5 f black powder.This rifle cost me about $2200, The scope and mounts were over $1000, The various pieces I will be adding in with it are worth near $500. I have not put a single round through it, and the condition is near perfect.I am selling this machine not entirely voluntary. I feell guilty about having it, now knowing that I will never shoot it. I cannot have a safe queen rifle. But I do not have the kinda of dedication and patience to properly clean and maintain a black powder cartridge rifle. That is part of why I do not have the handles for the mould yet, or any lead to send along with it. I know and accept the possibility that this may end up never fired, but I cannot be directly responsible for that. What the new owner uses the machine for is not my business.This rifle has a lack of aesthetic decoration. Instead you will fibd a heavy 34"" barrel and an upgraded double set trigger. Before all else this rifle was built to shoot, and to win. I am open to partial trades. I am most interested in milsurp weapons in the 30-06 or 7.62 flavor. Though I have a special place for anything begining with a 6.5 or 303. I will always be in the need of more reloading and gunsmithing tools and supplies. With a good enough offer I may consider a full trade.Email me at mekkaviking at gmail dot com for more photos or any questions.I am convincing myself to sell this beautiful machine. I am not likely to shoot it at any point, though it represents a good chunk of my time and money. I drooled over this rifle and scope combination literally for years before fi ally buying one. It took nine months waiting for C Sharps in Big Timber, Montana to complete this machine. Add another three months waiting for the scope and mounts ro be buolt by MVA, also in Montana. Most firearms enthusiasts have a dream rifle or pistol they wish they could have. This was my obsession. I read every piece of literature I could find on this machine, watched every video, spent countless hours emailing and calling experts to get every bit of detail. Please keep this in mind when making an offer."

It also takes glock 19 or 17 mags and here's everything I would include to it...- Magpul Angled Grip- Streamlight TLR-4 Laser Light Combo- One 33 Round Glock Mag- One 15 Round Pmag- Midwest Industries Mount To Fold Gun- Primary Arms Red Dot With 50,000hours Battery Life- Adjustable Buttstock- Threaded BarrelBasically it will come with the original box and I still have the boxes for all the attachments I put on it also. Honestly, it's a very nice firearm that's perfect for a backpack/truck gun that I put together and there's nothing more for me to say. Never had any issues with it what's so ever. Right now I'm just throwing it out there for any trade offers but just an FYI I'm not in a rush to get rid of it because I do really like the gun. Just seeing if there's something new I can have in my collection. I feel like I'm forgetting something but I put mostly everything about it in the discription. I also have other guns that I can put into the trade too. Thanks for looking!"

Tracer ammo is a great training tool for shooting in low light situations. Many serious shooters find that shooting with tracer ammo is a fun experience and a great training tool. You can actually watch the bullet's flight path through the air with your naked eye! M196 55 gr tracer ammo is actually preferred by many civilian shooters over the more commonly found M856 64 gr tracer load. The reason for this preference is that this projectile will stabilize in a broader range of barrels from 1:9 to 1:12 while the M856 projectile is properly stabilized with only a quick twisting 1:7 twist rate which is less common. If you're unsure, just check your AR-15's barrel and the twist rate will be displayed. If you see a 1:9 or 1:12, then you're good to go!  This ammo comes pre-loaded on 10 round stripper clips which make it super quick to load magazines with. Additionally, the stripper clips loaded in sleeves come in more portable bandoleers for easy toting back and forth to the range. Whether you're looking to do some serious low light training or target practice, Lake City's M196 5.56x45mm ammo is a great option!  Each round is brass-cased, boxer-primed, non-corrosive, and reloadable. It is both economical and precision manufactured in the United States by an established U.S. cartridge producer.EMAIL ME OR TEXT REDACTED"

It is a model 649, which is a stainless steel j-frame in .357 magnum. Original bodyguard style shrouded hammer that allows for SA firing without a fully exposed hammer that could sang on clothes or holsters. Currently wearing Altamont checkered classic panels with medallions, also comes with the original case, rubber combat grips, and HKS speedloader. The only thing 'wrong' with it is the front sight pin is sticking ever so slightly out to the right, I just dont have a punch set to knock it back in all the way. Looking to trade for a quality semi-auto pocket pistol, like a P928/P238, Colt Mustang, or Glock 43, but would also consider other similar pistols. I put my trade value in the $500-600 range. If you would prefer to buy, I will sell for $450 FIRM- I feel that's more than fair considering new ones run over $600. FTF in the Winfield/Wellington area preferred but willing to travel as far as Wichita for the right deal. Have my CCL and can sign a bill of sale if desired. The best way to reach me is by text to REDACTED. If the listing is still up, it's still available. NO SHIPPING."

I been kicking this idea around. But if you offer a trade it has to include a set-up ready to shoot, so it must include a pump or bottle.Micro pistols… maybe if you have something interesting. I’d like to stay away from .380 but haven’t ruled them out.Not interested in Black Powder, Pump shotguns, archery, or anything in rough condition. Money can go either way.

I been kicking this idea around. But if you offer a trade it has to include a set-up ready to shoot, so it must include a pump or bottle.Older(70’s) Belgium Browning Hi-PowerMicro pistols… maybe if you have something interesting. I’d like to stay away from .380 but haven’t ruled them out.Not interested in Black Powder, Pump shotguns, archery, or anything in rough condition. Money can go either way.

The guy I bought it from didn't fire it, it looked like the guy he bought it from didn't either. I only put 10 rounds through her, and it's in absolutely amazing condition. Barely has the race mark from the safety on the frame, and internals look brand new. I don't think this thing has had more than 50 rounds through it since it was made, honestly.This is a ban-era AKM, that was made with the thum bhole stock, the muzzle thread removed & the muzzle device taken off like all of the rest of the rifles imported around that time. This gun shoots AWESOME. It's extremely smooth. ONLY reason I'm selling it, is due to an old shoulder injury heavier rifles are harder for me to hold up and fire comfortably. Something this nice deserves to be enjoyed and taken to the range, not sitting in my safe and only coming out every few months eh.This rifle comes with gorgeous (and expensive) red Timber Wolf furniture installed and a Tapco trigger installed, the original thumb hole furniture and original trigger, 2 magazines (Brand new 30 round P-Mag and brand new 20 round P-mag), 30 rounds of PPU 123gr PSP copper ammo (no steel, good to shoot at any range), a standard military style sling, and a soft case.I'm asking $850 FIRM for this. These things usually sell beat up for $850, but for this price you're getting a near mint MAK-90 with a brand new set of $160 furniture, mags, ammo, and an upgraded trigger. This deal is priced low to sell fast.Not looking for trades on this one, cash is king. Best way to contact me is by texting REDACTED at any time or shooting me a PM on here.Face to face deals only, must be 18+. Located in Northville, willing to travel but nothing too far. Thanks for looking!~ Mike"
