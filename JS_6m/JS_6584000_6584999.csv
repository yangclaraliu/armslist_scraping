This rifle sells for $700 + tax at Academy.  6 position telescoping M4-style buttstock with a MIL-SPEC buffer tube and an ergonomic pistol grip with heat-resistant, glass-filled nylon handguards. The rifle has a Dust Cover, Forward assist, Shell deflector, Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug (for many sling and accessory mounting options), handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability, the front sight post is elevation adjustable (front sight tool is included), Ruger Rapid Deploy folding rear sight provides windage adjustability and is a solid reliable aiming system when coupled with the elevation adjustable front sight. The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics but can be instantly redeployed if needed.  The 16.1 inch medium contour barrel is cold hammer-forged providing ultra-precise rifling for exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8 twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger flash suppressor is provided and the ½""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.  The ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow for gloved shooting.   Again, this sells new for $750 at Academy (with tax).  I am asking $650 cash.  Text is best………….417-818-6one66"

The 1:8 twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger flash suppressor is provided and the ½""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.  The ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control.

Beautiful shape.Includes a 1980's Japanese Made Tasco 4x40 airgun scope. This speciality airgun scope was around $100 new back then (yes it was) and includes an AO and Target Turrets. This was the higher quality Tasco's made in Japan and I would put it in the clarity with my Burris or Leupolds. Plus the 40 objective has a wide field of view and gathers light. I used this airgun scope because of the clarity, low recoil from the 22 Magnum, and the AO is adjusted better for a 22 as speed is similiar to that of a high speed airgun. The rings are steel angle lok Millets on a Weaver style base.Includes a military sling and case.This is a great rig for target shooting, coyotes, and woodchucks. I personally like the 22 Magnum better than the 17 HMR as it hits harder with it's 40 grain bullet while almost at the same speed.$450 OBO. NO TRADES PLEASE.Thanks."
