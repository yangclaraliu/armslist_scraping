Also a few minor scratches besides that a great scope !At this point in time I'm more likely to be able to do one or the trades that's closer to the value of the scope .

The Aimpoint Comp 2 4 MOA is used, but good condition and sits on an ARMS-17 Tri-Lock mount.These KS-47s are an AR platform that is chambered in 7.62x39, and accepts any AK magazine. Way cheaper to shoot than firing 5.56 or 223, plus much more punch! If you're unfamiliar with these rifles, check out the video on youtube (PSA KS47 -vs- CMMG Mutant).The PSA KS47 is based on the AR15, and combines the modular construction, accuracy and precision of the AR platform with the stopping power and the magazine options of the AK. While the current AR47 fires the 7.62x39 AK round, it uses modified AR-style magazines that are not nearly as plentiful as AK-style magazines, that were optimized for reliable feeding of the 7.62x39 round. I'm asking $1050 for the rifle, with Aimpoint Comp2 4 MOA, and one steel 30 round magazine. * Drum Magazine not included in the selling price. Would trade for a Sig Sauer P226 MK25."

I had too many revolvers, one of which he really liked, and he had lots of guns for sale. I had handled a Sig P250 he had for sale in the display case while I was looking at his store guns and, liking its feel and having never owned a Sig and enjoying trading guns to get different ones, thought it would be fun to own one. He brought a new in its plastic protective carrying case Sig P250 Compact in 9mm out of his gun safe that included two 15-round magazines and a Sig matching paddle holster I went home with a new gun. I haven't had a chance to fire it yet, but as I was reviewing my gun situation today I decided to post it for sale before I did shoot it to see if there was any interest in a new Sig P250 Compact 9mm at a great price. I have a couple of semi-automatic pistols already so I don't need another one right now, but if this doesn't sell as a new gun I will definitely be taking it out and getting a sense of what it is that makes Sig owners so loyal. I think the DAO trigger will make for a good carry weapon because there is no external safety to deal with and the trigger pull helps to prevent unintended discharge. As mentioned above, this is a new in case Sig Sauer P250 Compact 9mm that features:- Accessory Rail- Two 15 round capacity magazines- Sig Sauer paddle plastic holster- Hard plastic carrying case- DAO trigger- 3 Dot (1 front, 2 rear) White Contrast Sights- Polymer Grip Shell with Stainless Inserts- Nitron Slide FinishBefore you go any further, please verify that you meet the following conditions and are willing and able to provide verifiable contact information in your initial correspondence.I have received many inquiries, some offers, and a couple of ""I'll take it"" emails from folks who did not meet or were not able to verify the following criteria or weren't able to buy right now. This has prevented sales to legitimate would-be purchasers.""Able to complete at this time a local face-to-face cash sale.

I got this in a trade and haven't shot it very much other than at the renge, when I got it, it came from an older gentleman who had bought it and only shot it a couple times, the gun has less than 100 rounds through it, as I personally have put 50 rounds of 38. Special through it and 25 rounds of .357 Magnum, very sweet shooter that has barely any recoil even with Magnum rounds going through it. this is drilled and tapped for sights all you need is a picatinny rail, screws, and a scope and you have a great hunting revolver, very accurate even with the ""Iron"" sights. This is the 6.5"" barrel and Stainless Steel I'm not sure but this might be the model X that you can get a 9mm Parabellum cylinder for. I have 25 round sof Winchester Hollow Points and an unopened box of Federal Premium Hydra-Shok rounds, perfect for carrying in the woods for protection! price includes the ammo gun and holster, the holster is a simple Allen brand holster that I'm ctually very impressed with as the quality is Excellent, light wear if you can call it that, more like the leather softening up.I will not separate any of the listed items, this is a package deal. As I said Cash is King but I am looking to trade for a running and driving car or truck, no preference other than No trashed Transmissions, No trashed Engines. it MUST run and drive and have no ""Needs head gasket"", ""I locked up the Engine"", or ""Only starts in 3rd gear"". other than that Firearms are great, just no black powder pepperbox pistols, or modern BP rifles, mix of guns and cash welcome as well."

This shotgun reflects the heritage and quality that Berretta is known for. The 687 receiver is both strong and low-profile. This is achieved by two conical locking lugs at mid-height, meaning that it will always lock up strongly and positively while not requiring the extra bulk of a top locking lever. The 687 EELL Diamond Pigeon is the highest end shotgun available in the 680-series over-under line. It features beautiful side plates and receiver that are comparable to a master painter’s canvas. The hand-chased engraving and specially-selected walnut stock give this gun an air of respect for its owner. The stock is a classic semi-beavertail with premium European walnut finished with a newly designed fine-line checkering. It also comes with an oval brass shield that is inlaid on the stock for the personalization of the fire arm. This shield can be inlaid with the family crest or initials of its owner. Despite its obvious visual attractors the 687 EELL Diamond Pigeon is built to last. This shotgun will be a piece of family history that can be passed down through the generations with continued stories of its hunting legacy. This is made possible with a chrome-moly cold-hammer forged barrel, a forcing cone that is elongated to provide less shot deformation and recoil and the MobilChoke system that is further designed to resist stress and ensure durability. It also comes with a personalized case that will protect it on its many of what are sure to be great hunts.   Specs  EuroOptic SKU:J687985 Max Shell Length:2 3/4"" Barrel Length:30"" Stock:Premium Select European Walnut Semi-Beavertail Action:Over/under break action Caliber:28 ga"

I also bought a Pearce +1 and a Taran Tactical +1. I was thinking I'd have +1 in my flush mags and +2 in my extension mags. Well, the Magguts in the flush mags get 7 rounds and functioned flawlessly at the range yesterday. However, the Magguts with both kinds of the extended mags DO ALLOW 8 rounds to get into the mag, but the top round is so tight that shooting the gun with a 9th round in the chamber and an 8rd mag caused so much friction on the slide that it never chambered the next round, leaving a spent shell in the chamber. I decided to put the factory followers/springs back in the extended mags (which still help in the pinky department) and keep my Magguts in the flush mags (which are great for pocket carry). I only need two of these. NOTE: I just remembered that I should add the fact that these followers are compatible with all G42 mags, including the newest ""03"" mags."

I got this in a trade and haven't shot it very much other than at the range, when I got it, it came from an older gentleman who had bought it and only shot it a couple times, the gun has less than 100 rounds through it, as I personally have put 50 rounds of 38. Special through it and 25 rounds of .357 Magnum, very sweet shooter that has barely any recoil even with Magnum rounds going through it. this is drilled and tapped for sights all you need is a picatinny rail, screws, and a scope and you have a great hunting revolver, very accurate even with the ""Iron"" sights. This is the 6.5"" barrel and Stainless Steel I'm not sure but this might be the model X that you can get a 9mm Parabellum cylinder for. I have 25 round sof Winchester Hollow Points and an unopened box of Federal Premium Hydra-Shok rounds, perfect for carrying in the woods for protection! price includes the ammo gun and holster, the holster is a simple Allen brand holster that I'm ctually very impressed with as the quality is Excellent, light wear if you can call it that, more like the leather softening up.I will not separate any of the listed items, this is a package deal. As I said Cash is King but I am looking to trade for a running and driving car or truck, no preference other than No trashed Transmissions, No trashed Engines. it MUST run and drive and have no ""Needs head gasket"", ""I locked up the Engine"", or ""Only starts in 3rd gear"". other than that Firearms are great, just no black powder pepperbox pistols, or modern BP rifles, mix of guns and cash welcome as well."
