Very good condition. 20” barrel.
Comes with original box (which is a bit rough) with all packing materials, owner's manual and warranty card showing original purchase date of April 1982.
I decided to refinish the stock some years ago and after I got it stripped and saw how pretty the wood was (IMO) I elected to not re-stain it but just finished it with about 6 coats of Linspeed oil (which if you've even used it is pretty labor intensive). If someone wanted to return it to factory-spec original dark brown it would be trivial and all of the prep work has been done.
There is an area about ½” wide at the midpoint of the barrel on top where the bluing shows wear. No idea what caused that. Also the little notched ramp for elevation adjustment of the rear sight is missing. It was like that when I got it and I never bothered with it. I just looked and the notched ramps are available on Midway website For $1.99.
I've had this rifle about 10 years and have probably put 50 rounds through it. Does nothing but sit and I'm not getting any younger so someone else might as well enjoy it. Price is firm and if you look at what they are selling for on sites like Gun Broker I think you will agree it is fair. I guess these have become sort of collectible as they were only made for 8 years. I've even seen the little manual alone listed for $35."

Like those who are unapologetic about protecting their legacy, the SAINT makes no compromises when it comes to features, engineering, and operator experience.  As the ultimate refinement of the AR-15 form, the SAINT combines innovations like the Accu-Tite receiver mating system with the relentless execution of core features.
The SAINT’s flat top design is optics ready and includes a flip-up rear aperture sight and fixed A2-style front. The 16-inch Chrome Moly Vanadium barrel features a 1:8 twist rate to handle a wide range of bullet types. The operation of the M16 bolt carrier group is managed by a mid-length gas system paired with a heavy tungsten buffer, resulting in an exceptionally smooth action. A good shot starts with the trigger, so that’s why the SAINT features micro-polished and Nickel Boron treated components. While it offers the right pull weight for defensive use, you won’t feel it.
Unlike most defensive rifles in its price range, the SAINT includes top notch furniture designed to improve both shooting experience and operator performance. An all new, exclusive Bravo Company PKMT KeyMod handguard packs heat shields and flexible attachment points into a slim and easy to handle form factor. The Bravo Company buttstock is rattle-free and complemented by a Bravo pistol grip designed to improve defensive performance.
Built for the free and independent, Springfield Armory’s SAINT represents the next generation of America’s personal defense rifle. Built with relentless dedication to reliability, it’ll be ready when you are because you can always trust the SAINT."

It also has metal off set sights and a Harris bipod wirh adjustable and swivel legs. I have also added a set of shims so it returns to zero without bypassing it. It was walked out to 800 yards and scope adjustments added inside the lens cap for easy dialing out to 800. Could definitely shoot further, but that's all the yardage my range has.
