It is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. The VP Series integrates a striker firing system with an enhanced, HK ""light pull"" trigger. HK's cold hammer-forged barrel made from cannon grade steel ensures long service life, as does the polygonal bore profile which also provides a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP uses HK's ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels, accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the pistol's grip position an operator's hand for optimal shooting. An extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame, and the paddle-style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A unique VP feature is HK's patented rear-mounted charging supports on each side of the slide provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK's hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols use proven HK P30 steel magazines. This model has an OD Green frame, black slide with 3-dot sights, and includes two (2), 15-round magazines.

Unlike chrome lining, the Melonite process is a treatment done to the surface instead of adding a layer of material. This treatment is done to both the inside and outside of the barrel. The slick surface will never peel, is thicker than chrome lining, will not negatively affect accuracy as chrome lining does and will reduce the amount of friction created. Less friction equals less bore surface wear which will extend the barrel life. Another added benefit is carbon does not easily adhere to this surface making your cleaning job that much easier. This technology has been used by Glock, Springfield and Heckler & Koch for years and is gaining popularity as more companies are offering their products with this treatment. ALL LAWS APPLY.

For those not familiar with Citadel, it is the upper-tier 1911 line made by Armscor, makers of Rock Island Armory pistols. Citadel 1911's come with slightly different styling, a better finish, and ship with two magazines instead of only one as with RIA handguns. They are made on the same production line, and in fact, this pistol shipped with two magazines marked ""Rock Island"".I got this excellent all-steel pistol as a test and evaluation gun from the importer, and was so impressed with it that I bought it. It tested quite well and has been reliable and accurate with a number of different ammunition types. One of my staff assistants got it as his first 1911 and loved it, but has traded it back to me to help finance an upgrade to a Colt 1911. So, I have it for sale. The pistol comes with its factory box and two seven round magazines. Not included in the sale, but available as a package deal, I also have a set of right hand custom leather including a brand new IWB leather holster and matching magazine pouch, and three (3) Wilson Combat 7 round compact magazines, as well as some carry ammo. These items are not included in the price, but if you want them to complete your system, I will arrange deeply discounted pricing for them.
I will accept reasonable best offers on this firearm, but again, the operative word is ""reasonable"". All trades will be considered as well, but you will do better if you are buying the pistol outright with cash. This handgun is a really good way to see if you want to get into 1911's without mortgaging your house. It also comes with a Lifetime Warranty, with U.S. factory service.
The handgun can be seen and purchased by appointment at my office just outside of Homestead. You will need your ID and be willing to sign a Bill of Sale. All laws complied with."

Unlike chrome lining, the Melonite process is a treatment done to the surface instead of adding a layer of material. This treatment is done to both the inside and outside of the barrel. The slick surface will never peel, is thicker than chrome lining, will not negatively affect accuracy as chrome lining does and will reduce the amount of friction created. Less friction equals less bore surface wear which will extend the barrel life. Another added benefit is carbon does not easily adhere to this surface making your cleaning job that much easier.  This technology has been used by Glock, Springfield and Heckler & Koch for years and is gaining popularity as more companies are offering their products with this treatment.ALL NFA RULES APPLY.

It is used by many rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15 rifles, barrels, and upper receivers. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56x45mm but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition as the case dimensions are the same. In short, it will give you the accuracy of a real SAAMI when using the good ammo, but also allow you to use cheap surplus ball ammo safely. Please Google .223 Wylde if you are unfamiliar with this chamber. It is truly the best of both .223 and 5.56 chambers. Item #: 162W8STFBBL-SS"

It is used by many rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15 rifles, barrels, and upper receivers. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56x45mm but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition as the case dimensions are the same. In short, it will give you the accuracy of a real SAAMI when using the good ammo, but also allow you to use cheap surplus ball ammo safely. Please Google .223 Wylde if you are unfamiliar with this chamber. It is truly the best of both .223 and 5.56 chambers.     Item #: 162W8SPFBBL-SS"

It is used by many rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15 rifles, barrels, and upper receivers. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56x45mm but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition as the case dimensions are the same. In short, it will give you the accuracy of a real SAAMI when using the good ammo, but also allow you to use cheap surplus ball ammo safely. Please Google .223 Wylde if you are unfamiliar with this chamber. It is truly the best of both .223 and 5.56 chambers.   Item Number: 182W8GRDBL-SS"

Three of them are factory 8-round magazines and three are factory 10-round units. (In the third photo, one 8 rounder is in the gun, and the other two 8-rounders are stacked on top of each other in the box). The gun also comes with all the factory accessories it had when new. They are located under the foam in the case and so you can't see them in the pictures, but they are there. This is a commercial production gun and not a law enforcement trade-in. It is spotless.This gun is a joy to shoot and is a real tack-driver. It is only for sale because I have an opportunity to add to my collection of Colt 1911s and need cash to do that. I will consider reasonable best offers and partial trades, but please, no low-ballers. This pistol sells new for over $1,100 so this is a great chance to save some money if you appreciate quality.
The pistol may be seen by appointment at my office just outside of Homestead. You will need proper ID and be willing to sign a Bill of Sale. All laws complied with."

I don't think there's any blue on the steel but the plum brown isn't pitted or crusty. While I've owned it for over 20 years, I don't remember ever shooting it. The action feels tight and crisp and the bore has good rifling though it's not bright or shiney. The extractor works properly but I'm not sure about the firing pin. The barrel is stamped J.STEVENS A&T CO., CHICOPEE FALLS, MASS.,USA, PAT APR 1794?, 22LONG RIFLE, and it has a 3 digit serial #.

SAM7SF
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7SF. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its unique right-side folding tubular buttstock to its 24x1.5mm muzzle threads with muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7SF is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7SF rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.
Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7SF receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process."
