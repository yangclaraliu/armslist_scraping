The Kadet adapter features all-steel construction and an adjustable rear sight.Included are (2) 10-round magazines that fit flush with grips of the full size CZ 75 and SP-01 models.  The Kadet conversion kit will work on the CZ 75 full-size and compact models including the 75, 85, SP-01, 75 Compact, P-01, P-06,  and PCR, but note that the full-size magazines will extend out of the bottom of the shorter grips on these models. The Kadet conversion will not work on the 97, 75 TS, 2075 RAMI, SP-01 Phantom, P-07 or P-09 models. Pre-B model 75s may or may not function with the Kadet due to differing magwell dimensions.When used on an aluminum-framed compact model (PCR, P-01 and P-06) as well as the steel-framed Compact .40, a specific slide-stop is required for proper last-round hold-open (part number REDACTED, available at no charge through our parts department). On 85 models, the 85 slide stop must be used but will not enable last-round hold-open.When used in competition-oriented or modified 75 series pistols like the Shadow, a factory-weight 75 mainspring may be required to provide proper primer ignition.The above description is from CZ directly and photos are stock photos."

Extremely low recoil results in quick and accurate firing. The FN Five-seveN MK2 pistol can accept up to 20 rounds in the magazine. The light weight of the slide and barrel, made possible by the 5.7mm calibre, and the reduced weight of the cartridge make the loaded weapon much lighter than traditional handguns.

This one's serial number gives it an 1950 date of manufacture.  It is in really good shape.  This gun has been used for what it was designed, giving it a slight bluing wear at the end of the barrel, other than that the bluing is in great shape.  It has Pachmayr grips that are in good shape.  Feel free to email me with any questions and I'll get back to you as quickly as I can.  Asking $650 OBRO.

The bolt carrier itself is plated with Titanium Nitride, which is the yellow-gold color you see in the pictures below. TiN is an extremely hard ceramic material, often used as a coating on titanium alloys, tool steel, stainless steel, carbon steel and other metallic components to improve the substrate's surface properties.  Common applications include aerospace parts, military components, medical implants, cutting tools, industrial parts, manufacturing dies / molds and dental and orthodontic appliances.  TiN is a beautiful gold color and is often used as a wear resistant alternative to elemental gold plating.  Applied as a thin coating, TiN is used to provide a hard surface to protect cutting and sliding surfaces and for decorative purposes (due to its gold appearance).  It is also used as a non-toxic barrier on the exterior of medical implants and jewelry.  TiN has a low coefficient of friction and an operating temperature of more than 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit.  In most applications a coating of less than 5 micrometers (0.00020 in) is applied.   We apply TiN using a technique called cathodic arc PVD, or physical vapor deposition.  This method is environmentally friendly and produces a functional coating unlike some other methods which are strictly decorative in nature.  Our coatings comply with aerospace specification AMS 2444A. Benefits of TiN coating:   Hard, scratch and wear resistant Lubricious, corrosion and chemical resistant Beautiful gold color No appreciable build-up to interfere with firearm operation Cost effective alternative to Gold plating"

My loss is your gain.
MSRPs are $138.95 for the chest rig, and $120.95 for the back panel.That would be $259.90 for the both of these.
I have a strict personal standard that I never sell anything used, even if barely, for more than 40% off MSRP.
My price is therefore firm.

Here is some stock info from Warrior Assault Systems regarding these products:
 
901 Elite Ops Base Chest Rig Coyote TanW-EO-901-Z-CT
Overview
The Warrior Elite Ops 901 Front Opening Base (Patent Pending) MOLLE  platform has revolutionized the usage of the modern Chest platform. The 901 base has always been the basis for all the 901 rigs and we all know how good this kit is when used in an SF Role. The only draw back has always been that you need your buddy to help you fit it correctly before each Op. That’s why Warrior with the help of current SF Operators have introduced this variant which is a front opening system comprising a heavy duty size 10 zip, 2 inch full Velcro closure and backed up by 3 press studs for additional security. This allows the user to get in and out of the rig at speed and without any assistance.
You can use this base to build your own configuration by adding a wide assortment of Warrior MOLLE Pouches. This is the latest version with 3D Spacer Mesh Lining for comfort and cooling, the new wider upper folding section is now 6 MOLLE loops wide allowing larger items such as Command Panel to be attached. This wider upper section now also allows a 10 x 12 Inch Ballistic Plate to be worn, turning the 901 into a versatile armour carrier.
 Is also compatible with the Warrior Back Panel.
