The Kushnapup Bullpup Stock in its factory original application is designed for use with the  Saiga 12, 20 gauge and .410 Shotguns and the Catamount Fury 12 gauge Shotgun and certain designs of the AK47.Copy this < photos.shutterfly.com/album/REDACTED9/full/REDACTED1 > then Paste into URL browser / address bar for more PHOTOS.
The company only makes the 1 version and buyers are instructed to make certain fitment adjustments as is deemed necessary for any particular gun.
This particular stock was custom fitted for the Fury I.
1) Since the Fury has the Weaver/Picatinny rail on the receiver's bolt cover that part or the Kushnapup was removed as can be seen in the photos which I can email to you.
2) Also the opening on the bottom for the receiver needed a very small amount removed due to the slight size difference between the Saiga and the Fury.
3) Also a very slight amount of material was removed from the hand grip for clearance of the Fury I five and 10 round magazines since they rock into place, vs the Fury II which slips in. That modification is hardly noticeable.
4) The customizing also includes the installation of 2 picatinny / Weaver rails on each side of the fore grip to which one can add accessories such as a light or a sight.
I mounted a quick detachable rail that cantilevered over the rear sight and mounted a holographic reflex red/green dot type of sight which worked very well since this stock raises the shooters sight orientation too high to make good use of the standard iron sights. [I included 1 photo with this arrangement with the Fury in the stock and with the mounted reflex sight for illustration purposes only.]
NOTE: This listing is only for the Customized Kushnapup Stock only. Photos with other items, like the gun and the sights are not included! [sorry - but its required to mention this for obvious or not so obvious reasons]
Will be shipped in its original box with included owner's instruction manual. Contact me for payment.

This was my personal baby; I planned to use it as my 'yote gun. I have some additional extras you can add for a nominal cost of you want to make this a COMPLETELY upgraded rifle. Radical Firearms lower assembly made in Texas with a LUTH-AR skeleton fixed stock and an Ergo overmolded grip--one of THE MOST comfortable on the market, in my opinion. Hardened Arms upper with an 18"" mid-length HBAR 1:9 twist melonited barrel.I have multiple Radical Firearms and Hardened Arms rifles (556, 300 Blackout, 6.5 Grendel) and all of them are sub-MOA tack drivers. On the upper I swapped the 10"" quad rail for a 15"" USA-made Guntec ultraslim, lightweight keymod handguard. 18"" barrel is perfect for varmints, targets, or whatever you want to do. 1:9 twist with the longer barrel provides enough twist and barrel to run everything from 40-77gr bullets accurately. HBAR configuration with the lightweight handguard gives the perfect balance for shooting--great harmonics and stability of a heavier barrel for the best accuracy, but light enough to be comfortable to carry out in the field. Comes a standard A2 birdcage flash hider (melonited with chatter on it, or phosphate coated without chatter marls)I replaced the gritty, milspec trigger with a brand new Palmetto State Armory Nickel Boron fire control group with reduced weight spring. Trigger is nice and smooth with just a hint of creep, then breaks cleanly amd reliably at 4.5#. I've shot much pricier single stage triggers that didn't feel nearly as nice. I initially planned to upgrade to a $150-200 single stage, but once I finished the trigger job on this, I saw no need. The extra money wouldn't buy me anything better.I also added a melonited extended front take-down pin. Makes disassembly much easier. Additionally, I replaced the trigger pins with anti-walk pins to keep them in there no matter what angle you shoot from.Lower has a few subtle red highlights--Seekins oversize trigger guard and extended mag release button, and a Strike Industries red charging handle with extended handle (for your convenience when you add your own optic). Just enough to be different, without being overbearing bling.I love the LUTH-AR stock and have another one on my Grendel. You can use as is (I've got some cheek/comb risers I can throw in if you want them--just ask), OR for about $60, you can buy the optional adjustable comb and butt pad package and turn it into a fully-adjustable sniper stock, similar to the Magpul version; check Amazon or elsewhere I've read reviews claiming the LUTH-AR adjustable parts aren't as solid as the Magpul, but once you tighten the bolts down, it's rock-solid...and only $60 vice $280, but to each their own. I've got Magpul stocks, including a higher end stock. Love them, but don't find the LUTH-AR lacking in any way, FWIW.I haven't fired this set up outside of some dry firing. I am including also a brand new Palmetto State bolt carrier group that I had purchased for a different build (will need the packing grease cleaned up). The BCG I had set up in it (used to dry fire practice with) was one I'd used briefly in a Blackout and want to give you everything brand new.I can replace the red highlights with black ones if you prefer for no cost. I have an oversized black trigger guard (not Seeking, but solid) and have an extra black mag release button and a brand new black Strike extended latch charging handle.ADD ONS: If you want additional add-ons, I have these for sale and would be happy to replace the parts on the current set up before selling you the rifle (please email if you want picss:-- Rock River Arms 2 stage trigger $125. I have an extra two stage if you prefer it. For just the cost of the trigger I'll install it for ya.-- Sniper grip. Nice, ergonomic, overmolded grip with a palmswell and hand shelf. Not Ergo brand, but similar to their design and quality (I have both, and this is just as good, just a little less refined). Ergo costs $70, but I'll replace the current grip with this for $30-- Custom ""Breacher"" stainless single chamber muzzle brake. True muzzle brake, though looks like it might be designed to hide flash as well. This cost $65, but I'll swap it out for the birdcage for $35.-- Rear extended take down pin. I am happy to sell you the pin for $5. If you want me to install it, $15. The rear pin is a hassle to install, or I'd have done it myself already. I bought a rear pin to.match the front pin, but didn't get around to disassembling the buffer tube assembly just to put this in. I was saving to use on a future build.-- Ambidextrous safety, $30. Palmetto State Armory safety, that ran me $20+ shipping. It's a pain to install, since I need to take out the trigger assembly it get the safety to drop out.-- AR soft case for $25.Willing to ship to your FFL (cost of postage) if you prefer--your dealer must accept shipment from a private individual If not, it's $30 + shipping  to send from  my FFL. Otherwise, face to face with VA residents. Must be over 21 and willing to provide copy of VA driver's license (or military ID) and preferably also your CC permit.

Please read carefully so we can make this painless as possible. I have in my possession a DDI Arms 47s. It has 405 rounds fired through it without issue. It's been spray painted with green and brown stripes, it doesn't look bad at all. With this rifle I will include a Midwest Industries QD side mount and an Aimpoint Comp4. With the Aimpoint I will include an American Defense QD mount. Now, the only issue is that I broke the safety lever trying to make it more ""snug"" to the reciever. This doesn't affect the rifle in anyway, just needs a new safety for a stamped receiver which will cost 14 bucks. I'm getting rid of all my guns and honestly don't want to mess with it. So with the broken safety lever and the spray paint, I'm only asking $850 for everything. Will include original box and PMAG that came with the rifle. That's a hell of a deal once you price this stuff separately. Serious buyers only! No trades at this time. I can provide links to a new safety and pictures upon request. Price is firm. Thanks for looking. *Will come with original furniture*"

It is a tack driver .22 target pistol! It was given to me many years ago and I'm told by a vintage gun shop (via my pics) it is in shooter grade - though I may put it a little higher than that. Regardless, it is a very nice gun!
It comes with:
Original Colt box
Original Colt pamphlet 
Original Colt test pattern
Original paper cloth
Original - unused - extra rear (palm) grip in paper baggy
Original Colt screwdriver tool
Original magazine
Leather holster (I don't know if it is original or not, but it is fit to the gun)
The only knock on the gun is a number inscribed on the inside of the handle and bottom of the grip. My buddy can't remember what the numbers were for, but they're there and it is priced accordingly. Currently there is one under the glass at the Bass Pro boutique gun room for $1200. 
I'd like to get $700 obo or trade toward a larger caliber (10mm, 45acp, .357, .44) pistol. I am not interested in compact models and a longer slide is a plus.

I am the original (1st) owner and have only put roughly 100 rounds down range with it! Main reason I am selling, is I just simply don't use it as much due to personal preference, and figured it isn't doing me much good just sitting around in the safe! If you are interested in buying, all I would need is to see a valid form of MN or Military ID, as well as a Permit to Purchase. We would meet in a public parking lot to fulfill both of our safety needs. Cheers,Kyle"

It is a .40-caliber Flintlock that was probably made in the ‘70’s. The bore seems to be clean and from what I see, has good rifling. I haven’t shot it so I can’t speak as to accuracy or ease of loading. The barrel is 13/16 x 41 ¾-inches long. The length of pull to the front trigger is 15-inches. The triggers have to be set to trip the lock. The lock holds good on both half and full cock and throws good sparks. There are several brass inlays in the stock that have turned dark. The stock has bumps and dings as to be expected with a used rifle, but no cracks or breaks. There is a brass shim soldered between the lock and the barrel with the touch hole going through it. I don’t know if the lock didn’t make good contact with the barrel or if it was put there to protect the barrel. Let me know if you have any questions or need additional pictures. Call or text me to see it at 479-72one-two035. Please, not calls before 7am or after 10pm."
