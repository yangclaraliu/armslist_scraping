The Hitchner Corporation cast a heavy revolver frame using 4140 Steel, app. 10% more substantial than its contemporaries- Ruger Blackhawk and S&W. These Dragoon revolvers were built to very close tolerances and hand fitted and individually tuned and lock up tighter than almost any other single action ever made, similar to the individual quality of the colt line of Pythons. The large bolt and cylinder stops contribute greatly to these quality features. A Swiss Safety was incorporated into the design along with cylinder dots drilled to the left and right of one bore to indicate the empty chamber, also quite unique to the Dragoon. The revolver has adjustable rear sights with walnut grips that show no sign of wear. Other features include one piece back strap, brazed front sight, recessed cylinders, coil mainspring, internal firing pin, split grip panels, and unlike Ruger, Interarms used a locked firing pin busing on the Dragoon. The list price in the early 80's when this was made was 280.00 whereas the Blackhawk, 10% less substantial in structure, was only 200.00. The cost of hand fitting and tuning each one of these Dragoons individually along with other excellent unique features left the Dragoon at a price point of $80.00 above the MSRP of the Blackhawk. These extras put an impact on the overall sales of the Dragoon and production was haulted in 1985."

LNIB (100%) condition, the pistol looks brand new no scratches, chips, marks, bore is clean, etc. I used the pistol in an indoor range, never holstered, only high quality new MFR ammo, no bi-metal, steel case or reman ammo used. I bring 3-4 pistols during a range session and I fire 50 rnds per pistol; I clean my pistols after each session. This is a proven pistol that is very accurate (tack driver) that did not have a single failure to feed, fire or eject. I used high quality products to maintain the pistol: M-Pro 7 Cleaner, M-Pro 7 LPX oil in the bore, Tetra or TW25B grease on wear/bearing points. Cleaning equipment had coated wires/rods or non-metal handles to protect the bore and finish. The pistol was stored in a temp/moisture controlled environment (68-72 F) with desiccants. The lifetime warranty follows the pistol and I checked the s/n for recalls as it is not registered with FNH-USA. The price for the pistol and magazine is $599.00 FTF (in person), includes shipping to your FFL extra for AK (FFL must accept shipment from me) or I can ship Via FFL buyer pays shipping; OBO.

Designed for lightness with aluminum alloy receiver. 6 lbs 12 oz A profile of performance. The exquisite profile of this over under shotgun exemplifies the genius of John M. Browning. His first invention, the Single Shot Model, looked similar to this Browning Citori Superlight Feather. So did versions of the original Superposed, from which this gun descended. The reason is obvious to most -- with its straight grip stock the shooter can move his hand to any position for balance, comfort and maneuverability. And speed! The lack of a pistol grip and recoil pad, along with the substitution of light weight alloy for a usual steel receiver -- make this model the sleek, nimble-handling sports car of the over under shotgunning shooting world. Designed specifically for fast flushing targets. For any upland game like quail, grouse, pheasant, chukar, woodcock or gray partridge, this is the shotgun that knows its way around. It is fast to the shoulder, fast swinging on birds that flush like lightning. It's lightweight and easy to carry, and a perfect choice for covey game, especially in it's smaller gauges.Shipping available."

This is a commander sized 1911, 4.25"" barrel.  White dot front sight, all black serrated rear.  Short reach trigger, skeletonized commander hammer, flared bearvertail and black rubberized grips.  That's how the pistol came, now for the customizations, all of which were perfomed by a certified gunsmith.Slide work: Back end of slide is serrated to reduce glare, 11 degree target crown blended into barrel bushing, ejection port was lowered and flared, the extractor was tuned and the Marvel cut was added to smooth out the action.Frame work:The fronstrap was hand checkered to 30 LPI, as were the front of the trigger gaurd and the bump on the grip safety.  Also, the mainspring housing, mag catch and reciol spring plug were replaced with chekered ones.  Trigger job to about 4 pounds, minimal take up and breaks like a glass rod.  The trigger gaurd is undercut and the beavertail was raised, making it incredibly comfortable in the hand and also giving it great pointability.  The beavertail was radiused to give it a sleeker look, as was the the thumb safety.  Also, the thumb safety, grip safety and frame have been blended together to be one smooth curve.  Again, super comfortable in the hand.  Idiot proofed the slide stop (makes for easy installation and eliminates the chance for the infamous idiot scratch).  The magwell has been beveled as well.It was recently Cerakoted.  The Slide, frame and mainspring houseing are Tungsten (metallic dark grey), all other parts and pins are Cobalt (metallic black).  It's a pretty slick looking firearm.  It comes with 3 mags.  One Springfield 7 round that works great, an 8 round ACT mag that could use a new spring.  The first round tends to nose dive but cycles fine after that.  Also a 10 round promag that I picked up in a trade.  It looked like someone went at with some pliers and I was rather skeptical of it.  It worked surprising well though.  Sticks a bit on the release.  As you can see, quite a bit of work has been put into this little fella and I'm asking a more than fair price. So no lowball offers please."

Then stock has been oiled throughout its lifetime so it's not dried out. The bolt is still the early straight model. The finish is original hand burnished bluing and has not been parked or re worked. All hardware is correct to the rifle, the receiver bears a ""hatcher hole"" on the left side which are sometimes associated with USMC rifles. The sling is an original M1907 dated 1918.
