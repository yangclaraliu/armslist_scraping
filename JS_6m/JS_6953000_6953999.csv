Modeled after the FNP™-45 service pistol introduced in 2007 under the U.S. Joint Combat Pistol Program, the FNX™-45 is a double-action/single-action hammer-driven pistol with highly enhanced ergonomics. Its manual safety/decocking levers, slide stop lever and magazine release are all fully ambidextrous for ease of operation with either hand and from any firing position. Both the slide and barrel are stainless steel. The FNX™-45’s checkered polymer frame has multiple interchangeable backstraps with lanyard eyelets.

Looking to sell my Howa 1500 in 7mm Rem Mag. Has a Vortex Crossfire II 4-12 mounted on top, currently zeroed at 100yds. I've put 90 rounds through the rifle, though I bought it used, so I'm not sure how much went through it beforehand. Barrel still appears to be in good shape, shooting showed no erratic performance. I still have 89 of the fired casings if you reload. Also included are 30 rounds of Barnes Vor-TX, one half box (pictured) and one unopened box. Three types of ammo were put through the rifle. 40rnds of Remington, 40 of Winchester, and 10 Barnes. Reason for selling is that I'm new to shooting long range. I picked this up for a great deal (employee discount ftw), but it kicks too much for me to learn how to actually shoot properly, so I'm swapping for something smaller before I develop bad habits. $500 OBO.

For those who emphasize extra-discreet concealed carry, they're proud to introduce the new Springfield Armory EMP Lightweight Champion with Concealed Carry Contour. Back in 2007, the original Springfield Armory EMP set a new bar for quality, performance, and style. Combining the new-perfect ergonomics of the time-tested 1911 design with a new patented short-action, the original EMP redefined what a carry 1911 could be. Amont the community of those who know, it has earned a reputation as one of the most shootable compact pistols ever. The all new EMP 4"" Lightweight Champion with Concealed Carry Contour model improves on the original by combining a longer barrel with a frame trimmed for ultimate concealment. The new bevel cut on the mainspring housing does a lot more than one might think. The rounded contour molds to the shape of the shooters hand, preventing ""palm bite"" during fire. For carry, the contoured shape helps to prevent snags during the draw and virtually eliminates the telltale buldge under a cover garment. Now, the EMP is easier than ever to conceal. The new Concealed Carry Contour model features a four-inch, stainless steel, Match-Grade bull barrel with a fully supported feed ramp. The barrel is housed in a forged stainless steel slide with an exquisite satin finish. The slide assembly is complemented by a black hard coat anodized forged aluminum alloy frame. The front fiber optic sight facilities instant sight acqusition while the low-profile combat-style rear sight ensures a smooth draw from concealment. The EMP Lightweight Champion with Concealed Carry Contour handles even better than it looks. Checkered balck G-10 grips panels combine a slip-free hold with imcomparable durability. Both front and rear strap frame surfaces feature their smooth, but effective, Posi-Lock texturing pattern. Your EMP will come packaged in a premium carry case with three 9-round magazines offering a loaded carry capacity of ten rounds of 9mm, Check out the all new Springfield Armory EMP Lightweight Champion with Concealed Carry Contour. You'll never carry a 1911 pistol the same way again.

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.6” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

This is an original MOD issue PLCE long back bergen. The originals were green before they started making them in DPM. That and the fact that this is a long back make it a little harder to come by. I bought it from a surplus dealer in the UK over a year ago and haven't used it. Obviously it is not a new pack. It's been issued a few times by the looks of the names written on the unit and name area on the back of it. The pack is in good working order with no rips or tears that I could find. One of the removable side pouches looks to have had the bottom fastex type buckles cut off. I have no explanation for this. It's only on one side. Both buckles on the side pouch are gone and one buckle from the pack itself. The weight bearing fastex buckles at the top as well as the heavy duty attachment zippers are intact. This doesn't seem to effect the functioning of the pack but I wanted to mention it. Cash price is $45 ftf. I'm up west of Woodland Park in the Cripple Creek area but I could meet in the Springs. I'd be ok shipping it on the buyers dime but remember it's a large pack so that might not be cost effective.

With the intuitive operation of a 1911-style thumb safety, the Micro Bel Air gets on target quickly, when fractions of a second count. The aluminum frame keeps weight down for comfortable carry and resists corrosion from carrying the pistol close to the body. Low profile sights provide quick sight acquisition and interfere minimally when drawing the weapon from a holster or purse. A match-grade aluminum trigger offers a consistently crisp pull for accurate shot placement. The Kimber Micro Bel Air is an extremely lightweight and compact semi-auto pistol that conceals easily and deploys instantly."
