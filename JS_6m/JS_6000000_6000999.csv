I shoot handgun and .223. Not looking for anything fancy, just a spot I can bring my paper/steel targets and shoot for a couple hours every other week or so. I'm hopeful to find someone willing to let me shoot on their property for about what it would cost to join a gun club ($100-200/year). I am a law enforcement officer in the Milwaukee area, responsible shooter and would clean up my range equipment, brass, etc. Just looking for a place to shoot on my own, run some advanced drills most gun clubs can't accomodate/don't allow. Shoot me an email through Armslist if you have some space to shoot on. I am looking for an area within 30-45 minutes of the Waukesha/Milwaukee county border. Thank you!"

The night sights are metal, Glock branded, white dots (front and back) that glow green. I beleive they're made by Meprolight. It's in very good condition. The slightest signs of wear here or there, but hardly noticeable. It's had less than 6k rounds through it, so it's really not even broken-in fully yet. Runs great, no problems whatsoever. It comes with an Uncle Mike's holster and dual mag holder. The holster has the paddle-style belt loops on it that can be slid over the belt, as does the mag carrier. It also has a more low-profile belt mount that can be switched for a more traditional, everyday carry. Great starter setup for IDPA or 3-Gun. It also comes with all the original accessories: 3 Glock mags, 2 backstraps (the large one is on in the photos), tool for changing backstraps, the Glock speed loader that really saves your fingers when loading mags, original paperwork and the shell from the test-fire at the factory. Plus some additional items I have: a rubber grip that can be put on if you like more of a rubber-grip feel and a plug that goes in the open space behind the mag well (can only be used without a backstrap on).All this gear is in great condition. It's a great setup and will serve you well. It's lightly used and practically brand new. You get a great deal on the whole set, since I'm a minimalist and am switching primary sidearms. It's a great weapon.Call or text. Serious buyers and cash only. Concealed carry license or similar evidence you're legal to own a gun preferred."

(The XD-S is a concealable model, smaller than full-size) Has maybe ten rounds shot through it at most, with zero problems experienced when shooting it. It is still in the box with the receipt and everything that it came with from factory. That includes 2 magazines, one is the factory 7 round mag that keeps the pistol small and then there is the factory 8 round magazine that actually extends the pistol grip to the same shape and size as the full-size Springfield XD pistol.  The gun is a compact model, not tiny but smaller than a full size pistol and made to be very concealable.This Springfield is leaps and bounds above other pistols in quality of material and craftsmanship. I compared this to a different 9mm handgun of about the same cost and couldn't believe the difference in them.If you don't buy this one, look at a Springfield brand anyway before buying your conceal carry pistol, the difference is felt the moment you pick it up.I'm selling this for $85.00 below purchase price. Glad to show the receipt to the buyer.One last note: I noticed on the Internet that there is a 4 year old recall for some XD models, this gun is not part of that. This gun is new, and is 3million digits higher in serial number than the largest number of affected guns.Highest affected serial number was 900,000 and something, this gun's serial number is in the 3 millions.Thanks.$385.00"
