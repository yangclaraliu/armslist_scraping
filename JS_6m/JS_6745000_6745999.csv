The foam has been plucked to accommodate this rifle and scope with bipod installed, and also had a cut out for my suppressor, two 20 round boxes of ammo, and a Glock 19.  You may want to replace the foam and pluck to fit your loadout.Total investment if you bought everything separate would be around $900.  Obviously, I don't expect to get everything back out of it that I've put in it, but, I do think that my asking price of $550 is more than fair *considering* the accessories included. That's basically what you'd pay for the rifle new and it's like getting the stock, scope, bipod, cheek riser, and case for free. Not a bad deal.$550 cash, or $650 trade value. Will consider trades depending on what you have- no shotguns but anything with threaded barrels would be considered.  H&k pistols, Sig pistols, threaded 1911, etc. No Tauruses!  Just text and let me know what you've got....we can deal.

TP9v2 is a solid choice for Law Enforcement agencies or any enthusiast who wants a full sized pistol that delivers performance in the harshest conditions. The TP9v2 features a cold hammer forged barrel, an ambidextrous top-slide-mounted decocker, fixed 3-Dot steel sights, interchangeable backstraps, striker status indicator, reversible magazine catch and an MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail. Unlike standard double actions once the decocker is engaged the pistol can still be fired in double action mode making this pistol both safe and versatile. Comes with two 18 rd. mags., two interchangeable backstraps, cleaning rod, brush and a limited lifetime manufacturer's warranty In addition to the mags that came with the gun. I will include 1 additional new 18rd mag for a total of 3 per gun. Again I have two of these for sale and before anyone asks, I decided to go the .40cal route, so that's why I'm selling. I would like to get $275 for each gun or I will sell both for $525. I'm located in southern York county and prefer to do the transfer at either gun bunker or freedom armory.

This 6 digit /26\ marked Type 56 was likely manufactured just after April 1957, when Jianshe Arsenal first started using the /26\ marking. The carbine has been completely cleaned of Cosmoline down to disassembly of the bolt and cleaning out the firing pin channel. This Type 56 has an unnumbered beechwood stock, reflecting its time in Albania, that has nice fish scale flecking and a single hole buttplate. The stock is solid with a lot of character from various well executed repairs.  This C&R eligible very early Chinese Type 56 SKS was originally provided to Albania as military aid in the early 60’s. These early Chinese SKSs are all milled construction, including the trigger groups, unlike the later Norincos, and have long-lugged threaded barrels. The barrels are also chrome-lined ensuring that these have very good to excellent condition bores! Many SKS collectors and shooters consider these to be the finest quality Chinese SKSs.  Shipping $35 for CONUS (the lower 48 states minus CA). California, Alaska and Hawaii may require extra funds from the buyer for shipping and or paperwork (CA). For those states, I will charge actual shipping (+$10 for CA) and will send you a picture of the UPS receipt showing the actual cost."

This 6 digit /26\ marked Type 56 was likely manufactured just after April 1957. Nice Albanian one hole beechwood stock. Stable ""cracks"" on the right side of the buttstock. A lot of TRENCH ART on the left side!  This FFL-03/C&R ELIGIBLE very early Chinese Type 56 SKS was originally provided to Albania as military aid in the early 60’s. These early Chinese SKSs are all milled construction, including the trigger groups, unlike the later Norincos, and have long-lugged threaded barrels. The barrels are also chrome-lined ensuring that these have very good to excellent condition bores! Many SKS collectors and shooters consider these to be the finest quality Chinese SKSs.   SHIPPING $35 for CONUS (the lower 48 states, minus CA). California, Alaska and Hawaii may require extra funds from the buyer for shipping and or paperwork (CA). For those states, I will charge actual shipping (+$10 for CA) and will send you a picture of the UPS receipt showing the actual cost."

The new AR-30A1 is the sought after target version and a standard version chambered in .300 Win Mag. On the surface, the AR-30A1 bears a family resemblance to its predecessor, the AR-30. But, every individual component of the AR-30 was scrutinized in the AR-30A1. As a result, only the pistol grip, buttpad, trigger, and a few small components from the AR-30 passed muster for the AR-30A1. All other components are new and/or improved. The result is a firearm that maintains its predecessor’s outstanding accuracy, light weight, and soft recoil while dramatically improving its ergonomics, adaptability, versatility, reliability and ease of use. Features of all versions of the new AR-30A1: Muzzle brake threads on the end of the barrels employ threads that are standard for the sound suppressor industry (5/8 x 24 for the 300 Win Mag, many sound suppressors can be screwed directly onto the barrel without the need for an adaptor. The 24” barrel of the .300 Win Mag balances ballistic performance with portability. A tough, through-hardened receiver means reduced wear and increased smoothness. The bolt-mounted safety mechanism locks the firing pin to the rear. This design is stronger and more secure than a sear or trigger blocking safety because it directly blocks the firing pin itself. The metal cheekpiece is very durable and the elastomeric cheekpiece pad provides a comfortable shooter interface in all weather conditions."

This is the M1 (sometimes called Classic) with Euro-style ambi paddle mag release and front rail (for light or laser).The pistol is completely stock and comes with the original factory steel 7-round and 8-round magazines, factory box (serialed to pistol) and original box contents (i.e. manual, both backstraps (medium is installed), and lock). I am the original owner and purchased this pistol as a backup to my carry gun. Fired 200 rounds over a few range trips as part of my regular protocol for testing a new gun (e.g. function check, feeding of different hollow-point self-defense ammo). Shoots like a dream. Very accurate. Thoroughly cleaned and inspected after range trips. Lubricated per factory recommendations.Concealed Carry Package Deal(1) Pistol, box, 2 mags (7-round, 8-round, these came with pistol), as described above.(2) Three additional Walther factory magazines. One (1) six-round mag. Two (2) eight-round mags. This will let you try out the most compact config, and also have the largest capacity mags for practicing at the range.(3) Dark Star Gear clip-on AIWB holster, black, right-handed, see http://darkstargear.com/kydex-gear/aiwb/. (4) JM Custom Kydex AIWB single mag holder, black, for right-handed shooter, left side carry, see http://www.jmcustomkydex.com/p/AIWB-SPMP.html.Asking $425 cash FTF for package.Good-looking, high-quality pistol, great for concealed carry and a joy to shoot (not true of many single stack guns). The intended use case for this carry setup is ""casual carry"", with no belt, secure, but easy-on, easy-off. Think gym shorts for quick errands, run to the store, etc. If you haven't found a quick, convenient carry setup that you like yet, don't miss this opportunity to pick up a terrific, like-new carry gun, at a low-risk package price, to try it out. I live in Birmingham, but travel to Huntsville and Mobile regularly. I can provide proof (e.g. pistol permit) that I am a good guy and as many references as you need from recent firearms transactions. Deal with confidence. I won't waste your time, please don't waste mine.Thanks for looking!P.S. Don't forget to ask me about my pay-it-forward list."

The Woodsman is still considered one of the best Colt's ever built (designed in part by John Browning) and is an enjoyable piece to have as a collectable in and of itself. 2nd Series are also unique in that they have the push-button magazine release.
