I've decided to only have guns with a thumb safety in my home.  I know the arguments for and against using a manual safety, but I want that extra level of control, especially with respect to young children.  I would consider a trade for a new, in the box, S&W M&P 2.0 9mm with a thumb safety.  All other trades will be ignored, as well as unreasonable cash offers. If you are not in North Carolina or can't meet me in person, shipping to your FFL of choice is extra.

I built her in 300 blk originally but sold the upper. Now she's complete but I have no desire to shoot her. Kinda sad but that's why I'm putting her up. Hopefully she'll go to somebody that can give her all the range time she needs. Her upper is fairly standard. Milspec BCG lined up with a 16"", 1 in 8 twist barrel. A standard bird cage flash suppressor caps it off.Smith & Wesson Lower Reciever with an Armalite match trigger and Hogue Grip as well as a Heavy buffer and Enhanced Carbine Recoil Spring from Damage Industries are the guts for the lower. A Utility/Battle Rifle (UBR) stock from Magpul tops off the lower for a rediculously comfortable and consistant shooter.Currently she hasn't seen any shooting but, depending on how long this ad is up, I might put a mag or two through just to give her something."
