Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

Barrel has not been cut, and still retains its Winchester marking as well as production date of 1-19, so an after World War 1 barrel possible a replacement.

For many years AR and AK pistols (among others) were considered to be a novelty by firearms enthusiasts. The weight of the platform and the power of the .223 and 7.62x39 rounds made them impractical to use and achieve repeatable accuracy. That all changed in 2013 with the arrival of several innovative products designed to improve stability and ergonomics. With these simple improvements the platform quickly went mainstream. Among these products is the Thordsen Customs AR/AK Pistol Cheek Rest Kit.
This kit is a Hybrid design utilizing either our Standard or Enhanced Buffer Tube Cover kits and the Mission First Tactical EVOLV Battle Stock Attachment. The MFT EVOLV, and Buffer Tube Cover, are now pre-assembled in house, and mounted directly to the buffer tube using a specially designed steel bracket and adapter kit. The result is a rock solid, ergonomic cheek weld that provides stability for accurate, repeatable shooting, and a proper sight line for your favorite optics or sights.EXCELLENT CONDITIONShips with: Tube, Saddle/Cover, Hardware and Carbine Buffer Spring.Not included:Buffer, End Plate, Castle NutBuyer to pay actually shipping cost which will be available within 48 hours of sale."

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.Notice: Due to potential cyclical problems involving recoil energy, Diamondback Firearms does not recommend the use of any 9mm SAMMI Specification ammunition in bullet weights exceeding 124 grain.The use of +P, +P+, reloaded, or NON-SAMMI Spec ammunition will void the firearms warranty.DISCLAIMER: Crimson Trace Corporation© DB .380 specific laser mount is not designed for the DB9.

This has the custom wood grips, come from the factory with just front night sight, but I installed a whole matching set. So, brand new night sights. 2 mags and everything from the factory, listing cash and trade value at $900 and I have more than this in it with the nights sights, so am taking a $100 loss so really firm on the price. They run about $1000+ So, I am looking for a trade in a full size, or may try another compact not real sure on that. The front strap is a colt removable insert if you don't like the make shift checkering.

Please email with any questions. *Please note* Texas residents must also pay state sales tax. The Henry Golden Boy is a masterpiece of fine crafted gunsmithing. Any shooting enthusiast who closely examines one is immediately impressed with the excellent fit, finish and overall visually elegant design. The Golden Boy rifle’s awesome 20-inch blued octagonal barrel, American walnut stock, brass buttplate and gleaming Brasslite receiver will transport you back to the wild and wooley days of America’s Old West, when Benjamin Tyler Henry designed the original Henry lever action rifle.      Small game hunters and plinkers will appreciate its substantial 6¾ pound heft. It balances well and makes for highly accurate offhand shooting. The smooth action associated with Henry rifles opens and shuts with the effortless slickness lever-lovers long for. Get one in your hands and take aim. See what a natural pointer it really is. Adding to the historic authenticity is the adjustable buckhorn-type rear sight. The .22 LR version holds 16 rounds. The .22 Mag and .17HMR hold 12 rounds. Both will provide a whole lot of shooting pleasure before it’s time to reload their tubular magazines.  The Henry Golden Boy rifle is one beautiful classic that’s affordably priced so you hombres won’t have to rob a stagecoach to own one. All we ask is that you mosey on down to your local gun shop and ask to see the Henry Golden Boy. You’ll definitely agree it’s the rifle that brings out the West in you. The youth version of our award winning Golden Boy has a shorter barrel and length of pull, this compact version is ideal for most youngsters or for the gals who may find it easier to handle. Comes with a brass barrel band."

This is a high end rifle build. I custom built this rifle, all of the parts I used where made in the United States by well known companies. I can't list everything, it's just way to much to list. The lower receiver is an Anderson Arms! It has a 3lb competition trigger that has a very smooth break and reset. It has a 20in Stainless Steel cold hammer forged barrel. It has M4 feed ramps and a full-auto M16 bolt carrier group. It has a Fortis ""Hammer"" Nickel Boron Charging Handle. I only put 30rds through the rifle to make sure that it was functioning well. This rifle is extremely accurate, it's a tac driver! It comes with a Konus Pro M30 6-25x50 scope that has a illuminated reticle. This scope is ridiculous, 25x zoom. Comes with a mag, bipod, Magpul MOE foregrip, and a Drago double rifle bag. I'm only selling my rifle because I'm going  to buy a newer car. I have $2,200 invested in the rifle, I have receipts. But, I will only take $1,600 for it which is a really good price. No trades. Please call or text at REDACTED, thanks and have a blessed day!"

Here are a few of the uppers specs..223 Wilde, it fires both 5.56 & 22316.5"" Spiral fluted green mountain, 1:8 heavy barrel with Hand lapped chamber..Carbon black & sniper gray, cerekote Side bolt.Clarke carbon fiber Forend.Nickel Boron Bolt Carrier Group.Aero Precision upper assembly.Super extended Swan rail with rear sight.Shrewd varmit muzzle brakeMega ambi charging handle.Nikon Scope.That's just a few things on this gun. I can send you the complete build sheet if your interested. Extremely accurate, especially with my hand loads. Company guarantees .50 MOA with their custom builds but this is actually quite a bit lower than that with my loads."

I have fired around 200 rounds through it and just from visual inspection the rifling on it is still strong on both ends. The rifle has been well maintained while I have owned it and every time I have taken it out shooting I have completely stripped it down and cleaned it. This SKS will come with several stripper clips (About 20 give or take), while most of them are in pretty good quality I haven't had the chance to actually test out each and every one of them so it may be a good idea to spend some time with some pliers in order to set them straight as some of the more wonkey ones have a tendency to shed rounds while loading them into the magazine.As this rifle does have the gas shut off valve I took it upon myself to change out the valve inside with a new stainless steel one and the old one with the spring will be included, Upon purchase I'll show you what I did and how to reverse it if you want to as right now it is more or less fixed in semi-automatic mode.Shoot me an email about any questions you  might have and I'll usually get back within a few hours."
