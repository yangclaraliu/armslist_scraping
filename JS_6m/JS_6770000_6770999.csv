I just recently found out it's a repro. Anyways, I purchased this rifle about 8 years ago only because I loved the look and had never seen a Mosin Nagant sniper rifle in Big 5. Again I loved the look not really thinking is it a true variant or repro. Well now I'm selling it for the price I paid only cause I'm looking for some extra cash for my daughters first car, other wise I'd keep it. I've only put maybe 50-60 rounds through it and it just sits in the gun cabinet. It's clean and in great condition for a 1923 dragoon. But I believe the bolt and scope mount are true sniper variant parts. Funny thing is bolt SN matches the rest of the rifle. I will throw in a Russian spam can with it (440 rds) You can contact me at REDACTED call or text."

If you're a scammer, please don't bother with the fake cashier's check for a larger amount than the asking price, it's a waste of time. If you absolutely insist on another form of payment (cashier's check, etc.), please be aware it can take up to approximately 3 weeks to fully clear the issuing bank. I will only ship after the bank has confirmed the money order or check has fully cleared. After I receive a copy of your dealer's FFL, shipping would be $50 insured to your FFL. Please note: if your FFL will not accept shipments from individuals, there will be an additional fee of $35 to have a local FFL do the shipping.Please feel free to contact me with any questions you might have and/or for more pictures. Thanks for looking!"

This revolver has been well maintained. Colt made the Anaconda between 1990 and 1999. This one isn't even broken in yet. I bought this approx 9 years ago from the original owner and he didn't put more than a couple dozen rounds through it. After I purchased it, I put about 12 rounds through it myself, cleaned/lubed it and put it in an environmentally controlled safe. It's been there ever since where it gets an occasional wipe down of CLP. . I've decided to downsize and don't really have a use for a .44 mag. This Colt is exceptionally clean and locks up nicely. No issues. I would rate this Colt a 9.5 out of 10. It has a couple very small light scratches/thin scuffs on the frame from the previous owner storing it unprotected in a rack in his safe. They are so light they probably weren't worth mentioning, but I like to give detailed descriptions. Includes the Colt blue hard case that is like new, owner's manual, black Colt factory rubber combat grips (made by Pachmayr) and the rare Colt factory wood grips in mint condition. These are the real deal Colt factory wood grips (made for the Colt Anaconda and other V frames during the 90's) and they are extremely tough to find. These grips cost around 300.00 when you can find them. I routinely sell on ebay and have over 1200 feedback ratings with a score of 100%.Please don't send me any low ball offers or trade deals. I'm not desperate to sell this Colt.Thanks for looking."

This example of Colt’s heavy duty snake gun was manufactured in 1991, or during the second year of production (offered between 1990 and 2003). This revolver is solid stainless steel with a soft luster finish. The revolver has a dual pinned, ramped front sight with HI-VIS orange insert and an adjustable white outline notch rear sight. It features light floral scroll engraving on both sides of the barrel near the muzzle and at the breech. Colt equipped this Anaconda with a serrated trigger and a wide serrated hammer and fitted it with checkered walnut grips with gold Colt 150th Anniversary medallions. Complete with blue plastic Colt factory hardcase, blue Colt factory box, hang tag and owner’s manual. The trigger actions on the Anacondas are rated as very high-quality, and the heavy-duty solid construction and weight tends to absorb recoil, making the Anaconda relatively easy to shoot with heavy loads We believe this Anaconda to be new. It is in Excellent condition with 99% of the original stainless steel finish with slight handling marks, some light handling scratches near the Rampant Colt and a light cylinder drag line. No powder rings at chamber faces or indications of firing at barrel breech or muzzle or around firing pin. The engravings and stampings are crisp and clear. The grips are excellent with sharp checkering. The case and box are excellent. Mechanically, this revolver is excellent."

As reported by Don Wilkerson, prolific author of authoritative books on Colt firearms, only 24 3rd Generation Single Action Army's were manufactured in the “full blue” configuration as a extremely limited run in 1982. This revolver is marked with the standard stampings of the Colt SAA but instead of combining polished bluing with color case hardening as the metal finish, Colt used the “royal blue” on every metal part except the hammer sides, which they polished to a bright, mirror finish. Included with the revolver is a Colt ""wood grain"" box with hand-marked matching label, owner’s manual, and papers. This rare Colt is “As New”, with original, full Colt-blue finish on frame, barrel, cylinder, trigger and trigger guard. The grips are excellent, with one tiny pressure dent on the left grip, on the oval surrounding the rampant Colt. The Colt, brown wood-grained box is good, showing wear appropriate for 33 year old cardboard box, mostly at the corners and edges, with surface scuffing top and bottom. The owner’s manual appears new. Mechanically untested in order to preserve the pristine cylinder condition. An exceptional Colt SAA “modern day” rarity."

I got it all set up and I have never even shot it. There has never been a single round through the rifle. It comes with the factory stock as well as the Boyd's thumbhole stock shown in the picture. The scope is a Vortex Crossfire 6-18x50 with Weaver tactical scope rings and the bipod is a 6"" Caldwell. I still have the original box I bought it in as well.

Has the blade type underfolding bayonet and grenade launcher brake and ladder sight attachment. What separates the Yugo is that it also has flip-up night sights for the front and rear that were standard issue. They obviously do not glow any longer but still neat. Rifle has adjustable gas system to convert over to grenade launching mode which switches the rifle to a single shot setting; never fired a grenade but the single shot is a bit of fun. Rifle was acquired from Classic designated as ""very good-excellent"" and has all number matching as part of a hand select option.I do have two of these rifles, the other being a little more blonde in color. Would be willing to potentially part with both given the right deal. Not really looking for trade unless it's a Sig P320 compact. Would be willing to add a few bucks to that. No shipping at this time, local only and all local laws apply. CC preferred, MN ID required."
