The same numerals are featured around the medallion logo in the center of the premium-wood grip panels.The pistol, magazines, cleaning rod, and safety lock are contained in an ammo-can-style Beretta box, which also sports the anniversary dates.The Original Beretta 1915Only a month after Italy entered the First World War on the side of the allies, Beretta patented the Model 1915, which was immediately adopted by the Italian military. Chambered in 9mm Glisenti, a rather mild counterpart of the 9mm Parabellum on which it was actually based, the Model 1915 single-action semiauto featured a cutaway on the slide and a minimally-protruding barrel—two features that would become a hallmark of Beretta pistols in years to come. Curiously, it also had two safety devices: one frame-mounted in the rear (similar to the one we have “copied” for the 92 Centennial), the other located above the trigger. The 92 Centennial tastefully imitates some of these features while also showcasing the very best of what Beretta has achieved in the intervening century."
87,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6093087,For Sale:  UTS-15 Tactical Shotgun WITH Integrated Light & Laser,"Sierra Vista, Tucson, Arizona","$ 1,200","Listed On: Wednesday, November 9, 2016",Shotguns,no type,12 Gauge                                                                                ,Pump Action                                                                                ,Shotgun,"Twin chamber fed UTAS-15 12 gauge pump shotgun that has only been fired ONCE (I've decided to keep my Saiga 12).  I have somewhat of an extensive collection and after having gone through them all (safe queens included), I've come to realize that I haven't fired half of my collection (hence why I was definitely going to go shoot that UTS-15 at least once).  I am thinning out my collection simply to make room, not for more firearms I just need the space.  This shotgun is, as you will notice if unfamiliar, NOT or typical 12 gauge.  It has 2 loading chambers that accept either 2 3/4 or 3' shells that are side by side, the barrel is nestled underneath inbetween the two.  The ejection post is that much like a ""bullpup"" design except that is where it ejects the shell as you rack a new one, out of the buttstock.  Due to this design, this makes this particular shotgun a PERFECT choice for home protection where CQB would be most likely to happen due to it's over all very short overall profile length.  A central selector switch is located on the top near the rear of the rail that allows you to select from which chamber/tube that you wish to feed from.  You can load 7 shells of double-ought buck in the right tube, and 7 shells of slugs in the left and select which do you wish to fire.  If you leave the selector switch in the middle position, the shotgun will alternate between the two tubes as each shot is fired.It is equipped with Magoul MBUS front and rear sights, and a True-Glo red/green dot.  You really need nothing else added to this shotgun.  The FACTORY UTS (not a knockoff) integrated light & laser that in most instances DO NOT come with the shotgun once bought new, but can be ordered and installed has NEVER BEEN INSTALLED and is still brand new in its plastic/foam inserted UTS case ($300.00 alone for that accessory).  NO DRILLING/MODIFICATIONS required.  UTAS developed this shotgun with the light/laser system in mind and the tooling is already complete when you buy one should you then choose to add the light/laser.  I paid brand new $1299.00 for this shotgun, and $299.00 for the integrated light/laser (that the wiring is fed down the pump tube and connects to a selector switch that can easily be activated by your right index finger naturally from the rest position outside of the trigger gaurd).  So all in all this was a $1600 shotgun that has been fired only ONCE.  Not a SINGLE SCRATCH on her.  PLEASE NOTE:  This is a ""package deal"" in that the light/laser that has yet to be installed (which could be done in under 20 minutes) IS MADE FOR THIS GUN AND THIS GUN ONLY.  I couldn't use it on ANTHING ELSE.  I am already eating over $400 from what I have into it, so essentially you are getting it for free anyways.  Thanks. Both my Springfield XDM 5.25 Match .45 ACP and S&W M&P 15 AR have sold.  I accurately represent what I sell and consider myself very much a part of our Southern AZ gun culture.  November 5th my AR sold to a gentleman who drove down from Scottsdale to purchase.  November 6th I received the following text message from him:""Dude I took it out today and it was awesome!  I'm in on your Glock-17, and my bro wants one too.  I trust you so whatever you think is a good conditioned G-17 we will buy it.  Oh and bro what was the name of that Magpul stock?""I have yet not decided (and most likely won't) whether or not I plan to let my Glock 17 go.  If I don't, I will get him and his bro both into one, just not mine as of right now that is not on the chopping block.Thank you for any interest."

Originally known as the K-38 Combat Masterpiece, it was renamed the Model 15 in 1957 when all Smith & Wesson revolvers were given numerical model numbers. It is a shorter barrel version of the Smith & Wesson Model 14 Target Masterpiece and essentially an adjustable-sight version of the seminal Smith & Wesson Model 10 (""Military and Police"") revolver with target shooting features. The main production run of the Model 15 was from 1949 through 1999. It was discontinued for approximately a decade until 2011, when a re-tooled version was re-released under S&W's Classics Revolvers line. This gun is used with some pitting on the right side.

I have a very early model DPMS A-15 serial number 1,1xx. This is completely original and looks to be fired less than 50 rounds or so.  The hammer, shell deflector, dust cover and other ""moving pieces"" show very little wear.  The rifle has a cast aluminum receiver which was common on the early models (similar to Colt's of this era). The rifle has the ""trap door"" A2 stock.  This thing was brought home and put in the safe for almost 30 years! No kidding! I contacted DPMS to get an exact date of manufacture and was told it was ""too low of a serial number"" for DPMS to date it. However according to DPMS the cutoff for the serial numbers for pre ban (produced prior to the AW ban in 1994) is ser # 10,300, mine is 1,1xx.  
I have taken the rifle into a local gun store (not a ""big box"" store) and had them evaluate the rifle. They rate the rifle in the 95% for condition and said the rifle would fetch $1,700 to $1,800 dollars as it sits. Everyone I've showed the rifle to is surprised and say they have ""never seen"" a DPMS with that low of a serial number.  Currently there is a similar DPMS lower receiver with no stock or original handgrip with a serial number 8,0xx listed on GunBroker with a current bid of $980.00.  Please note this is the lower receiver and internals ONLY and about 7,000 units higher than mine. 
If you want to own a very early DPMS pre-ban collector piece here is your chance. I am asking $1500 cash. Will consider trades but don't want junk. Multi gun trades ok too. Don't bother low balling I know what I have and already am offering a fair price. I can send more detailed pictures if you want. 
Thank you."

Bought it 3 years ago so all three of my kids could have a large caliber rifle to hunt deer and pig with, but at the same time I could easily adjust the stock shorter for my younger 2 and longer for my oldest, while shooting a larger round they felt very little if any recoil, adjustable trigger so they had no trouble pulling the trigger, and it worked well on a bipod hunting from our box stands. All three of my kids took a few deer. And really enjoyed the rifle. But they have all gotten older and now have their own .243 for the younger 2 and my oldest has a 7mm-08. Anyway about the rifle specifically I have a trigger I put in it (because when I first got it the standard AR trigger was not easy for their little fingers.) it ran me 350$ but it is awesome. It's set I believe right now at around 1.5lbs. I will try to get pics up a little later. I am asking 1,100$ obo. But not really wanting to sell. Would rather trade it for something hunting. I am not one of these people that gets hung up on ""trade value"" so offer it I have traded down and up (mostly down most people are very specific on ""trade value"" a couple hundred bucks. But that also doesn't mean that I'm willing to take anything. If it's something that I'm not that interested in but willing to trade I consider trade value more so than if I'm offered something I have been wanting for a while or something I've never seen or considered. You never know. But like I said mostly looking for hunting firearms, rifles, shotguns and such but will consider pistols and revolvers as well. You can contact me on here but sometimes I'm not on for a day or two so feel free to call/text 803-507-4759 for any questions or pics. Gonna try to get pics up again later today.

Most accurate gun I've ever shot, can easily drive tacks at 250+yards. Taken deer with it as well, so would make a great gun for a youth or as a coyote gun. Looking to sell but I won't let it go for nothing because I know that this is worth a pretty penny. Has a shorter stock but I am 5'9"" and can very comfortably shoot no problem. Email me with any questions or for more pictures."
