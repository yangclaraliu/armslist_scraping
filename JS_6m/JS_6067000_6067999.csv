The lighting in these pictures doesn't accurately depict the colors. For those of you that are getting beat to death by all the ""tacticool"" stuff flooding the firearm industry, this is for you. I had a big idea that I wanted ""the one"" shotgun. Home defense, land clearing, hunting, etc. all out of one scattergun (or two...one for a backup). But...I wanted to keep the wood. So, I grabbed up two of the most reliable shotguns on the planet (Rem 870) for my base guns and got to it. There is a lot of hype in the tactical world geared towards making folks spend money on stuff they think will improve their shooting, gun, or personality.  Now I'm no kooky old purist, but I do believe a pistol grip on your scattergun is one of these things and is only advantageous when breaching doors. The plain-Jane ol' riffle stock is much faster on the swing and better all around so it was retained. I also opted for a fully rifled barrel. It filled ""the one"" role a little better than the traditional smooth bore. It's accurate out to pretty much as far as you can see with sabot rounds and for home defense it spreads 00 and high velocity turkey rounds out nice enough to ruin anyone's month.  It takes 2 3/4"" & 3"" shells. All of the modifications have been professionally carried out and only improve the function of the 870, no fluff here. Pretty simple and reliable build. The stock was re-worked first:Its LOP has been shortend by about 1.5"". Then it was hand worked by a local woodworker to look like it should. With the added benefit of smoothing it and the forend out and taking down any stock sharp edges that Rem left behind. Then, it and the forend were both stripped, blended again, and stained antique gray. The Internals:The internals were all cleaned, deburred, and polished up.  The mag follower is stock, but was also deburred and rounded so it moves smoothly with no hang ups. Exterior of Shotgun and Interior Receiver:The whole exterior of the shotgun, as-well-as, the interior of the receiver has been coated with KG-2400 Executive Gray colored coating. It also aids in lubricity because the coating is self lunricating. So, it requires much less oil and is easier to clean.  The whole shotgun is weatherproof at this point. Misc:A +3 mag extension and clamp were added. Also, a Blackhawk! receiver mounted single point sling point was installed.  It can be used single or double with a sling point up on the mag extension clamp if you so desire. I'm selling it because I built two. My ""one is none and two is one"" mentality took over, but in reality I only really need one of them. So, this one has only been test fired and sat in a gun safe for two years. It really has only been test fired. For all intents and purposes it is brand new. I invite anyone to strip it down and verify. Im asking $375. I'd be willing to travel a bit, but I'm not driving 3hrs away. Again, please text me at 614-four77-8four5three if you're interested. If you email me you may or may not get a response. Thank you."

It’s the ultimate refinement of the time-tested AR-15 design and represents everything that a defensive carbine should be.   The quality of a rifle begins with its foundation. That’s why the extra-tough Type III aircraft-grade 7075 T6 aluminum upper and lower receivers are joined using the Accu-Tite system. Unlike lesser rifles, the SAINT™ is rock solid, with no accuracy-killing rattle or shake. On the outside, a hard-anodizing treatment protects your SAINT™ from both corrosion and the dings and blemishes that accompany hard use. Inside the upper receiver is an M16 bolt carrier group machined from Carpenter 158 steel. It’s shot peened and magnetic particle inspected for long-term durability. The SAINT™ features a 16-inch Chrome Moly Vanadium barrel treated with Melonite. Because details matter, you’ll even find that hidden areas like under the front sight base are finished with painstaking care and detail. The 1:8-inch twist rate provides the user with complete ammunition flexibility – the SAINT will handle heavy 80-grain and ultra-light projectiles with equal aplomb. While receiver fit and barrel construction represent the foundation of accurate performance, the trigger is the final interface between the shooter and rifle. The SAINT™ features micro-polished trigger components treated with Nickel Boron. The result is the feel of a competition trigger with the appropriate mil-spec pull weight for a defensive rifle. The SAINT is easy to shoot to its full performance potential. Speaking of performance, the SAINT™ is designed for smooth operation and fast but controlled follow-up shots. The mid-length gas system paired with a heavier carbine “H” heavy Tungsten buffer slows and smooths out the recoil cycle, creating a shooting experience second to none. Unlike most AR-type rifles that leave the factory with standard mil-spec furniture, the SAINT™ includes meaningful upgrades across the board. The Bravo Company Mod 0 Pistol Grip offers a more vertical orientation designed to support a natural hold when shooting from the modern combat stance. The grip is complemented by a Bravo oversized trigger guard designed for easy reach, with or without gloves. The Bravo Company buttstock offers positive cheek weld areas, a rubber butt plate for traction, and both QD and fixed sling attachment points. Like the Accu-Tite receiver, it’s designed for tight, rattle-free operation in any of its six positions. The all new and exclusive Bravo PKMT two-piece handguard covers aluminum heat shields but offers a super-slim profile. KeyMod attachment points allow placement of accessories according to your personal preference. In short, you’ll feel the difference. A defensive rifle must also be reliable, and that’s why the SAINT™ uses a dry lubricant coating inside the bolt carrier group and receiver extension tube that keeps it performing in the worst of conditions. The SAINT™ is optics-ready out of the box. The flat-top receiver is topped with Springfield Armory® low profile flip-up dual aperture rear sight with ½ minute of angle windage adjustment capability. Up front, the A2-style gas block and front sight features a standard post adjustable for elevation. The bottom line? When it’s time to protect and defend, trust the SAINT™.

This was built to be my go to rifle for fun and to fire suppressed but my situation has changed so I am looking to see if anyone is interested. Rifle has roughly 30 rounds through to test cycling and sight in with scope. Barrel is 1:8 rifling under a free float M-lok hand guard with a pistol length gas system for consistent cycling of subsonic rounds. Trigger was upgraded to an ALG combat trigger with reduced strength spring for a very smooth 4 1/2 lb trigger pull. Can change to mill spec spring if preferred or will include if you want to change later. Has a POF anti-tilt mill spec buffer tube and attached to that is Fab Defense GL Mag adjustable stock which hides an extra hidden 10 round magazine. The stock will actually hold an extra 30 round but looks really awkward and extremely heavy(especially with 220 grain subs). BCM ambidextrous charging handle as well as a BCM QD end plate with push button sling mount. Picatinny fore grip attached with M-Lok rail piece. New Vortex crossfire 2 scope 4x16x50 AO with 4"" sunshade included with a Vortex 3"" offset cantilever mount.

Make offer.Frangible short-range ball. 28 grains that consist of approximately 80% copper and 20% plastic.Sounds like the lead-free primers is what made it attractive for indoor use. No longer imported to US.It's HOT Hirtenberger ammo for indoor shooting/shoot houses. Will zip through targets, but will disintegrate when hitting steel targets and cement board (as opposed to drywall). It should cycle in all ARs. If it doesn't, it's because the system is OVER gassed.

It's in 100% pristine condition, having never been used,carried or sharpened, and comes with the original box and packaging. This model was personally designed by Spyderco founder,owner and CEO, Sal Glesser.  It's a full-sized, open pillar, spine-lock folder, with steel reinforced, FRN (fiberglass reinforced nylon) scales, and multi-position pocket clip. The blade is VG-10, a very high quality Japanese stainless steel, that holds an edge very well, is highly corrosion resistant, but is much easier to re-sharpen than some other popular super-steels like S30V, ZDP189,etc.VG10 is also used in the popular, top quality knives like the Falkniven Swedish pilots survival knives, as well as several more of Spydercos most popular knives, also made in Seki City,Japan, like the Delica,Endura,Dragonfly,etc. This early model of the Stretch has been discontinued and is now harder to find, except on Ebay, where prices run around $120+. Asking $70 cash/trade value.Thanks for looking.........And......IF THE AD IS STILL UP, THEN I STILL HAVE THE KNIFE. No shipping.

 This wheel-gun is a real shooters delight. Has a Smooth double and single action that S&W is known for. The K/L medium frame is good for most shooters hands. The Heavy 6in stainless barrel is EXTREMLY accurate, and makes a .38 kick like a .22! Very manageable recoil with those .357 magnums too! Great for moose, coyote, or bear protection on those wilderness backpacking trips! Weapon dates from 2012, and is in good condition, with normal wear and fine scratches.
***NOTE: THIS IS THE 6 SHOT MODEL, not the 686-Plus, don’t ask!
***NOTE: While the Box is original, the padding inside the hard case is NOT. The previous owner managed to destroy the padding somehow, so I created a custom fitted blue Felt Pad for the case. It looks nice and protects the revolver well!

$550 in cash.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? this makes it a lot easier when considering.Mostly interested in semi-autos(AR's AK's), but will consider others, trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles, depending on value as I can build nice ones pretty cheap right now.
Folding brace and nice trigger/parts to fit a Sig P556.
Springfield M1A SOCOM 16 or Scout 18"".
AR style pistol in 9mm or 5.56, looking for one without buffer tube like the Sig, but will consider others too.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus, AR15 and AR10's, AK type with 10"" barrel and folding brace, Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" model only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal, depending on value.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles.  Value needs to equal cash price, let me know the details.
Vortex Strike Eagle 1-6x, PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308, other similar 1-6x and 1-4x with nice clear glass, true 1x magnification, QD mounts are a plus, not interested in retail prices, I can buy online any time.Must be legal to own a firearm in TX."
