A long recoil spring is located in the butt of the stock, simplifying assembly and allowing it to cycle a wide variety of loads across the power spectrum in both 2 ¾” and 3”.
In addition, the rearward spring design makes required cleanings less frequent and easier when they are needed. Removal of the installed magazine plug is simple, requiring only the magazine cap to be unscrewed.  With superb balance and an average weight of 7.4 lbs, the 912 is well-suited to the pursuit of both birds and clays.Excellent condition,with 5 choke tubes & Shell catcher."

The technology is designed to transfer 100% of the 150 grain bullet’s energy into the target, providing maximum stopping power as quickly as possible. Keeping the bullet weight to 150 grains yields comparatively lighter felt recoil and therefore faster and more accurate follow up shots. Another benefit for high round count shooters is less wear on your weapon. The bottom line is that you simply don't need heavy bullets to cause extreme tissue damage to the intended target. The 45 bullet is designed to penetrate 9-11” in ballistic gelatin and to have a wound cavity of up to 3” in diameter. It will penetrate soft barriers like sheet rock, plywood, car doors, and windshields. Background check and Transfer to be paid by buyer at Dave's Sportshop in Lynden."

No scratches or any issues with the condition of it. The only thing I did with it was break in the 2 magazines that came with it, and even then they probably aren't fully broken in. As I said earlier, the only reason I am looking to sell it is because I have no time for it. Let alone I don't even use it to carry which is what I do with the other two pistols I own. Call it ""firearm neglect"" if you will. I am hoping someone is interested in it so they will be able to enjoy it like I was not able to. I purchased it for a little over $600 brand new. I still have the receipts, and the original box as well if interested. It comes with two mags as well as 50 rounds of Remington .45 UMC.

This is not an AK in any way for those who aren't familiar. This is the Czech military rifle and is built with real Czech Small Arms military parts by them in Czech and imported by Czechpoint. This is not one of the Century abominations, this is a high quality, well made and ultra reliable rifle made by the same factory that makes the Czech military rifles. Operates on a short stroke gas piston action and features a chrome lined barrel and chamber. This means a few things, it operates cleaner and cooler because no hot gas goes into the receiver, it is inherently very accurate because the short stroke piston and tight tolerances and also has VERY light recoil, like 1/5th of an AK. Receiver and bolt are fully milled. I had the custom duracoat camouflage finish applied immediately after purchasing and it has not been fired since. Gun is like new condition and comes with 9 total mags that are duracoated to match, 8 of which are in the leather carry pouches.  I am offering it for $1000 or best offer and I will not seperate the gun and mags.  Contact me via email at REDACTED or via text at 502-526-two two two eight."

Selling my Bullseye and Steal Plate champion gun... This is a hard one to let go. Built it up when I was stationed in the Northeast and my buddies were into this type of shooting. Now I'm starting to shoot a lot of three gun and get back into hunting. So I need to sell this baby to make room for my new interests. I'm active military and take good care of all my weapons. This gun has been well cared for and well cleaned. There are some wear marks, but as the pictures show she still looks almost new. Prolly 1K rounds through her. Modifications: Hogue Wraparound gripsGunsmith installed Volquartsen Accuraizing kitTarget Hammer, Target Sear, Target Trigger in stainless steel, Extended Bolt Release, new Trigger Return Spring, Polished the Plunger, and Trigger now has adjustable pretravel and overtravel screws. All of that means that the trigger now has zero pre travel and breaks like glass at 2.5 lbs of pressure. Extra 10 round magazine (three instead of the factory 2).Pictures show the oversized Bolt Release (really makes a difference!) Also the gun will now fire with the magazine in or out. Magazine also falls free of the gun when released. I love this gun. I shot it with a Red Dot and also open sites. The barrel is tapped for the included scope/red dot mount. I have all the original parts (trigger assembly, springs, sear, cherry grips, site mount rail, swapable 3 red and 3 green fiber optic front site rods).Comes with all original paperwork including the factory fired bullet, trigger lock, hard plastic case,  and Ruger owners manual. I've sunk around $1200 into this gun. I'm sad to let it go, but I'm looking to start hunting again and need to purchase a rifle. I've priced it to sell quick. Please don't contact me unless you are seriously interested. I'm willing to ship, but buyer pays all FFL and shipping fees to be determined at the time of sale.Sale will be done through PayPal."
