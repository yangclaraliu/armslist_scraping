It's a great gun and shoots well. I thought I would have more opportunities to use it on my property when I purchased it, but have only put 12 rounds through it at a target. It's a smooth gun, in good condition, with no issues. I'm looking to replace it with more of a bush gun, that will handle trucking through the brush and trees that I have on my land. I've owned the gun for 3 years, I know personally both previous owners. The original ""new"" out of box cost was over $2000, I purchased it for $1200 3 years ago. It includes a laser bore-sight, and cleaning snake, with extra magazine."

First designed primarily for tactical undercover work, the Cougar is now carried by a growing number of police officers as their official duty sidearm thanks to its ergonomics, low recoil and inherent accuracy. The original Beretta Cougar was NATO qualified and boasted a long service-life of more than 30,000 9mm rounds. In its new incarnation, Beretta has developed an ergonomically-advanced pistol that is compact but capable of handling high-power cartridges, offering high magazine capacity and giving a long service life. This has been possible also thanks to the innovative adaptation of a locked-breech system with a rotating barrel. Today, the new Stoeger 8000 Cougar pistol is manufactured by the Stoeger Silah Sanayi A.S., strictly in line with the most traditional Beretta quality control and attention to detail. Low Recoil Upon firing this pistol, shooters are amazed by the low felt recoil. This is due to two factors working together. The first is the rotating barrel system, which dissipates recoil radially rather than directing it into the shooter’s hand. The second is the central block, which absorbs the mechanical recoil from the barrel and the slide before this is transferred to the frame. When the Cougar is in battery, the positive lock-up of barrel to slide assures perfect alignment of barrel and sights. Upon firing, the barrel travels and rotates with axial movement. Besides low recoil, the result is superior accuracy and quicker recovery for follow-up shots. Advanced Ergonomics for Easy Handling, Control, Concealment The Cougar is one of the most ergonomically advanced pistols in its class. The user-friendly, contoured frame and grips make the Cougar exceptionally easy to control during firing. By taking hand anatomy and instinctive hold into account, the Cougar accommodates smaller hands and also protects larger hands from being bitten by the slide. All edges are rounded or beveled, and are carefully finished to make the Cougar virtually snag-proof and exceptionally easy to draw and conceal. Different Configurations to Suit Most Tactical Needs The Cougar L Type P is conceived to deliver high firepower in F or D (Double Action Only) operating systems. F models have the same safety features of the famous Beretta 92 FS pistol: external ambidextrous manual safety with decocking lever, trigger bar disconnect, rotating firing pin striker, firing pin block device and loaded-chamber indicator. The double-action-only D versions have the firing pin block device and the loaded-chamber indicator but no manual safety, thereby offering a super-smooth, exceptionally snag-free side. Both versions are manufactured in 9 mm or .40 caliber to satisfy the different needs of police officers and concealed-carry permit holders.The 8000 Cougar L 9mm pistol, available in F or D configurations, features the same rotating barrel system of the full-size Cougar L Type P; the difference is in the shortened grip frame that houses a 13-round, high-capacity double-stack magazine. The beveled slide and the reduced dimensions and weight also make this model ideal for undercover work.

I have the box, original lancer mag, papers, etc.
This gun has not been shot. Factory grease was removed and gun was oiled.
This model is pretty rare and isn't to be confused with the Swat, Patrol, or classic 556 models.
This model has a match grade trigger, bull barrel with target crown, and no iron sights.
Really looking for cash right now unless you have a .338 Lapua you are looking to get rid of.
Thanks in advance. Quickest reponse will be through text but emails will be quick too.

This package is worth over $7000 if you wanted to replicate it today. It comes with ALL accessories seen in the photos, including the Pelican 1750 Tan Case.This is a custom built 300 Winchester Magnum Precision rifle, built around the proven Remington 700 Long Action. It was constructed using the best components available to guarantee the most accurate platform, possible of 1/2-3/4 MOA accuracy out to and beyond 1000m. This rifle has only 140 rounds through it and has proven to be a well under 3/4 MOA rifle with various types of commercially available match grade ammunition. The base rifle was a Remington 700 Sendero SF II in 300 Win Mag.. The rifle was test fired out of the box and was already a 1MOA rifle. The barreled action and bolt were kept and removed from the factory stock. The 1:10 twist, stainless steel fluted barrel was cut from 26” down to 24” and given a perfectly concentric 11 degree target crown while also being turned down for the installation of the Surefire MB762SSAL/RE muzzle brake. A Timney 510 Wide Bow Trigger with safety was installed (can be adjusted by user from 1.5-4.5 lbs) for a true glass-like break and combat toughness and reliability. The factory bolt was polished as were the action raceways for ultra smooth cycling. A Badger Tactical knob was installed for positive grip and leverage when shooting under stress. The action was topped with a 20 MOA Badger steel scope base which was properly bedded to the receiver (a step often overlooked on many builds). Barreled action was mated to a custom ordered Manners MCS T4A DBM stock. This stock has an imbedded aluminum Badger Mini Chassis to which the Badger detachable magazine bottom metal (fits Accuracy international mags) and barreled action mate. This squeezes the most possible accuracy out of the rifle.. Stock also has an adjustable check piece, dual forend sling studs, single rear sling stud, QD flush cups installed on left side (opposite side from bolt knob for comfortable carry). Stock has a pronounced toe for hooking support hand and rear bag, as well as a very comfortable 1” recoil pad. A PIGSKIN barricade pad is installed on the forend for positive grip when shooting from barricades. Rifle is topped with a Vortex Razor HD 5-20x50 FFP scope with EBR-2B illuminated reticle. This is a Mil/Mil optic with 1/10 MIL adjustments. 11 illumination settings work in any lighting conditions and the lowest settings are compatible with night vision devices. Scope is mounted in Precision machined and matched Vortex 35mm rings. Scope comes with 4 inch sunshade, Tenebraex ARD, and additional custom low light polarized lens which fits in scope cap to allow a clear view through window reflections and glare. A custom switch view lever was machined and installed for rapid magnification adjustment. Scope assembly includes Flatline Ops articulating scope level with attached Flatline Ops angle cosine indicator on Flatline Ops strong arms cosine mount. THIS SCOPE IS COVERED BY A LIFETIME, NO QUESTIONS ASKED, WARRANTY AS ARE ALL VORTEX PRODUCTS (best warranty in the industry in my opinion, which is why I chose Vortex for this and many of my builds). These modifications and upgrades took this rifle to its full potential. It is now capable of ½ MOA groups if the shooter does their part. Rifle components make it capable of very heavy use and harsh conditions or as a pampered bench rifle. The Barreled Action, Scope, and bipod have a heat cured cerakote base coat for ultimate durability. The entire rifle wears a custom multi color duracoat camouflage paint job designed to blend into most terrain settings, including browns, tans, greens, and geometric patterns to trick the eye. All accessories also have this same duracoat finish. In addition to the items listed above, this rifle package includes the following items/accessories:• Harris 9-13” HBLMS bipod with Phoenix tactical leg lock screws and KMW Pod Loc• (2) 5 round Accuracy International magazines• (1) 10 round Accuracy International magazine• Triad tactical 2 magazine pouch, FDE• Triad tactical large stock pack, FDE• TAB GEAR Elite Biathlon Sling with cobra buckles and QD hardware, FDE• Triad tactical Ammunition pouch with DOPE card window pockets • Accushot BT13-QK-PRM monopod• TAB GEAR Suppressor cover (9.5”L x 1.5”Diameter)• Pelican 1750 case with foam cut to accommodate rifle and all accessories • Mesh camouflage sniper/rifle veil• OTIS Precision rifle cleaning kit in zippered field pouch• Vortex optics/lens cleaning kit• Lens pen• Tiffen low light polarizer• Extra lithium optic batteriesPlease let me know if you have any additional questions or for additional photos.PLEASE- NO TRADE OFFERS"

The gun comes with one 10 round magazine.  Gun is in good condition 8/10The Beretta 92 FS semi-automatic pistol operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, leading to faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy, and greater reliability. The chrome-lined barrel provides extreme corrosion resistance and ease of cleaning, and the deeply-recessed combat muzzle crown protects the rifling. Its open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping and allows one cartridge at a time to be loaded should the magazine be lost or damaged. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table or door. The 92 FS pistol is the most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history, and this model is made in USA"

It was manufactured Dec of 2015 and I personally have no more than 300 rounds on it. Selling to fund my reloading ventures. Here's the deal on this optic, I bought it second hand, the first owner tried to install one of those hood covers and ended up stripping one of the Torx screws out, he then drilled out the screw but never tapped the hole it to reinstall the screw. The cover is still very secure and the optics performance is not hindered by this whatsoever. The screw needed IS included. You'd just thread the hole and reinstall the screw, I just never got around to doing it. Let me know if you have any questions. Letting it go for $390. Will ship. If you want it insured add $10.
