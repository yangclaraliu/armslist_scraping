Description:  The Omni Hybrid MAXX AR-15 features ATI's metal-reinforced polymer upper and lower receivers, which help to reduce weight and increase maneuverability without sacrificing durability! The lower receiver features an over-molded metal insert, which reinforces the buffer tube housing and rear takedown pin. This allows for metal-on-metal contact with both the buffer tube as well as the rear takedown pin, delivering the strength and durability to withstand recoil and constant use. INCREDIBLY TOUGH. In fact, the Omni Hybrid lower has been specifically tested to withstand all sorts of use and abuse. The folks at ATI put it through all the pressure and weight-bearing tests, similar to the US Military's testing, and found it to function flawlessly, even after supporting up to 250 lbs. and being run over by an 800-lb. forklift. Then, they ran 2,000 rounds through it without a hiccup. Both the upper and lower are built from a fiberglass-composite polymer over a zinc metal insert, with extra reinforcements in high-pressure sections Inter-lock hammer and trigger pin retainment system built into the Lower prevents movement from the hammer and trigger pin during firing 16"" M4 phosphated 4140 steel barrel with A2 flash hider Mil-spec sized M4 buttstock and buffer tube Low-profile gas block Standard charging handle A2 handguard Includes one 30-rd. polymer magazine KEY SPECIFICATIONS Item number: 672651 Caliber: 5.56 NATO / .223 Remington Action: Semi-automatic Capacity: 30+1 Barrel length: 16"" Barrel style: M4-profile, phosphate-coated Barrel twist: 1:8"" Stock: M4 adjustable Upper receiver: Metal-reinforced polymer Lower receiver: Metal-reinforced polymer Sights (front / rear): Optics-ready Handguard: A2 Flash hider: A2 Weighs approx. 5.5 lbs.

Police officers actually shot their pistols very little, normally once a year on the range to qualify, such as this piece shows. There are very few of this model for sale, most people choose to keep nice pieces like this. I however have started a thinning process, most know what I mean. The price of $500.00, is firm."

Purchased a few months ago thinking would be doing a large fence project only to change course. Used for 2 post holes. Had serviced right after I bought through the Home Depot to change oil and check out. Auger bit is in excellent condition as is machine. The part where the throttle cable goes into twist handle is cracked but does not affect use. Great price for a great setup. This setup rents for close to a $100 a day at HD or in the neighborhood of $300 a week I believe. Asking $375 Cash.....would consider trade.2.  Bayou Classic 4 Gallon Propane Fryer. Used but nice Bayou Classic 4 gallon propane deep fryer model 700-701. This is a stainless fryer and is a very nice fryer for large fry gatherings. Has the original stainless legs and also comes with the after market stainless cart model 700-185, the two original small baskets and the XL single basket model 700-188. Works great, heats quick and holds heat well. I used probably half dozen times with no problem and when I dumped and cleaned grease it's just been sitting as we don't do large enough gatherings to warrant using this. Look it all up online. This is a minimum $400 setup new. Asking $325 Cash or consider trade.  NO propane tank!Would consider trades for multiple different firearms of close to equal values of either.  Trade value a minimum of asking cash price and a little higher, would entertain reasonable offers.  Email or text preferred.  318-268-two four three five.  Thanks"

I suspect it will be hard to find another cold-hammer forged barrel in 300 Blackout unless it is from one of the very few manufactures that can cold hammer forge.  This barrel will last a lifetime.  I found out I love the 300 Blk out caliber but am not a hunter so I decided to get an SBR and shorter barrel.  After 8 months my SBR came through so I really don't need this barrel.  This would make for an excellent deer rifle on top of your AR lower.  I will throw in the TRUGLOW red dot for an extra $50, which I had on the rifle.It was a complete upper assembly by PSA.  They always fire and check headspace.  No BCG.  It is pistol gas , 1/8 twist and MP tested."
