I also have several listed as I am thinning out my collection some. Look at my listings. ThanksI will trade towards multiple cheaper guns, gun plus cash from you, gun plus cash from me, gun for gun, or whatever seems fair to the both of us.I am only trading for pistols, no long guns at all. I am specifically looking for the following.1) Gold coins at 95 % spot price2) Colt Snake guns Python , Anaconda , Cobra , King Cobra , BOA , Diamondback , Viper3) Colt guns ( I do like older ones)4) Nice revolver guns5) Nice 1911 guns 6) kimber k6 3577) Performance Center Guns8) Pre-lock Smith and Wesson revolvers9) Will accept ammo if still in the original box and at a really good deal. I can order ammo by the cases and get good deals so this is basically to even out trades or for bulk ammo at a good discount in case you have some calibers you don't need anymore. (mostly pistol ammo but will accept others possibly)Face to face transaction, I must see your concealed carry permit or get your pistol purchase permit. I will provide the same. If you do need to use a credit card, I do have an app that we can use but it costs 3% extra, and if anything goes through ffl, it is at your expense. I'm willing to help anyway I can on my end.

In USPSA Production Division, CZ pistols are now used by twice as many top-level competitors than any other maker. Given that popularity, it was high time to up the ante. Starting from scratch, CZUB engineers took the best features of the original Shadow and improved upon them. More than two years later, we’re seeing the fruits of their efforts. With a higher beavertail and undercut trigger guard, the shooter’s hand is able to be as close to the bore axis as possible. With a contoured slide, the majority of the reciprocating mass is also centered on the bore, equating to less muzzle flip. Increased weight at the dust cover/rail also helps keep the muzzle down. The Shadow 2’s swappable mag release has an adjustable, extended button with three settings to allow shooters to set it in the spot most comfortable for them. Best of all, new trigger components give smooth DA and crisp, clean SA while drastically reducing trigger reset. A hardy nitride finish coats the entire pistol, leaving it nearly impervious to corrosion. Thin blue (or Black) aluminum grips have healthy checkering to match the fine front and backstrap checkering of the pistol itself. Sitting atop the slide are a set of target sights — fiber optic on front and a serrated, black HAJO rear (click adjustable for elevation, drift adjustable for windage).CZ MFG#91254 CLICK HERE TO PURCHASE THE CZ SHADOW 2 >>>"

Serial number on the gun dates it to around 2003. I am the original owner. Around 700 rounds through it. It sits in a nice moisture controlled environment. Recent Sig factory service last year replaced some of the springs such as the mag release and trigger spring. The feed ramp was also polished and 3 dot Night Sights were installed. Three factory 8 round Sig magazines come with it as does the original box with the holster that came with the sale. As I mentioned earlier, this one was made in West Germany and it states that on the slide, so that dates the gun somewhat. Newer ones just say ""Germany"". This is a safe queen and doesn't get much work with all the other stuff I have. I don't need to sell it, so low ball offers will not receive a response. Nice condition, very little wear and was never carried in a holster. Transaction must be at an FFL, as I am out of Form 10's for the online portal. All laws will be followed.
