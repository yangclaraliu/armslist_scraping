It has adjustable white dot sights, top slide serrations, a built in rail for a laser or flashlight and the safety is on the frame. There is a small rub mark on the lower grip of the frame because I was shooting it while wearing my wedding ring. It's nothing bad and the gun looks excellent. I bought it new for $650.00 but will sell it for $475.00 . I am willing to ship it to your local FFL dealer. I live in West Houston Texas and local pick up is okay too. Customer pays for shipping and 3% for Paypal. Shipping shouldn't that cost much. I do have more pictures if you send me your email address. The only reason why I am selling this is because I need money to put towards a new milling machine for my shop. Thank you."

It's one of several thousand pistols ordered by the Israeli Mossad and later imported into the U.S. It has an 8 round magazine, a threaded barrel, and a mock suppressor (which has already been removed for you). These pistols have a lot of interesting history, and this one is in great shape! THIS IS NOT AN NFA ITEM. In order to import these pistols into the United States, they had to meet certain size/weight requirements so a nonfunctional suppressor was ""permanently"" pinned and welded onto the barrel. I've since removed it, which makes the pistol much more usable(the suppressor blocks the sight picture and makes it uncomfortably front heavy), however you can still easily thread it back on/off if you'd like. It doesnt make the pistol any quieter and thus isn't a true suppressor or regulated by the NFA.DO NOT MESSAGE ME ASKING IF IT'S STILL AVAILABLE. If the listing is up- it is still for sale. I will remove it once sold."
