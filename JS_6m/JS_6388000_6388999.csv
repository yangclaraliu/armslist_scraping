It will only be sold after the binoculars have been sold or with the binoculars.I have many photos I can e-mail to you if interested. I will try to have the photos uploaded but that may take a couple of days for me to figure out how to do it.The buyer of these binoculars will be delighted with their condition and performance. They're indistinguishable from brand new.Thanks!"

I have 2 for trade currently...Anyway, back to the AR-15's, they are the most simplistic, diverse, effecient, durable weapon on this planet and, please don't let anyone tell you that custom builds are not as good as a box gun. They are and better if built correctly by someone who knows what they are doing! I have several different profiles to choose from and I trade !!!! yes, I trade...see below for some of the things I like :-)So, let me know what you have to offer in trade and what type of AR you are interested in and we'll go from there:-) My name is Joe and you can reach me at 417 886 zero, zero six 4 ... by phone, text or email through this site or at jpulleyy at aol dot com.Have a blessed day..."

The unit works great, again in more info pipe tobacco then I am cigars. I paid over $500 for the unit, but this one doesn't come empty. Inside it's packed with at least $1,200 worth of cigars, maybe more. Oliva, Rocky Patel, and many others. All together we're looking at $1,700, I am looking to get $1,300 cash, or offer me your trade. I am only interested in rifles from a person with a FID and matching drivers license, who's also willing to fill out a certificate of eligibility together. I also have my FID with matching drivers license. I would especially like a Ruger Precision rifle 6.5 Creedmor, so if you have one and would like to trade straight up, don't hesitate to contact me. Other rifles will be considered, so also contact me and see if we can make a trade?"

I am willing to trade for XD (not XDM) magazines. Honestly I would take .40 S&W or 9mm in terms of caliber. I would prefer full size XD factory magazines, Mecgar 13 round magazines and would hapilly consider the 20 round .40 S&W Promag magazines, though I will ask how reliable they've been because I've heard mixed reviews. I would take the 30 round 9mm magazines as well too I guess. Just be sure your magazines are for XD and not XDM as they are generally not compatible."

LAST ROUND LOCK OPENThe slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR Conversion Kits for the GLOCK pistol.3. INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETYGlock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 4. FINISHAll Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.5. THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATIONInstallation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice.6. ONE YEAR FACTORY DIRECT WARRANTYWarranty covers any defects in materials or workmanship.

While the new OPTIMA V2 shares the name of its popular predecessor, the “Version 2” gun has a completely different design in many ways. Modeled after CVA’s top-of-the-line ACCURA V2, the OPTIMA V2 features the same trigger-guard actuated breeching lever, internal parts, and “neutral center-of-gravity” trigger. Add in CVA’s Quick Release Breech Plug (which is finger removable without any tool what-so-ever), 100% ambidextrous stock, and CrushZone recoil pad, and you’ve got a gun with more quality features than any other muzzleloading rifle in its price range. Equipped with a 26” 416 grade stainless steel barrel, the OPTIMA V2 is easy to maneuver in the tree stand and comfortable to carry in the mountains. Includes CVA’s solid aluminum Ramrod.

I really hate having to sell this gun but really need the money more right now. I have only owned the gun for around 2 1/2 months, I bought it on 11/14/16. Since i have only had it a short time i have only shot literally one magazine of 12 rounds through it. I have used it everyday as my concealed carry in an alien gear tuck 3.0 IWB holster and have loved the way it conceals. The gun comes with S&W blue hardcase, gun lock, owner's manual, one 12 round magazine with pinky rest, one flush 12 round magazine, and extra backstrap grips that you can change for different hand sizes. Please call Taylor anytime day or night @ REDACTED. I will sell to the first person with $425 cash. Thank you all for taking the time to read my post. -Taylor"

This is a Czechpoint-USA import made by C.S.A., so it has all Czech parts. This includes the receiver, internals, and furniture. Rifle is 100% new, as received from the importer this December. It comes with 2 high cap magazines, sling, and more. In 1958 after years of development, the prototype SA.58 was put through extensive testing. It had a milled receiver, with many lightening cuts and streamlined for mass production. It fired using a striker system, which allowed it to be more compact and reliable. Its bolt locked into the receiver using a falling wedge or block, not unlike that used in the German P.38 pistol. It operated with a short-stroke gas piston, which was very similar to the one used in the FN FAL. It fed from curved magazines made of a lightweight but durable aluminium alloy, which held 30 rounds. Eventually after a few more small tweeks and changes, it was adopted as the Samopal Vzor 58. This made Czechoslovakia the only Warsaw Pact nation not to adopt some variation of the AK47 or AKM. The Vz.58, like the Vz.52 before it, was its own unique design. It had a milled receiver, but was still lighter than even a stamped Russian AKM at only 6.4 lbs. It was very compact too. It measured just over 33"" long, with a 15.4"" barrel. It had a 14x1mm threaded muzzle and took a detaching blade bayonet. Everything about it was designed to be slim and lightweight."

Each 5906 was machined from a single block of stainless so frame and slide remained as a matched pair throughout the assemply process, fit and finish on these was near perfect. The slide rode nearly inside the frame, much as a CZ design, on full length lower rails as well as upper. They also had decocker safety and a redesigned delayed-lock firing system for less felt recoil but with the weight that wasn't much of an issue anyway. This particular one came without the under frame rail but they were available to be added on, not sure about now. This one is DA/SA and also had trijicon night sights but they are now very weak. This was a duty weapon at one time so wear on the grips and some holster wear shows but internally it is in very good condition and these will only increase in value. Comes with two 15 round mags and a carrying case. Asking price is 550 or 600 trade value."

It comes with 2 high cap magazines, sling, and more. In 1958 after years of development, the prototype SA.58 was put through extensive testing. It had a milled receiver, with many lightening cuts and streamlined for mass production. It fired using a striker system, which allowed it to be more compact and reliable. Its bolt locked into the receiver using a falling wedge or block, not unlike that used in the German P.38 pistol. It operated with a short-stroke gas piston, which was very similar to the one used in the FN FAL. It fed from curved magazines made of a lightweight but durable aluminium alloy, which held 30 rounds. Eventually after a few more small tweeks and changes, it was adopted as the Samopal Vzor 58. This made Czechoslovakia the only Warsaw Pact nation not to adopt some variation of the AK47 or AKM. The Vz.58, like the Vz.52 before it, was its own unique design. It had a milled receiver, but was still lighter than even a stamped Russian AKM at only 6.4 lbs. It was very compact too. It measured just over 33"" long, with a 15.4"" barrel. It had a 14x1mm threaded muzzle and took a detaching blade bayonet. Everything about it was designed to be slim and lightweight."
