This is a .357 Magnum version and is one of my favorite firearms. I purchased this new last year and used it as my EDC. Whay makes this revolver unique is that the barrel is at the 6 o'clock position as opposed to the 12 as is the norm. This makes it increadibly easy to shoot even with full load .357. It comes with the case, all paperwork, 3 moon clips and leather OWB holster. I'm only selling this to fund a purchase for a more harder to get firearm and will purchase another one soon."

It holds 16 rounds plus 1. It also has a fairly new set of Trijicon night sights on it. With the match grade barrel this has, it's probably the most accurate handgun I've ever owned. It even shoots better than my gold cup. So why am I selling? Because like everything else I own, it's only a matter of time until I want the next thing. This handgun comes with everything: handgun, trijicon sights, 3 magazines, 3 interchangeable grips, dual mag holster, mag speedloader, cleaning brush, gun lock w/ key, and heavy duty carrying case. The only thing missing is the original holster that I lost one day at the range.(the holster sucks anyway) So I am looking at doing trading more than anything but would also do a trade plus cash my way depending on what you have to trade, and I'd also sell if the price was right. As far as handguns go, I'm looking for a super red hawk alaskan but it must be chambered in 454. I also wouldn't mind subcompact handguns like glock 27, beretta px-4 storm but I also like kimbers, colts, sigs, and fn herstal. Just let me know what you have and maybe we can work something out. You can call or text me anytime at three17-six52-five523, my name is Chris. Thanks"
