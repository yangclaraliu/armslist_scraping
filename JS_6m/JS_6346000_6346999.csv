I prefer communicating via emails first, and then will exchange phone numbers when time to set up a meeting. Face to face deals only. Meet around Lexington, Nicholasville or Winchester only. $750 for all. Price is FIRM.  Low ball offers will not get a reply or will be ignored. Sell or trade as package deal only. Will not separate ammo, mags, etc. I like this gun a lot and nothing is wrong with it. But I just prefer my AK- 47. Thanks for looking.* Reduced cash price to $750 (was $800). Cash price is firm. Trade value is $800 *"

This is a ""no tools required"", barrel changing system, designed to work on your current AR15 rifle/carbine. The kit consists of a 12-inch tubular aluminum handguard, an adapter to be attached to the AR upper receiver in place of the barrel nut, and three barrel adapters so the kit can easily accept any of three different barrels. Included in this sale is the black leather briefcase in near-perfect condition with user-resettable locks and cut-out foam inside.Once set up initially, assembly to working condition takes mere seconds – see the video at the page linked below. One real advantage offered by this configuration is that once disassembled, it is completely easy to clean the locking lugs and chamber of your barrel.Note that this kit contains three barrel adapters, not just the one that comes with the standard kit. You can also buy other handguards to suit you, of different lengths or even made of carbon fiber, from TAC2 – https://proshop.tac2.com/index.php?route=product/category&path=20This kit does not include any other parts of the weapon itself: no barrel, no upper or lower receiver, no sights, no BCG, etc. You must supply the rest of the weapon to adapt with this kit. If you need an upper receiver, I do have one available, at additional cost.$250 for everything and it's yours!I prefer a face-to-face deal for cash in the NW San Antonio / Helotes / Leon Springs area, but I'm willing to ship at buyer's expense. Buy it from me and have it today – no sales tax, no dealer fees, etc. I will be offering a few other things, so check out my other listings and let's make a deal!__________________________ Here is a more complete description from the page at Bud's Gun Shop, https://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/product_info.php/products_id/411553112/AR-15+Covert+Carry+Kit+WITH+CASE :AR15CCK COVERT CARRY AR15 KIT with Briefcase - This is a ""no tools required"", barrel changing system, designed to work on your current AR15 rifle/carbine.The system is designed to use a low-profile gas block, and allows your AR15 to be broken down into three major components, for quick barrel changes, as well as covert concealment (DISCREET CARRY), or storage. A 16-inch barreled AR15, with a collapsible stock, red dot sight, and two 30 rd. mags. can be carried in a standard briefcase. Full assembly and loading to firing condition can be accomplished in less than 30 seconds, with ease. This conversion replaces the existing barrel nut and fore end. Kit includes: QC (Quick Change) Barrel nut and lock plate, a 12-inch free float fore-end, fore-end lock ring, all made from 6061 T6 Aircraft aluminum, and black anodized.  Multiple barrel systems require an additional Lock Plate for each barrel, which must be purchased separately. All this is accomplished for a third of the cost of similar systems.  Normal change out of an AR15 barrel requires several specialized tools, a vise, and about 30-45 minutes to accomplish. This system requires a one-time replacement of the original barrel nut with the QC barrel nut, and then barrel change out is done with hands only in less than 30 seconds. Gunsmith installation is recommended for initial conversion, however, most anyone with basic mechanical skills, and the proper tools can accomplish the task in less than an hour.These will only fit Mil-spec Receivers.  They will not fit on the Bushmaster Carbon 15 Rifles. This Covert Carry Kit is for Direct Impingement systems only.Once conversion is completed, deployment is simple:1. Open the briefcase, and remove the barrel and receiver unit.2. Open the bolt, and insert the barrel into the upper receiver. While holding the barrel into the upper receiver, release the bolt.3. Remove the fore-end tube from the briefcase and slide it over the barrel and screw tightly onto the barrel nut.4. Extend the stock, chamber a cartridge, and your AR is ready for action.Lifetime Guarantee on the modification kit - not the briefcase** Includes AR15CCK quick change barrel kit and covert briefcase pictured ... FIREARM IS NOT INCLUDED !!"

This firearm is based on the original Rex Zero 1s, but manufactured to be dimensionally comparable to the Glock 19. This version comes with their factory anodized Flat Dark Earth finish, and ships new-in-box with (2) 15 round magazines, padded hard case, owner’s manual, and gun lock. The Rex Zero is one of the highest quality pistols and best values in today’s handgun market. The Rex is an all metal, hammer fired pistol that has passed extensive Slovenian Military/NATO based tests, and has a lifetime warranty. The Rex allows the user to operate the gun in their choice of modes; either DA/SA or SAO. AREX is an ISO90001 certified company. Their expertise shows in the exceptional fit and finish of this gun. The frame is T7075-T6 aluminum with full-length slide rails, dust cover picatinny rail, ambi-safeties, and ambi-magazine releases. The slide is cut from solid bar stock, coated to protect against wear and corrosion, and has forward cocking serrations. The steel sights can be replaced with any after-market dovetail sights. AREX makes their own magazines, and they are of superb quality. They contain a unique progressive rate spring, are easy to disassemble for cleaning, are coated inside and out for corrosion resistance, and the spring is attached to the follower (can be removed). This firearm can be operated either “cocked & locked” or safely de-cocked for DA/SA operation. The external safety operates in either configuration. The Rex has a 1 piece cold hammer forged barrel made from solid bar stock and is nitrocarburized. A loaded chamber indicator comes standard. Lastly, the Rex is approved for all commercial SAAMI specification +P ammunition. The Rex Zero complies with strict military standards for reliability and has passed extreme temperature, hostile environment, and drop tests. The expected service life for the pistol exceeds 30,000 rounds. Please let us know if you have any additional questions, and don’t forget to check out our other listings!

Ernest has been a been a long proponent of Beretta DA/SA pistols for their accuracy, reliability, and safety. The PX4 Compact was a natural choice as the base of this project because of its rotary barrel design, ammo capacity and smooth trigger pull. Incorporating the stealth levers, night sights, and a lightened trigger pull makes this flat shooting pistol an ideal concealed carry gun. Though it is completely concealable, the Compact offers a full grip for most shooters. The Compact offers full 16 round capacity (15+1 in 9mm), an accessory rail, low-profile slide stop, new integral and retractable lanyard loop, and a cold hammer forged barrel for ultimate precision. The Compact also houses the Px4 family’s rotating barrel system. This system allows for in-line feeding for unparalleled reliability. The rotating barrel system leads to radial dissipation of recoil energy resulting in a significant reduction in felt recoil and muzzle rise AMBIDEXTROUS SAFETY Y BARREL LENGTH IN INCHES 3.2000 CALIBER 9MM LUGER DRILLED AND TAPPED N FINISH BLACK-MATTE FRAME MATERIAL POLYMER GRIP MATERIAL POLYMER MAGAZINE CAPACITY 15.0000 NEWITEM YES NUMBER OF MAGAZINES INCLUDED 3.0000 OTHER FEATURES: TALON GRIP, GREY CERALOTE SLIDE, COMPETITION TRIGGER, G-MODEL OPERATION W/DECOCK LEVERS, FRONT NIGHT SIGHT, LIGHTWEIGTH HAMMER TYPE ACTION FUNCTION SEMI-AUTO TYPE OF SIGHTS FRONT NIGHT/REAR FIXED SIGHT  We accept visa/mastercard/discover at a 3% loss of cash.

I contacted Magpul and since it's past the point where I can return it, I figured I would just sell it to someone else for a good deal. This will only fit mil-spec receivers, not commercial spec. It's literally brand spanking new. I don't have the original box (stupid me, I threw it away), but like I said, it's brand new without a single mark anywhere on it, I even have the receipt to prove it if you'd like. Anyways, it costs $89.95 brand new with free shipping from Magpul, but I'll sell it for $65 plus free shipping via USPS Priority Mail. If you happen to be local to Salem, Oregon, you can pick it up from me in person. I accept PayPal as the method of payment. If you'd like it please message me, or you can call / text me at REDACTED. Here's more info on the buttstock on Magpul's website: https://www.magpul.com/products/acs-carbine-stock-mil-spec"

Bayonet included and in good shape. Serial # is 43885. As stated below it has the Kjobenhavns engraved and also the crown. We will ship. Buyer pays actual shipping cost from Lavergne, TN. 37086. We will use either UPS, USPS, or FEDEX with insurance. For any questions you can contact Lavergne Pawn at REDACTED. I borrowed this info from another site on gun collections: About 30,000 of these rolling block rifles were made at the Danish Arsenal at Copenhagen 1870- 1908, under license from Remington. Usual markings are Kjobenhavns toihuus and date on the tang, with a crown and M-1867 on left side of receiver and a serial number on the barrel and stock. These were made for an 11.7 x 41.5mmR rimfire blackpowder cartridge. If the barrel is marked at top rear with a crown that indicates conversion in 1896 to an improved 11.5 x 51R center fire smokeless powder centerfire cartridge, earning a Model 1867/96 designation. An interesting feature is that the breechblock retains a hole to allow firing pin installation for use with the earlier blackpowder rimfire cartridges. The Danish round is slightly shorter than the .45-70 cartridge, and a bit fatter near the head. While we do not recommend shooting these, some people reportedly fire light loads using trimmed .45-70 cases and only neck size them afterwards. In my opinion it is unsafe and foolish, albeit possibly a Darwin Award winning idea, to shoot .45- 70 ammunition in these. However, given the scarcity of any of the ammo in the Danish caliber, that is pretty much your only option if you want to shoot one."

This stock is similar to the Sage EBR in that it uses an op rod guide that is mated to the stock to make the rifle more accurate. The Blackfeather uses a tension adjustable op rod guide to fine tune the accuracy. It is also about 2 lbs lighter that the Sage EBR and includes three adjustable rails. You can read all the specifics on the stock at the web site M14.ca. The rifle has Smith Enterprises trigger parts. A trigger shoe which allowes the trigger to pull straight back instead of back/up as in the original M1 design. Pulling the trigger straight back enhances accuracy when using a stock with a grip.  It has a national match barrel, front sight, and a Sadlak NM spring guide.   The stock is a MAKO Fab Defense and the cheek riser adjustable and very solid. It has the CASM Gen II scope mount and you can research it at this site M1a.com. The original rear sight assy is included as well. The bipod is a Atlas clone but is a really close match and very stable. I am the original buyer and the rifle has approx 70 rounds fired. The original SA rifle box, paper work, Blackfeather paper work, etc is also included. I had this rifle posted before and pulled it only to be jerked around by the buyer.

Refusing to be constrained by tradition and previous design limitations, the Rhino has improvements that move the revolver forward into the 21st century. Unconventional in appearance and superior by performance, the Rhino fires from the bottom of the cylinder rather than the top. This dramatically reduces muzzle rise and recoil felt by lowering the axis of the bore almost to the palm of the shooters hand. An aluminum alloy frame and barrel shroud make the Rhino lightweight and easy to carry. Accessory rails on the bottom of the barrel shroud on the 4”, 5” and 6” barrel models easily allow mounting lights or lasers. The snag resistant “hammer” is actually a cocking device because of the Rhino’s innovative completely enclosed firing mechanism which can be fired either single or double action. A cocked indicator is clearly visible to indicate the internal hammer status. Another innovation is the hexagonal cylinder which keeps the revolver’s width to a minimum. all Rhino revolvers feature an easy to see fiber optic front sight.Contact Red Rifle 888.968.3925 BY APPOINTMENT ONLY M-F 10am-7pm, Sat 2pm-7pm."
