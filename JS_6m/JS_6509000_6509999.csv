GENESEO, IL May 3rd, 2016 – Springfield Armory® is pleased to announce the Legend Series 1911 TRP™ Pistol. In cooperation with the Chris Kyle Foundation and the Chris Kyle family the company aims to honor the spirit of American Sniper and Navy Seal Chris Kyle while providing direct support to the foundation. While in combat, Chris chose the Springfield Armory TRP™ for its reliable performance and toughness. In his words in best-selling book, American Sniper, he tells how that TRP™ may have saved his life. “In 2004, I brought over a Springfield [Armory®] TRP™ Operator, which used a .45 caliber round. It had a 1911 body style, with custom grips and a rail system that let me add a light and laser combo. Black, it had a bull barrel and was an excellent gun – until it took a frag for me in Fallujah. I was actually able to get it repaired – those Springfields are tough.” Springfield Amory® will produce one thousand TRP™ Legend Series pistols, each with a unique serial number ranging from CK0001 through CK1000. Separately, the company will laser engrave each pistol identifying its placement in the series. The Legend Series pistols will come packaged in a custom and also serialized mahogany presentation case. Additionally, a memorial copy of the best-selling book, American Sniper, signed by Taya Kyle will accompany the package. The attractive presentation case also includes a .999 pure silver Chris Kyle limited edition challenge coin and a Springfield Armory® certificate of authenticity. The MSRP of the Legend TRP™ commemorative edition pistol is $2,499, with a portion of the proceeds from each pistol sold benefitting the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation. The first pistol in the Legend Series was presented to Taya Kyle by Springfield Armory® CEO Dennis Reese at a ceremony during the 2016 SHOT Show in Las Vegas. Kyle immediately announced her intention to auction this one of a kind pistol during the 2016 National Rifle Association Annual Meeting, with all proceeds to benefit the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation. Taya Kyle will auction Chris Kyle Legend Series 1911 TRP™ Pistol #1. This auction will take place in Springfield Armory® booth #5823 at the NRA annual meetings in Louisville, KY. The on-line auction will go live Sunday May 1st   under Springfield Armory®’s charity account on GunBroker.com and will end at 3:00pm May 21st   at the NRA annual meetings. Live bidding will start at 2:45pm in the booth. Persons who wish to bid live in the booth for this #1 Limited edition pistol can sign up in the booth at 2:00pm with a Springfield representative and receive a number and bidding paddle. View live auction: http://www.gunbroker.com/Item/554032581 Taya Kyle will be present to award the winner (if winner is present) with the pistols along with Springfield Armory® President and CEO Dennis Reese. Upon completion of the auction, Springfield Armory® will also present a check to Taya Kyle for the full amount of auction proceeds. The following people will sign the serial #1 pistol certificate of authenticity: Taya Kyle of the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation, Dennis Reese President and CEO of Springfield Armory®, Wayne LaPierre Executive Vice President of the NRA and Chris Cox NRA-ILA’s Executive Director. Now run by Taya Kyle, the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation supports members and families of those who serve. According to Taya Kyle, “One of the big benefits of doing this with Springfield Armory® is that part of the proceeds will go to the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation. The mission of the foundation is to honor God, country and family by serving those who serve. To us, that represents the marriages and family life of our law enforcement, EMS, and military communities.” “We’re very pleased to support Taya and the Frog Foundation,” explained Springfield Armory® CEO Dennis Reese. “When on deployment, Chris Kyle carried a Springfield Armory® 1911 TRP™ Operator pistol, so we felt it appropriate to make this special edition pistol to honor his memory and support the ongoing work of the foundation. Very much like American hero Chris Kyle, this pistol is truly one of a kind.” The Legend Series pistols feature five-inch stainless steel match grade barrels, low-profile three-dot Tritium combat sights, and black and gray G10 grips with an attractive American flag engraving. The slides are forged carbon steel with Black Nitride™ treatment for durability and corrosion resistance. A National Match full-length guide rod rounds out the 8.6-inch long government model 1911. Each pistol ships with two seven-round stainless steel magazines with slam pads. At the conclusion of the NRA Annual meetings shipments of the Limited Edition Chris Kyle pistols will arrive at firearms dealers throughout the country. About the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation The Chris Kyle Frog Foundation, www.chriskylefrogfoundation.org, is a 501c3 non-profit organization dedicated to serving military and first responders through meaningful interactive experiences that enrich family relationships. Founded and led by Taya Kyle, Chris’s wife, the foundation is entrusted to shepherd a community where the successes and struggles of these families can be shared. Its programs and partners reflect the service excellence that these individuals and families provide in service to their communities and country. About Springfield Armory® “The First Name in American Firearms,” Springfield Armory® was founded in 1777, when George Washington ordered the creation of an armory to store ammunition and gun carriages during the American Revolution. In 1794, the armory began to manufacture muskets and spent the next 150 years supplying firearms for every major American conflict. The original armory closed in 1968. In 1974, the Reese family took ownership of the Springfield Armory® name and began making the M1A™ rifle. Today, Springfield Armory® develops many products loyal to the company’s heritage, like the 1911 pistol, while ensuring its future with innovative products, including the XD®, XD® Mod.2™ XD(M)® and XD-S® polymer pistols.Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Free Shipping.Buy this pistol online at www.copsgunshop.net."

Brand new in box never used with brand new battery and mounting rings are included. Nice Optic for AR or Hunting Rilfe or even a 22LR. Very versatile. I am taking another loss here. I paid $125 plus tax and then decided to get an AIMPOINT PRO before getting a chance to use this. The PRO is great but cost $450ish. This optic is a steal at this price. Thanks for looking! Price is not negotiable. You may be able to find one close to this price online if you search really hard but after tax and shipping you cannot beat this price and item is brand new.

This is the nicest gun I own. Many believe it to be the best 9mm range gun in existence. It's the Ferrari of handguns for sure. Look it up on YouTube. Adjustable sights, fully adjustable trigger, and perfect ergonomics. It shoots incredibly flat and makes follow-up shots effortless. The slide runs inside the frame like a Sig P210 and the beaver tail keeps your grip nice and high, so felt recoil is a non issue with such a low bore axis. The 5 inch match grade bull barrel will knock shots through the same hole every time. Slide manipulation is incredible. I've literally never handled a gun like this, it's like it's on ball bearings. The only reason I'm selling is that I owed taxes this year and need the dough, but I'm not in a hurry. Cash only, no trades. This would cost you $2,600 new so I'm knocking off half a grand which is a screaming deal, and it's firm. This is also on GunBroker (for $2,200 because there's a 5% fee). If it sells there first, you're out of luck. I'm an FFL and can ship at cost. Transfer is free if you come to me."

The limbs will top out at about 70+ pounds and can be set as low as 58 safely. Currently set at 70 pounds. -The riser of the bow is in Mathews Tactical finish.  -The string and cable are in great shape as they have been shot very little. I would give them an easy 9 out of 10. As you can see, they are in great condition. -Peep sight is installed, aligned and served into place. -String loop is installed and ready to shoot. -Custom Mathews Color Dampeners are installed on the two large riser spots as well as the small spot in the sight. -The sight is an Axion Gridlock 5 pin in matching Tactical finish. Just a fantastic sight. There are so many fantastic features to this sight that it would be tough to list them all here. Those of you who know and shoot Axion products know of their amazing quality and durability. 5 pins in .020 size. There is also an adjustable Axion rheostat blue light added to the sight. The light mounts in the bracket of the sight, so that it shines only on the extended fibers of the pins. This eliminates any halo that can occur when lights are shined on the pins themselves and helps to eliminate any external light so that you do not spook any game when hunting. Adjustable brightness on the light by simply turning it brighter or dimmer. 2 inch housing with Glo Ring. It also has a Mathews Harmonic Dampener in the sight to help eliminate any vibration and to match the look of the bow perfectly.  -The stabilizer is a Brand New KTech Tech 5 Twin in matching Tactical finish. As you can see in the photos, this stabilizer matches not only in color and finish, but also carries Mathews Harmonic dampeners and a Mathews Harmonic stabilizer. This also helps to eliminate any vibration or noise when shooting. The stabilizer is approximately 5.6 inches in length and approximately 7.6 ounces in weight. The stabilizer and dampeners can be moved around from the front to back position or removed all together to distribute the weight of the stabilizer. It is made from 6061-T6 aluminum and CNC machined.  -The rest is a Trophy Ridge Pro model drop away in matching Tactical finish. This is a great rest that gives you the best of both a containment rest and the drop away. The launcher on the rest can be locked into the up position preshot to contain the arrow for you. That launcher will not drop away until the bow is drawn and shot. With the this rest, you can draw the bow and let back down without the rest dropping away. Very few rests have this function as most other models reset when the bow is drawn. This rest will not drop away until the bow has been shot. The Pro models also have a lock down feature that will lock the launcher into place after the shot to avoid any vibration or noise. The rest is all set up and ready to shoot.  -Brand New braided wrist sling in black is also included.   -Mathews No Cam soft case.   - 1 dozen Easton Storm carbon arrows. Cut to 29.5"".   This setup is flawless and the only reason I am selling is to get a Halon. This bow shoots smooth and I do hate to sell it...but, I only need one bow, so I will pass along a good deal to another bow hunter. All this would be at least $1500-$1700 in a pro shop. $995 is a steal for all this bow comes with. Pretty firm on price. Serious inquiries can get more pictures through text, but you won't be disappointed. Oh, comes with all the packaging for accessories (as seen in picture) and a box for bow included.  Contact Steve @ 703-304-8359. Please be local to Woodbridge. Please only serious inquiries. I am not selling this because I have to...if need be, I will keep and use it this coming hunting season."

The stock is a surprisingly handsome addition to the rifle and it is a Fajen, it appears it was professionally glass bedded in the barrel channel.  Probably the same guy also cut down the barrel to 24"" and recrowned it.  Overall it is a nice rifle, 5 shot magazine loadable by hand or by stripper clip. It makes a nice hunting gun with big game power but I have too many guns and my 6.5 Creedmoor Weatherby is my baby for hunting.  So I will sell ity for 250 OBO, or I will entertain trades. text or email, 717-three04-8947"
