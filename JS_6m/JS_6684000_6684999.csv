Some hate the rugged look but I believe it adds character to the Yugo considering their history and legacy. This rifle is free of the notorious gas valve issues that Yugos are prone to. I spent a couple days cleaning off all the cosmoline when I purchased it which will save you a relatively large headache. I hate to sell but I'm getting married and purchasing my first home within the next year.Text REDACTED if interested."

Built from the ground up, this rifle has been engineered to help you harvest that trophy with the precision and dependability you expect from Daniel Defense.   At its core is a free-floating, 18” Cold Hammer Forged barrel, which comes standard with the DD Superior Suppression Device Extended, for reduced muzzle-flash. This top-quality barrel connects directly to the upper receiver through a robust 4-Bolt Connection System with a patent pending barrel extension resulting in increased stability, better accuracy, and reduced weight. Ambidextrous controls make operating the .308 Ambush comfortable and convenient for both right- and left-handed shooters. You can easily drop the magazine, release the bolt, or operate the safety selector from either side of the receiver. The charging handle is ambidextrous as well and also user-configurable—you can set up either side of the charging handle with a larger or smaller handle to accommodate magnified optics or iron sights for a snag-free setup. The water-transfer printing process (also known as hydro-graphics) of this finish makes for a durable, uniform coating that holds up to and resists even the harshest environments. The Ambush is fed with an optimized bolt carrier group featuring a redesigned geometry and a new extremely slick, low-friction coating to ensure smooth, reliable feeding. As a sportsman, you have an obligation to take clean shots on your game, and a crisp 2-Stage Geissele Super Semi-Automatic (SSA®) Trigger gives you the advantage you need to deliver a precise, on-target shot that’ll bring down that elusive trophy you worked so hard to get in your sights.

A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. The Blackwood features a natural stainless steel slide and black hard coat anodized alloy frame, paired with Hogue Blackwood grips.
