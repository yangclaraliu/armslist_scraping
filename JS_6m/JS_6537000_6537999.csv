It features a three position selector - Mode 1 for Safe Mode 2 for traditional semi-automatic Mode or Mode 3 for Binary Mode. In Binary Mode the firearm will discharge one round with every function of the trigger whether a pull or a release. A user can negate the round that would otherwise be fired during the release function by moving the selector back to Mode 2 and then safely releasing the trigger. Franklin Armory's BFS is easy to install with no custom fitting. The BFS Gen 3 offers a trigger pull of 4.5 lbs. (+/- 0.5 pound) the release phase now has a positive reset and an updated design eliminates backup disconnector. The stronger buffer spring (included) reduces the possibility of hammer follow. It works in Franklin Armory's F17 series in .17 WSM without modification. It works on .22LR and 9mm uppers without modification.

With unfailing accuracy, this bolt-action system continues to define a whole new class of long-range precision rifles. The MRAD rifle's user-changeable barrel system is just one example of this hardworking gun's modularity, available in many additional calibers, The precision grade barrel can be removed by simply loosening two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. The rifle has a fluted and heavy barrel in 24” length for .300 Win Mag. The MRAD also boasts Barrett's fully adjustable match-grade trigger module, which is user accessible. The thumb-operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld. Integrated into the MRAD rifle's 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is a 21.75 inch M1913 rail with 20 MOA taper. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions. The MRAD stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed-stock rifle, creating a rigid platform for consistent firing. Comes in a custom molded Pelican case made for the rifle. Rifle includes a Nightforce ATACR 5-25x56 scope with patented ZeroStop, in .1 Mrad (12 Mils per revolution) increments. A capped windage adjustment helps prevent accidental adjustment in the field. The parallax adjustment is marked with approximate numbered distances and is coupled with DigIllum digital reticle illumination. The 34mm tube allows 120 MOA/34.9 Mils of elevation adjustment. Fully multi-coated ED glass results in light transmission values of over 90%, brilliant images and exceptional color contrast. A magnification range of 5x to 25x, and a wider field of view as a result of its unique optical prescription (17.96 feet at 5x) will cover virtually any situation a shooter could encounter. Included is an Accuracy International 34mm scope mount with built in 3 degree increase in elevation. Includes Atlas Precision Rail Buttstock Monopod. The PRM has push button deployment and retraction feature. Comes with a Thumbnut which allows the operator to ""lock"" the knob creating an extremely solid shooting platform. The leg folds up and retracts out of the way when not in use. The metal Quick Knob (QK) offers fine elevation adjustments and provides for a quick vertical height adjustment at the push of a button. Push button rifle sling also included."

With unfailing accuracy, this bolt-action system continues to define a whole new class of long-range precision rifles. The MRAD rifle's user-changeable barrel system is just one example of this hardworking gun's modularity, available in many additional calibers, The precision grade barrel can be removed by simply loosening two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. The rifle has a fluted and heavy barrel in 24” length for .300 Win Mag. The MRAD also boasts Barrett's fully adjustable match-grade trigger module, which is user accessible. The thumb-operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld. Integrated into the MRAD rifle's 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is a 21.75 inch M1913 rail with 20 MOA taper. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions. The MRAD stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed-stock rifle, creating a rigid platform for consistent firing. Comes in a custom molded Pelican case made for the rifle. Rifle includes a Nightforce ATACR 5-25x56 scope with patented ZeroStop, in .1 Mrad (12 Mils per revolution) increments. A capped windage adjustment helps prevent accidental adjustment in the field. The parallax adjustment is marked with approximate numbered distances and is coupled with DigIllum digital reticle illumination. The 34mm tube allows 120 MOA/34.9 Mils of elevation adjustment. Fully multi-coated ED glass results in light transmission values of over 90%, brilliant images and exceptional color contrast. A magnification range of 5x to 25x, and a wider field of view as a result of its unique optical prescription (17.96 feet at 5x) will cover virtually any situation a shooter could encounter. Included is an Accuracy International 34mm scope mount with built in 3 degree increase in elevation. Includes Atlas Precision Rail Buttstock Monopod. The PRM has push button deployment and retraction feature. Comes with a Thumbnut which allows the operator to ""lock"" the knob creating an extremely solid shooting platform. The leg folds up and retracts out of the way when not in use. The metal Quick Knob (QK) offers fine elevation adjustments and provides for a quick vertical height adjustment at the push of a button. Push button rifle sling also included."

Cerakote has recently released a mixture that matches the tone of Sig's Legion grey - two coatings of this and you almost can't tell the difference, and the durability and vibrance of cerakote far outshines the original PVD. If you have been wanting to try the Sig Legion but are tired of reading horrible reviews about finish wear, then this is the gun for you.

The chamber mouths are counter-bored (""recessed""). Factory finished in bright blue, the condition is excellent and rates about 98-99% with only a few very minor surface handling marks. There is no rust or any pitting. The target hammer and target trigger are case colored and retain all their finish. The factory target grips are excellent as well, free of cracks or chips. The mechanics appear to be in perfect working order and the bore is excellent. The cylinder face shows faint powder burns at every other chamber...evidence it has been factory test fired only. It comes in the mahogany wood case (the interior blue flocking had deteriorated and has been removed), and includes the instruction sheet, miscellaneous paperwork, cleaning kit and screw driver. The serial number indicates this revolver was manufactured in about 1980. A very nice example!"

The SUB-2000™ is a semi-automatic rifle chambered for the 9mm Luger or the .40 cal. S&W cartridge. Different versions of the SUB-2000™ rifle will accept most double column handgun magazines (see list below).  By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000™ rifle can instantly be reduced to a size of 16.25 x 7 inches for ease of storage.   The polymer of the weapon is made of an impact modified glass reinforced Zytel.  Two integrated Picatinny rails come standard on the SUB-2000™ forend for mounting compatible accessories.  The forend also includes five mounting slots per side, configured for various M-LOK™ accessories.  The stock can be adjusted to three different positions for shooter's comfort.  Each position adds approximately 5/8 of an inch to the overall length of the weapon, with a total extension of 1.25 inches in the further rearward position.  The stock includes a single point sling loop attachment, a slot for adding a nylon sling loop (1.25"" wide is ideal), and a Picatinny rail on the bottom for adding small accessories.  The SUB-2000™ features a push-bolt safety located behind the trigger on the grip assembly.  The bolt can be locked in the rear position by cycling the bolt to the rear and rotating the operating handle up into the cutout on the receiver.  The rear sight is of aperture type and the AR style front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation.  The thread protector on the SUB-2000™ is removable, if the shooter desires to replace the thread protector with a compatible accessory for the 1/2""-28 threads (9mm model) or 9/16""-24 threads (.40 cal S&W).  The SUB-2000™ can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools.   The 9mm SUB-2000™ can be configured in the following magazine types: GLK17, GLK19, S&W59, BERETTA92,  SIG226.
