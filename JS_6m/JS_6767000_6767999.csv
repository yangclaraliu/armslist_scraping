A very great starter gun. .40 caliber is very powerful but won't knock your hand like a .45. I owned this for 3 years and just want to play around with a single action gun at this point.Have everything it came with when new.Case, chamber lock, short (9 round) and extended clip (15), two flat bottoms and pinky extension, loader, test fired round, paperwork, etc. On top of that, will include the Hogue slide on grip, soft carrying pouch, and a box A-Zoom Snap Caps (practice ammo). Gun was completely cleaned after every use and will come with a small .40 caliber cleaning kit by Tactical Performance.Looking for $400 for everything. Also have quite a bit of .40 caliber ammo I can include at a good price with purchase.Call or email.

That's because a combat shotgun has to function the first time, every time. The Benelli M4 does it for the U.S. military, and now can be the centerpiece of your own home defense plan. Benelli engineers developed and patented a unique Auto-Regulating Gas-Operated (ARGO) system. Dual stainless steel, self-cleaning pistons located just ahead of the chamber operate directly against the bolt assembly. It's a simple and dependable system that eliminates the complex linkage, springs and heavy parts that other semi-automatic shotguns have to depend on. The result is marine-tough reliability under the harshest environmental conditions. The M4 comes standard with a Picatinny rail for optics, a ghost-ring fully adjustable rear sight, and fixed-blade front sight. This variant features a rugged black synthetic stock and a pistol grip and holds five rounds of ammunition.Model M4 Tactical w/Ghost Ring Sights 11791Gauge 12 GaugeBarrel Length (in) 18.5 inchesChamber Length (in) 3 inchesCapacity 5+1Finish Federal Standard Matte BlackStock Description Matte Black Synthetic w/Pistol GripLength (in) 40"

Very precise measurements that are much, much better than the typical solvent trap, or maglight make-shift suppressor.These can be Cerakoted to your liking if you find that necessary.1/2-28 threadYou will need a drill press to modify this into a suppressor***ONLY do so if legal in your state, AND you are legally allowed to have a suppressor and only AFTER you get the tax stamp from the ATF***---Why you should suppress your firearm---HEARING PROTECTIONSuppressors reduce the noise of a gunshot by an average of 20 – 35 dB, which is roughly the same as earplugs or earmuffs. By decreasing the overall sound signature, suppressors help to preserve the hearing of recreational shooters, hunters, and hunting dogs around the world.SAFER HUNTINGMost hunters do not wear hearing protection in the field because they want to hear their surroundings. The trouble is, exposure to even a single unsuppressed gunshot can, and often does, lead to permanent hearing damage. Suppressors allow hunters to maintain full situational awareness, while still protecting their hearing. The result is a safer hunting experience for the hunter, and for those nearby.NOISE COMPLAINTSAs urban developments advance into rural areas, shooting ranges and hunting preserves across the country are being closed due to noise complaints.ACCURACYOne of the most common problems for shooters is decreased accuracy caused by flinching in anticipation of the firearms discharge and recoil. By containing the explosion of the gunpowder at the muzzle, suppressors reduce recoil, and help decrease muzzle flinch. These benefits lead to improved accuracy, better shot placement, and more humane hunts.---How it works---1. Purchase the legal Solvent Trap that attaches to the end of your barrel of your rifle or pistol.2. Complete the Form 1 tax form and send the $200 tax to the ATF (https://johnpierceesq.com/the-complete-guide-to-the-new-form-1/)3. Wait until you get your Form 1 Tax Stamp Approval back from the ATF (Last I was told about 100 days)4. ONLY ONCE APPROVED - You can now modify and drill out the cone cups and the end cap to allow projectile to pass through the Solvent Trap (now legally a suppressor)5. Go shoot and notice the difference in sound!*It should be noted that Trump has vowed to remove Suppressors from this list that requires the $200 tax stamp fee, once that is done buying a suppressor will be like buying a shotgun - No tax.---Are suppressors legal?---Silencers are legal but are regulated by federal law and on a state-by-state basis by the Nation Firearm Act (NFA) branch of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE). Private citizens can legally purchase and possess silencers in 42 states* without a permit.To purchase a silencer the following qualifications apply:• RESIDE IN ONE OF THE 42 STATES THAT CURRENTLY ALLOW CIVILIAN OWNERSHIP• BE A RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES• BE LEGALLY ELIGIBLE TO PURCHASE A FIREARM• PASS A BATFE BACKGROUND CHECK• BE AT LEAST 21 YEARS OF AGE TO PURCHASE FROM A DEALER• BE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OF AGE TO PURCHASE FROM ANOTHER CITIZENhttps://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2015/05/jeremy-s/nfa-for-beginners-form-1-to-manufacture-an-nfa-item/https://johnpierceesq.com/the-complete-guide-to-the-new-form-1/"

These are great shooting pistols and were introduced in the early 1990’s. The P7M10, like the 9mm P7 models, is a fixed barrel, gas delayed, striker fired blowback pistol. They are of superb quality and craftsmanship. In my opinion, the P7 series pistols are the finest handguns HK ever built in their 50-year history. Accuracy is excellent, due to the 4” fixed barrel and the low bore axis makes them point very naturally. The P7M10 is the model that was brought onto the market for the then-new 40S&W cartridge. As the name would suggest, the magazine holds 10 rounds. In typical HK fashion, it was built to very high standards of excellence. This particular example was made in West Germany in 1992. It has the factory nickel finish and is in outstanding condition inside and out with a mint bore. I’ve owned the gun since 2008. I don’t shoot much 40S&W, so it was shot less than 200 rounds by me. It was perfectly reliable with minimal recoil. I have no idea how much it was shot prior to me owning it. Judging from the great condition, I would guess not too much. Both the steel and the grips are like new, This is perfect for the Heckler & Koch collector or German pistol collector. It’s also perfect for someone who wants a great shooting pistol for the range. This HK will last a lifetime. Its built like a tank. It comes as shown with no box or papers and one magazine. Free shipping."

Product Description The VP Series is Heckler & Koch's first striker-fired HK since the P7 series pistols introduced in the 1980s. It is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. The VP Series integrates a striker firing system with an enhanced, HK ""light pull"" trigger. HK's cold hammer-forged barrel made from cannon grade steel ensures long service life, as does the polygonal bore profile which also provides a slight increase in muzzle velocity. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame, and the paddle-style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A unique VP feature is HK's patented rear-mounted charging supports on each side of the slide provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK's hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP SK subcompact models feature a more concealable design with a shorter barrel, abbreviated Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail, and a compact grip frame which retains the adjustable VP grip feature of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels. SK models can also use a variety of HK magazines - compact double stack 10- and 13-round with flat or extended floorplates, in addition to proven HK P30 steel magazines.

This rifle is in great condition for its age and compared to others seen online for sale. Excellent rifling, good push rod and all matching MMs. This is an original brittish Snyder that has made its way through a foreign army at one time because there seems to be number markings on the breech. I doubt you will find another like this. If you collect antiques or rare rifles this one is for you at a great price.The British .577 Snider–Enfield was a breech-loading rifle. The American Jacob Snider invented the firearm action, and the Snider–Enfield was one of the most widely used of the Snider varieties. The British Army adopted it in 1866 as a conversion system for its ubiquitous Pattern 1853 Enfield muzzle-loading rifles, and used it until 1874 when the Martini–Henry rifle began to supersede it. The British Indian Army used the Snider–Enfield until the end of the nineteenth century.Cash only thanks for looking"

Very little use on AR. Have boxes/accessories. When situations demand split-second target acquisition and maximum field of view, mount up the StrikeFire II and shoot—both eyes open. Feature-rich, versatile and reliable, the StrikeFire II is a great choice for shooters who want a quality red dot sight, but don’t want to break the bank. Sleek rear-facing controls allow for easy adjustment of ten dot intensity levels—lowest two settings are night-vision compatible. The 30mm aluminum alloy chassis provides extra-high recoil rating and is waterproof and fog proof. Simple, fast, effective—the VMX-3T Magnifier will work with any of our red dots but it is not recommended for use with the prism scopes. The push-button design of the VMX-3T engages and disengages the flip-mount, allowing the magnifier to lock in place. The result, 3x magnified or unmagnified views at will. Optics are fully multi-coated for optimal light transmission. Lightweight and tough; hard-coat-anodized machined-aluminum construction ensures durability. Internally nitrogen purged for reliable waterproof/fogproof performance. Ultimate magnified versatility for virtually any AR-height red dot sight."

I really like the Mossberg 500 Cruiser with the Pistol Grip, but would consider almost anything (really not looking for a Single Shot though). I would prefer something with a barrel 20"" or under, but once again, I would consider most things.Pump or Lever Action would be my preference, with Semi-Auto and double barrel/over-under slightly less. I would also prefer to stay at/under the $400 range, but that isn't written in stone either.Please shoot me a message if you have something you are willing to move, and we can discuss.Thanks!"
