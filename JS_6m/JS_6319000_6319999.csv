Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN SCAR MK 16/16S, and others.Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring for commonality, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning.In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit. Made in U.S.A.FEATURES-Next-generation impact and crush resistant polymer construction-Modified dimensions allow for wider compatibility with non Colt-spec platforms-Constant-curve internal geometry for smooth feeding-Anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability-Long life USGI-spec stainless steel spring for parts commonality-Over-travel insertion stop on the spine-Ribbed gripping surface and new aggressive front and rear texture for positive magazine handling-Paint pen dot matrix panels on the bottom of the body to allow for identification marking-Flared floorplate aids magazine handling and disassembly yet is slim enough for use with many double and triple pouches-Pop-off Impact/Dust Cover to minimize debris intrusion and for ammunition protection in storage and transit"

Sights and trigger added By PointBlank Range.
 
The Apex Duty/Carry Kit for the s&w M&P Shield was designed to provide the Shield pistol owner a smooth, consistent trigger pull that is approximately 2 lbs lighter (based on variations in factory tolerances) with the advantages of shorter over-travel and more detectable trigger reset.
 Results – Reduces trigger pull by approximately 2 lbs. – Smooth uptake and reset– Reduces reset length– Reduces over-travel"

The USP handgun by H&K has been somewhat retired from production, but it still remains an excellent gun nonetheless. The lightweight frame coupled with a precision slide assembly make this an extremely accurate tactical pistol with very few equals on the market. This particular firearm comes with an attached Crimson Trace green laser unit that adds little to no extra weight on the front end with the added benefit of being the finest tactical laser unit available. Here's the best part: this gun is chambered in 9mm making ammunition readily available and extremely inexpensive!"

There is an endless list of reasons why you need one: used by 65% of law enforcement, damn near impossible to break, simple construction with only 34 moving parts, the G19 model is the most widely carried gun in the world by professionals and civillians...the list goes on and on! This particular firearm is outfitted with TALO brand tritium sights that glow in the dark with a halflife of about 150 years so no worries when it comes to holding a charge when you need them most! Additionally, this is a Generation 4 model that has been upgraded with rough texturing, interchangable backstraps, and a reinforced recoil spring.  Whenever a Glock G19 makes its way out for sale, they last about 2-3 days before someone buys it so get in here!"
