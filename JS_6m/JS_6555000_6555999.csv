A standard 5.56mm NATO Nitride chamber and bore ensure reliable function in any environment. An adjustable gas valve allows operators to increase the flow of gas when using lower pressure ammunition or when adverse conditions require additional energy. Reduced flow and the off-position enhance the use of suppressors. Barrels feature an A2 flash suppressor and are threaded 1/2×28 TPI, allowing the SIG516 to adapt to a number of aftermarket accessories and suppressor mounts."

The heavier weight of the carrier aids in a longer dwell time, allowing barrel pressure to be greatly reduced and promoting easier extraction.Made from tool steel thenIsonite treated, this carrier will be the one you want for all of your Direct Impingement rifles.Isonite coating (similiar to Nitride) makes for extremely smooth operation and easy cleaning.UPGRADE YOUR STANDARD PHOSPHATE CARRIER NOW"

Includes: Soft Case - Manual - Mag Extender - No Box  You may have thought that there was nothing left to be said about the pump shotgun. That was before Benelli applied Italian engineering and style to this most American of shotgun designs and the innovative Nova Pump took the market by storm. Doubters predicted that American shooters would never accept a gun that replaced the traditional wooden buttstock and separate external receiver with a single unit that encased the steel action directly in lightweight, weather-resistant polymer. They couldn’t have been more wrong! American shooters flocked to the stylish, ultramodern 12-gauge and for more than four years the Nova Pump has established an unchallenged reputation of dependability, capable of handling everything from dove loads in the autumn haze to thumping waterfowl loads in driving rain. Shoot the Benelli Nova and you’ll never think about pump shotguns in quite the same way.

The scope mounted on it is the factory scope. That's not an 800 yard scope, but it's served me well out to 250 yards (it can work farther, 250 is the farthest range I've shot at).  *It is worth noting that this rifle is NOT effected by the safety recall due to unintentional discharge*The ADL model does not have a detachable magazine, you load the internal magazine from the top, similar to many vintage rifles. I'm not an expert marksman by any means, but I can regularly do 5 shot groups and get less than 0.75 inch on those groups using a handload which consists of the properly sized case, CCI primer, 38.6 grains of Hodgdon Benchmark, and a 168 grain hornady match bullet.  Just figured I'd include thst information if a reloader happens to be looking at this.I don't want to sell this, but I recently had an unexpected emergency vet bill pop up, so I need to set my priorities to pay for the expenses. This rifle new is generally $450 or so. The rifle is in a very good condition with no evident rust, dents or scratches. With this in mind, I'd like to ask $375, but am open to offers as long as its not a blatantly lowball offer. I'm located in the Southwest Columbus area near the 270 ramps at Georgesville Rd (exit 5). I can meet around here, Hilliard, Grove city, or similar distance areas. Thanks"

Its reduced size allows it to readily disappear under regular clothing. The CZ 75 DA/SA action with a manual safety lever provides the user with two options for carry: hammer-back with the safety on for single action operation or manually decocked for a double action first shot with no need to remember to take off the safety before firing. Because the 75 Compact retains the steel frame of the original 75, only 2.4 oz of weight is lost, making it the softest-shooting compact in the CZ 75 line.          SPECIFICATIONS   CZ 75 Compact – 9mm CZ 75 Compact – 9mm (low capacity)        Product Name  CZ 75 Compact – 9mm   SKU  91190   Firearm Type  Handgun   Purpose  Concealed Carry   MSRP  $544.00   Chambering  9mm Luger   Magazine Capacity  14   Magazine Type  Double Stack   Frame  Steel   Grips  Plastic   Trigger Mech  DA/SA   Sights  Fixed   Barrel  Cold Hammer Forged   Barrel Length  3.75 in   Weight  32.8 oz   Overall Length  7.24 in   Height  5.03 in   Width  1.38 in   Safety  Manual Safety, Safety Stop on Hammer, Firing Pin Block Safety"

Its reduced size allows it to readily disappear under regular clothing. The CZ 75 DA/SA action with a manual safety lever provides the user with two options for carry: hammer-back with the safety on for single action operation or manually decocked for a double action first shot with no need to remember to take off the safety before firing. Because the 75 Compact retains the steel frame of the original 75, only 2.4 oz of weight is lost, making it the softest-shooting compact in the CZ 75 line.          SPECIFICATIONS   CZ 75 Compact – 9mm CZ 75 Compact – 9mm (low capacity)        Product Name  CZ 75 Compact – 9mm   SKU  91190   Firearm Type  Handgun   Purpose  Concealed Carry   MSRP  $544.00   Chambering  9mm Luger   Magazine Capacity  14   Magazine Type  Double Stack   Frame  Steel   Grips  Plastic   Trigger Mech  DA/SA   Sights  Fixed   Barrel  Cold Hammer Forged   Barrel Length  3.75 in   Weight  32.8 oz   Overall Length  7.24 in   Height  5.03 in   Width  1.38 in   Safety  Manual Safety, Safety Stop on Hammer, Firing Pin Block Safety"

Today's replacement value would be over $15,000. The first pictures show this barrel when it was first made in process of being polished. Although starting to patina, if you decide to polish it bright again, all the muzzle markings will be clear - they were stamped very deep. All the markings are EXACT as they would have been in 1863. Barrel Serial Number and Foundry Number are also EXACT for an 1863 Barrel. Custom stamping of ""3rd Wisconsin Cavalry"" ""Company C"" correspond to ""The Battle of Baxter Springs, Kansas"" where Capt. James Burton Pond of 3WC, earned the Medal of Honor using a 12 pound Mountain Howitzer to save his men from a surprise attack from Quantrill's Raiders. This barrel has been fired only approx. 250 times during the 4th of July Festival called ""Sawdust Days"" in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. (blanks only) The Later pictures show how the barrel has been aging over the years with patina starting to form. In another 5 years and it will look like it was made in 1863.

The price includes 50 pre-rolled cartridges for quicker reload, 1.5 pounds of black powder, approximately 150 rounds of .454 and .450 round balls, and three containers of percussion caps (#10 from CCI). I have only fired this gun 30 times, but it's a straight shooter and puts pretty big holes in whatever you aim at. As it is a brass frame revolver, I have never fired loads hotter than 20 grains, but it will easily do 25+. Always cleaned and lubed after use and stored in a cool, dry place. The loading ram that attaches to the loading rod fell off somewhere in my brother's truck, but once I find it I'll reattach it. If I can't find it before this sells, I will knock $50 off of my asking price. Loading tables are less than $20 on Amazon, so that works in your favor. FFL is not required for purchase, but I am not shipping the gun because the cylinder is primed and loaded and it is rediculously expensive to ship black powder.

Deeper, longer and more slide serrations result in a better grasp when operating the slide. The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip and three included backstraps tailor the fit to the hand of any shooter. Angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by hands of almost any size without twisting or adjusting hold on the shooting grip. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, the process is easier and faster.

Founded on September 8th, 1565, St. Augustine was already 42 years old when English settlers established Jamestown, VA. The “Ancient City” has a wonderful collection of homes, museums, and historic sites that teach and pay tribute to those that influenced its foundation. The people of St. Augustine will continue to celebrate this long lasting legacy throughout 2015. Whether it’s the cultural diversity, architecture, or beautiful beaches, it’s easy to see why its residents are proud to call this place their home. It is because of this rich history that American Legacy Firearms presented the St. Augustine Rifle! Built on a fully functional Henry Model H009B Lever Action .30-30, this rifle’s receivers are plated with 24 karat gold and has a stock made from American walnut. Only 45 were available in this edition. Like most of our other firearms, Henry is manufactured in America. It holds 5 rounds and has a 20” octagon barrel. This firearm is engraved with historical events, people, and structures on the rifle’s receivers, grips, and forearms. Each engraving is specific to St. Augustine’s history, emphasizing the things that make this city so special and unique. Although this base model has been often used for deer hunting, this 24 kt. gold plated and engraved Henry will make this rifle a treasurable heirloom for generations to come. In addition to the rifle’s value, an upgraded French-fitted case with velvet interior was included."

The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is the most stable, collapsible stock available due to the innovative cam-lock system developed by Bill Rogers, famed shooting instructor, inventor of holsters, target systems, and other related products, and his staff of engineers. The cam-lock system completely removes any slop or play inherent with collapsible stocks. Once the desired stock position has been selected, the stock can be locked down solid simply by clicking the cam-lock lever upward. Pressing the quick-release lever will disengage both the cam-lock, and the detent pin, allowing you to quickly readjust the stock position. The innovative Rogers Super-Stoc™ also removes the guesswork involved with buffer tube sizes. The stock will fit both a Mil-Spec sized buffer tube as well as a Commercial sized buffer tube with a few simple adjustments. Weighing in at only 7.3 oz, it is among the lightest stocks available, but rugged enough to pass a 36"", fully loaded drop test."
