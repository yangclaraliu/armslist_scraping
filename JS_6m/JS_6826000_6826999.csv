Brand new in the package and they all have dust covers. These things are great for when you get the chance to mag dump or just to keep loaded and handy if you're prepping. These are super solid and keeping them loaded over a long period of time does not affect their functionality. Some people might disagree with me but those are the same people who have only ""heard from someone who read a blog written by someone who read something on the interenet 2 years ago that you can't keep pmags loaded."" yeah... right.I know from first hand experience that keeping them loaded to full capacity doesnt hinder their performance. I've had gen 2 and 3 pmags loaded for 1 and 2+ years and used them flawlessly.Anyway, I have 5 possibly 6 and these are $17 PER MAG. These average from $18-$20 so $17 is fair especially since you don't have to pay tax or shipping. And you also don't have to wait for them to come in.

If the ad is up, this rifle is still for sale.This piece is in very good condition, with good bluing and a very nice looking, solid stock with some nice tiger-striping.This 1943 Sako M39 Finnish war horse has been there and done that but is still in very good condition. Aside from a bit of wear to the sling swivels, I'd say that the bluing conservatively at over 80%.  You might disagree ... you might call it 85%!! 
The serial number is 233xxx on the barrel.  The butt plate is not numbered, and the magazine floor plate and bolt are mismatched, not uncommon with these Finnish Mosins.   The muzzle has NOT been counter bored, and the bore shows some wear, but is in good condition.The stock is solid, has no issues, and looks very good.It has the SAKO gearwheel cartouche on the right rear of the buttstock, alongside the crossed Cannon stock maker's cartouche with an S inside, the symbol for subcontractor Sakara Oy . 
After the war ended the AH Empire broke up, and newly-independent Finland bought up all the Mosins they could to arm themselves, building an M39 from this receiver.  
 
A classic Improvement on the Soviet Mosin Nagant, the M39 was one of Finland's mainstay weapons during the Winter and Continuation Wars of World War 2.
Chambered in 72x54r, this was made in Riihimaki
at SAKO, Suojeluskuntain Ase-ja Konepaja Osakeyhtio (Firearms and Machine Workshop of the Civil Guard).
Hey forget about getting Sako's TRG M10, this is much better.
 
There is a tiny CAI import mark near the muzzle behind the front sight.

It has been kept in a HUMIDITY CONTROLLED safe since the day of purchase. It has also NEVER been fired. The buttstock, in addition to its folding feature, has a soft recoil pad, and the length and comb height are adjustable to fit the shooter. The AR-style thumb safety can be switched for right-handed or left-handed use. The pistol grip is of AR style also, and the MRAD will accept any AR-style pistol grip. The magazine release is perfectly located, easy to use, and ambidextrous. The muzzle brake is removable to allow for the use of a sound suppressor, and the brake is very effective. The Barrett MRAD is, so far, the apex of 338 Lapua rifle development. It is a rifle that is relatively light weight, very portable, beautifully crafted, and superbly accurate. It can reliably engage targets out to a mile and beyond, and does so with very little recoil. It is an excellent choice for those who want to reach out and engage long range targets, and to do so reliably. You will never regret buying the best. Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x56 Mil Dot Riflescope C239: Many consider the Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x56 to be the ultimate long range scope. It’s 56mm objective lens provides maximum clarity and resolution across the entire magnification range. This advanced field tactical scope has a wide magnification factor that allows precision accuracy at the longest ranges yet is highly effective for shots at close ranges. The design of this scope exudes ruggedness and that is exactly what it is. With 100 MOA of elevation travel and 20 MOA or 10 mils of travel per turret revolution respectively per turret version, no target will be out of range of this scope. Optional Nighhtforce Zero Stop elevation turret and standard illuminated reticle compliment the side parallax adjustment rounding out the most popular rifle scope Nightforce has yet produced. So whether you are a long range hunter or a tactical shooter, this rifle scope will be all that you will ever need."

Barely broken in. Comes with everything from the factory including the box, all paperwork, factory test cartridge, one 7 round magazine, and one 8 round magazine. Mostly just interested in selling, but I'll entertain offers.The Ruger® SR1911® Semi-Auto Pistol is the same design as the standard-issue 45 caliber M1911 sidearm used by the United States Armed Forces from 1911 to 1985, only made Ruger tough with modern features you would only expect on a custom gun. The Ruger SR1911 is made of high quality stainless steel, manufactured with an ultra-modern precision CNC-controlled machining process that results in a superior slide-to-frame fit, and smooth cycling of the action. The barrel and bushing are also machined from stainless steel to provide excellent accuracy. The frame and slide of the Ruger 1911 are finished with a low-glare bead-blasted finish, and the slide is serrated to provide a positive grip while cycling the action by hand. To enhance the potential accuracy of the Ruger SR1911, the pistol features a lightweight, aluminum skeletonized trigger, with an adjustable over-travel stop. The trigger pull is light and crisp with no creep, with a quick, positive reset. A lightweight skeletonized hammer provides instant lock time, and ample serrated surface for positive thumb engagement. The Ruger 1911 has an oversized beavertail grip safety, and an extended thumb safety and slide stop lever provide for fast, positive manipulation. A visual inspection port allows for a visual confirmation that chamber is loaded. The slide on the SR1911 is dovetailed for both front and rear sights; the pistol comes with a Novak® LoMount Carry rear sight and standard front sight that provide optimal target acquisition with a 3-dot sight system, and are ideal for holster carry. The Ruger SR1911 Semi-Automatic Pistol uses standard 1911 magazines, and accepts all standard 1911 parts, and aftermarket 1911 accessories. The M1911 pistol has proven itself over years to be a rugged and reliable sidearm for self defense, Ruger has proven for years they can manufacture high quality firearms at an affordable price, combining the two results in the Ruger SR1911—one of the best handguns for self defense of all time."

This is the 4.2 inch fastback cut version of the full-size standard 1911. Pistol has about 300 rounds through it. Certified gunsmith polished the trigger bar and internal components creating an extremely smooth and crisp trigger. This is a 1911, they are known as the standard in single action semi-auto triggers.... This is an absolutely amazing trigger. Almost zero over travel and a very crisp 4lb break. This can be adjusted and ""Detuned"" with a simple small allen wrench. Other than the trigger work the gun is just how it came from the factory. Comes with the two original Sig 8rd mags. All original paperwork and box. This gun was sent to me direct from Sig Sauer without being on a self being handled or played with. Gun is in exceptional condition and has been maintained as such. There is no ""$100"" scratch from take-down as is common on 1911's.  She has become a safe queen so its time to move on to something I will shoot more often. Not interested in trades, money is going towards a .308 build. Two Wilson Combat low-profile 8rd mags can be included for extra $$. These are the standard for 1911 mags and fit the bobtail cut of the Nightmare Carry very well as seen in the last picture. Local sales only, must have a valid CCW.

Made by the German company Rohm, it was produced in its U.S. factory in Miami, FL under the name RG Industries, after the 1968 Gun Control Act prohibited importation of small pistols. These were known as Saturday Night Specials in their heyday, but today are referred to as mouse guns, and are starting to become collectible.My non-professional evaluation is this pistol is in good condition, with some patina on the slide, and a shiny bore with pronounced rifling and no apparent corrosion. I have test fired it and it functions well, except for a tendency to misfeed or stovepipe, a characteristic well known for this type of pistol (tweaking the magazine feed lips might help with this issue). The internal parts are all in good working order, including the firing pin and springs. Accuracy is surprisingly good at intended ranges (5-7 yards) because the barrel is fixed to the frame due to its blowback design. Disassembly of these pistols is relatively simple once the process is understood (consult YouTube).This example had its slide and grips replaced with original factory parts in the mid-1970s (the old replaced parts will be provided to the buyer). Replacement parts are still available from websites such as Numrich Gun Parts, Bob's Gun Shop, and on the Gunbroker auction site.Will meet buyer at FFL within 15 miles of West Chester, PA.
