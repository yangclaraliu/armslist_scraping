The description of the "".30 caliber Pistol"" indicates the receiver was manufactured from ""4140 certified forging"".

The .30 M1 Carbine drawing appears the same as the one in the 1964 Gun Digest, clearly showing a GI type barrel band with attached bayonet lug.

Robar’s® NP3® finish is an electroless nickel-based finish for steel, stainless steel and aluminum alloys that co-deposits sub-micron particles of PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene), otherwise known as Teflon™, with electroless nickel. NP3® metal finish offers many benefits; permits firing for longer periods of time between cleaning, dirt and powder residue have no wet or oily surface to cling to. When cleaning is required, the effort needed is minimal – usually requiring only a soft cloth. NP3® is very corrosion resistant. It provides a high lubricity and low friction co-efficient, greatly increasing the life expectancy of a firearm due to reduced friction wear. NP3® can be plated to all internal parts giving smoothness to the action not found with any other coating. In cases where the NP3® has been perforated, the corrosion shows no tendency to spread or migrate under the coating. Cost to treat a gun with NP-3 inside and out is $330."

Our patent-pending NW Ignition System features a modified version of our Quick Release Breech Plug (QRBP) – the only breech plug that is completely finger removable even after multiple firings. This “NW QRBP” has four milled “windows” around the gripping surface, which renders the ignition “open to the elements” as required the muzzleloading regulations of these states. It also features an integral nipple designed for use with traditional Musket Cap primers, and the face of the plug is funnel shaped for more reliable ignition with loose propellants. Plus, a firing pin sized specifically for musket caps and a stronger firing pin spring provide fast and reliable ignition of the propellant charge. Note: CVA’s Northwest line of muzzleloading rifles were developed and tested using RWS musket caps. For this reason, we strongly recommend using RWS musket caps with these guns.
