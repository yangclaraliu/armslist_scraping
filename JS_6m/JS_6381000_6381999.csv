This early rifle should have all USGI parts. It came with a nice bedded walnut stock and I took it off to preserve it, and replaced it with the USGI stock and camo'd it. Both stocks and 2 mags are included.  Comes with the ARMS scope mount shown in pic. Price a new SA Super Match with the extras and see how the price compares!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Would consider trades for a Ruger Precision in 6.5CM or a 1903A4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Thank you."

I hand polished the slide takedown so it should never show and wear and I had ordered a stainless pin set from glock store so this would match. I will put them in the 42.or my 43. This gun still has factory copper grease and round count is extremely low . Under 30 for sure. Cash price is 450.00 for gun . I have a sticky in pocket or waste band I will included for 12 bucks extra. Please text REDACTED I will send picks. It looks like all other 43 that are black with factory tote and speed loader.

You can install these yourself with minimal skills and equipment. I use a vise, brass punch and hammer. I've installed serveral in CZ and Sig pistols. I thought I was going to be buying another CZ pistol but went with an H&K instead. So, save some money if you want night sights on your CZ. If you have never used night sights you are in for a great experience. If you don't have nights sights, or a laser or illuminator, and are shooting in the dark, you really don't have a clue what your sight alignment is. These are advertised as being good for about 12 years. No batteries to fail, always ready to go. $50 plus $5.00 shipping. Text or call REDACTED or email."

The USP series is by far the most stringent tested handgun on the market bar none. The USP has been in the holsters of Law Enforcement and Spec Ops for many years because they work under the worst extremes.Most handgun manufacturers design a 9mm frame and slide and retrofit for the 40 S&W. HK actually designed the USP series around the 40 so realibility isn't a question. It is by far the softest shooting 40 I have ever experienced. If the gun is built around the 40 S&W as the USP series is, the gun will last a lifetime.I love this HK and hate to let it go but I just don't shoot it enough to justify keeping it in a safe - it's just too great a pistol to do that.It is currently setup as a Variant 3 with a decocker only but I will include the decock/safety lever and V1 detent plate also. To buy those parts alone runs $75 shipped.I have only put 200 rounds through this pistol so the frame, magazines, slide and barrel are in excellent shape.I will email more pictures upon request.This deal includes the following:-HK USP 40 Full Size pistol (Date Code AH)-Two 13-round magazines-Original case, spent casing and paperwork-Variant 1 detent plate and decock/safety leverMy asking price is a fair $580 but I will consider respectable offers, just don't low ball. This USP is in excellent condition with a lifetime of service remaining.I have bought and sold many guns through Armslist with no issues and want to keep it that way. I only deal with responsible adults over the age of 21 with a valid Indiana Driver’s License. I don't want your private information - I just want to ensure the integrity of the deal.I would prefer to sell but would trade for an HK VP9 or Glock 19. No other trades wanted."

This is a Brand New, never used custom built upper, not just another improperly slapped together one. I used to work on these for a living so its done right:) I have the same BBL on another build so I can attest to its accuracy. Shoot your average 55gr M193 loads and its sub MOA. But shoot some 77gr OTM and now your making one ragged hole consistently. It’s chambered in .223 Wylde so you can shoot .223 or 5.56 just fine. The barrel was built for the Matt Axelson SEAL (Operation Red Wing) Tribute Rifle. It is rightfully factory dimpled for the Gas Block Set Screws so your gas block doesn’t ever walk. The barrel nut is properly torqued to factory torque specs and proper anti-seize was used. (Aeroshell-33) per Mil-Spec. I really don’t want to part with it but have to pay a bunch of medical bills for an amputated finger. There is well over 1100 in parts, I think 750 is more than fair. PM me with your offer. I’ll throw in some 45 degree MBUS II sights to sweeten the deal if you’d like. Not looking to trade or break it up. Thanks for looking!"
