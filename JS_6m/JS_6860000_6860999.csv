The only issue, or imperfection with this gun is the infamous ""idiot scratch"" which from what I've researched online, can be buffed out with the right technique.Also, when the gun arrived from BudsGunShop.com to Double Action over in Troy, it had a little machine mark on the slide towards the recoil spring plug. I tried myself to buff it out because i hated that it was there because it was the slightest imperfection to this gun that i didn't even put there myself!!! However, due to the fact that I'm not too experienced with the buffing out of scratches, it seemed as though I was making it look worse, so i stopped.Other than those minor marks, this gun is perfect!! It shoots like a dream!! It comes with original case, 2 7 round magazines, bushing removal tool, and also a pair of black Wilson Combat rubber diamond grips that I purchased afterwards.Looking to sell, but would be interested in trading for Remington R1 blued (not enhanced).Or a Springfield Armory Mil Spec stainless."

Thanks for looking!From the CZ website: ""Our longest-barreled rimfire, the Ultra Lux, joins the 455 platform this year. It retains all the same features as its 452 predecessor, including 28.6” barrel, tangent rear sight (quickly adjustable for elevation), beech stock with cheekpiece and 10-round magazine. Just like all 455s, it now has the ability to swap barrels and stocks.The largest draw of the Ultra Lux has always been its incredibly long sight radius, which makes it easier to be more accurate when using iron sights.The 455 models feature an integral 11mm dovetail for scope mounting."""

Gun is in very nice shape with the exception of some very light rust and putting on the upper side of the barrel. Walnut stock is beautiful however and in very good condition. Comes with the original adjustable model #12 C-Lect-Choke as well as the original green & red 'safe/fire' plastic eyes. Butt pad is completely intact (though has many hairline cracks). The plastic slide is very nice w/no cracks. The trigger guard is the same, but with a repairable crack across the lower screw hole. This is one of the nicest examples of these shotguns that I've ever seen, and is a must have for any Mossberg fan. I am also including a soft case with this olde girl. I will ship anywhere in America where it's legal to do so. Which usually means it will either have to go to your FFL holder, or to you personally if you have an FFL in good standing. Or Face-to-Face in the Los Angeles area.

We are having these bolts manufactured to our exacting standards with no Frills added to be able to offer the best BCG at the Best Price. Features 9310 Bolt Material; 8620 carrier and gas key; Properly staked billet gas key hardened to USGI specifications fastened with Hardened Grade 8 Fasteners; Shot peened MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) Bolt. Extractor insert installed. Proudly made in the USA with a Lifetime Warranty.

 
UCT's Exclusive EXO technologyEXO Technology creates a competitive advantage for all kinds of components, because treated parts run dramatically longer and more accurately with less maintenance. Further, EXO greatly enhances heat dissipation, so treated products run far cooler than non-treated parts.
The EXO process is permanent, lasting for the entire lifespan of treated parts. A patented, nodular nickel-boron (NiB) surface treatment, EXO nucleates on the surface atoms of metals, becoming part of the metal rather than merely applied to the outside. In addition, the treated surface becomes harder than the substrate itself, eliminating the cost, weight and degradation problems of conventional hardened metals.
EXO Technology is featured in firearms, weapons and support systems used by the U.S. military and law enforcement and security agencies. EXO Technology is appropriate for virtually any application where reduced friction, extended service life, enhanced performance and lower maintenance are desirable.
UCT's EXO coating looks different from other Nickel Boron coatings. It has more of a dull grey, marbled appearance. UCT technology applies a nickel-boron (Ni-B) family of coatings to metal alloy surfaces. The properties of these coatings make them suitable for applications requiring high wear resistance, friction reduction, uniformity of dimensions on complex geometry, strong adhesion to substrates, and inherent solid lubrication. Corrosion inhibition is an added feature. Benefits include increased life cycle and decreased maintenance costs.

The requirements for assembly of our Bolt Carrier Groups are much higher than most. Before assembling the gas key to the carrier, permatex NO.3D aviation is applied to form-a-gasket around the gas hole (per MIL-SPEC). Then Grade-8 hardware is used to attach the gas key, followed by properly staking per spec. When installing the extractor to the bolt, a crane-o-ring is inserted with the spring to insure proper ejection. Then high temperature grease is applied to the gas rings before inserting the bolt into the carrier, which allows for much smoother operation. These BCGs are inspected to the highest of standards, to insure a high quality product that is 100% reliable for our customer… PROUDLY MADE IN THE USA!

There is nothing wrong with them, They just haven't been used in years, I have moved on to shooting recurve bows. A few of the bolts have torn feathers and need re-fletched but are not damaged. Some show wear, but are in good condition, and some are like-new. Tips are not included. First one is the Horton with the sling. I think that these have been owned since the 80s. Has a lot of shots through it but has been well kept. The limbs have been recently replaced within the last 7 years (Cannot remember the time) but have less than 50 shots through them. The red dot is a BSA and works. Sling, quiver, and red dot included.Second one is another Horton from the 80s. Same deal, has seen some action, but well kept. The limbs were replaced at the same time as the other one. The red dot works, but unfortunately I dont have a battery for it. Red Dot is also a BSA. Both the Quiver, and the scope are included. As far as the bolts go....I have 5 like-new 350 grain Easton XX75 2219 arrows. 4 like new 350 grain Crossfire arrows 6 worn Crossfire arrows (Still in good condition) 1 bolt has a torn feather.3 300 grain arrows in excellent condition. I had to re-fletch one, hence the green feathers. 4 370 grain arrows that are heavily worn. 1 is missing a feather, and one needs re-flecthed. 4 Aluminum 300 grain arrows that are in good condition. 7 330 grain Easton arrows that have been used alot. 2 bolts need re-fletched.Overall, I think I this is an execellent package deal, especially for someone who is starting to get into archery. I can only post 1 photo on here, so please contact me if you are interested. I can send you more photos."
