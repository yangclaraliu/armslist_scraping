I am only getting rid of the gun because I do not fire it often and need money for a new car.  Feel free to contact for more pictures.  FTF sale in Des Moines at one of the local shooting ranges or other place with video surveillance is necessary."

It is double-stack and holds 10 rounds in the flush mag, and 12 rounds in the extended (which also has a pinky rest, giving you a full grip on the gun)I've shot about 400 rounds through it, and it's never jammed. The trigger has a much crisper, cleaner break than my other Glocks, for some reason, but the gun has not been modified at all. It comes in the original box with the factory cleaning rod, bore brush, one 12 round factory extended G26 magazine and one 10 round magazine (comes with 2 mags total). The gun itself has been well maintained and looks basically like it did when it was New In Box. Also, it has the older Glock finish, which I've found to be indestructible, unlike the finish Glock now uses for their slides to comply with environmental regulations.Price is $400, firm. Must be willing to fill out a provided Bill of Sale, and must be legally able to purchase a firearm. I live in Ruston but come to Alexandria frequently, or a half-way meetup could be arranged."

The Model 870 leads the field in safety and performance features. A uniquely designed action with balanced sear - plus inertia firing pin - prevents discharge unless the action is completely closed and the trigger is squeezed and released after each slot. The large, side-ejection port stays unobstructed when shooting over walls, car hoods, and other barriers; the blaze orange magazine follower also permits quick, safe inspection of the chamber and magazine. This positive, cross-bolt safety is conveniently located near the trigger for fast operation, even while wearing gloves.
A recoil pad on the wood and synthetic stock models permit greater control by eliminating slippage while firing. The grooved, steel-lined fore-end provides a better grip, and sling swivel studs are standard on all 870s.
The 870 features a bottom-loading, side ejecting receiver, tubular magazine under the barrel, dual action bars, internal hammer, and a bolt which locks into an extension in the barrel.12 guage 4 + 1WILL SHIP ANYWHERE BUYER PAYS COSTSCC ADD 3%M/C VISA DISCOVER AMEXDEALER TRANSACTION, NICS CHECK & OHIO SALES TAXANY QUESTIONS CALL REDACTEDPOWELL OHIO"

This extremely strong design makes for a rugged, reliable and quite accurate rifle today. This is a great deer gun or a real fun range gun with history. As the previous owner decided to make it look nicer by altering the stock, it is no longer a 100% original military collectible, though unlike most Arisakas, it is a number match gun with the bolt, firing pin and front bayonet mount matching. The stock is now beautiful as compared to the semi-rough finish original. It has a gloss and is slick and smooth, plus, you can see the wood grain nicely. The rifle was cleaned so the chamber and trigger and all areas are free from gunk, dirt or anything. The MUM has been removed from the top of the receiver as almost all were making those with a MUM very desirable. Again, a full MUM would only be great on an all original gun. The letters on the top say TYPE 99. As the bores on these (non Last Ditch models) were chromed, they usually look pretty good and this one is great. Has the correct anti-aircraft rear sight though like most, the side folding wings are missing. If you want to replace them, its $12 but they were useless in WW2 and even more so now. Using bolt action rifle sights to shoot at diving and strafing aircraft?? Youd have better chances if you just point, lead and follow through like skeet. The front sight was modified by the guy too as the side ears are not there. Again, Arisaka parts are plentiful and cheap so $15 gets a whole new pin-on front sight if you want, but the current one was milled down on the sides to remove the ears, so the pin is not going to be easy to remove. The Japanese used the best sights of all rifles, a system partly copied by Steyr for their pistols. Trapezoid sighting is what Steyr calls it but the front sight is a triangle and the rear a small circular aperture. Very easy to line up and center, and for longer distance, flip the sight up, and longer distance, slide the aperture up the ladder. If you have never owned or shot one before, unless you are collecting 100% authentic items, this is a low cost way to own a piece of history. The caliber is very similar to 30-06 as most WW2 calibers were roughly equal (yes, Italy used a 6.5mm but the rest of the major players used .30 to .32 caliber rifles). Ammo is much easier to get than years ago, and if you reload, it is the best, as you can load cast bullets to reduced velocities for almost no recoil, 100 to 200 yard accuracy and low cost shooting. Or, load jacketed or low cost plated bullets for fun. I will help any buyer locate ammo if needed.  Here is the production data for this oneHowa Jyuko was the subcontractor to the Nagoya Arsenal that made the rifle. They only made one block of 50,000 rifles from 1940-1945 and started with 50,000. Since this rifle is serial number 51,952 it was most likely made in 1940.I HAVE OVER 25 PHOTOS TO SEND ANY INTERESTED PARTIESA local sale is best for this one, but if you want it shipped, I will ship to your FFL for $38Modified or sporterized Arisakas are common and usually are less than this, but most of those have had the stock cut down, and other major mods and look TERRIBLE. Look up some, you will see. Without the wood going to the front, it looks awful with the long barrel sticking out. This one looks original at first glance, and only when you notice the glossy and pretty stock do you catch on. The very front of the stock had the button for the cleaning rod release filled in and the rod is cosmetic now. I have never used one anyhow as a new $5 rod from Walmart is safer and easier than a hard steel rod."

This gun is 18 years old and has about 600 rounds through it. Both FMJ and hollow point. It was torn down and cleaned after every shooting session. About two years ago the recoil spring was changed for maintenance purposes and the feed ramp was polished about the same time. It has given me no issues. I'm selling it just to make room in the safe. A bill of sale will be filled out at the time of sale and a drivers licence will need to be provided to fill out the info on the BOS.

I would put it back in the safe before taking less for it. All correspondence will be through email so don't ask me to text you. I also will not travel to sell it for the price I'm selling it.

Looking for someone who knows what they are buying, not just someone looking for a cool weapon.I have a never used Mossberg 500 Tactical 12ga shotgun bought in 2016 from a local dealer. I also bought a hard case for it, that's not meant for this model, but worked to keep it secured. I'm selling it as I have never found the opportunity to shoot it and I want it to go to someone who will appreciate it and put it to good use. Great for home defense, range shooting, etc. Hasn't had a single round shot through it, only racked the slide a few times. It does have some wear where the shoulder slides, but just minor scratches which is to be expected. Selling the case with the shotgun."

The gun is in pretty good shape overall but does have some minor flaws as you can see in the picture. There is a small crack on one side of the grips and the surface of the gun does not retain its original Sheen. As for the weapons used in World War 1 or World War II I have no way of verifying because so many of these guns from this era were confiscated and used in the war. However it was around at that time. Regardless it is an awesome little pistol and it actually shoots quite well. It does include the original magazine!
