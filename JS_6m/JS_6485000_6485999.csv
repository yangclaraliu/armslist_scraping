It seems as though it won't hold a charge but after doing some research it looks like that's just because the felt washer needs oiled and I have no interest in doing that my self so the gun was bought for over $200 but since it needs oiled I'll let it go for around 150 or trades of equal value. Make me an offer. Thanks330 45 eight 9 one 46

For those of you not in the know. These are gas piston rifles. They are much higher quality than your average AR rifle. These are not your budget minded AR15 rifle. And you get what you pay for.  Believe me ! My price is firm and fair.  No, you can not walk into a dealer and purchase one for my price.  And no, you will not find one in private hands even half as nice as this for this price.  So bottom feeders need not waste your time or mine.  If you think you can, then please, by all means kick rocks and go get it !(I have more photos available for serious buyers. Also more than happy to let a buyer do FaceTime and see the rifle. And or show it to interested buyers in person )"

NOTE: THIS IS NOT AN ACTUAL FITZ COLT. The condition is very good to very fine. The bluing is 95-100%.Although I don't know that is originl factory bluing. The gun will come with a Colt letter of authentication. Around 1926, Fitz began customizing both full size New Service, Police Positive, and Police Positive Special models to make them small concealed handguns, much like Colt’s then new Detective Special. This modification included shortening the barrel to two inches or less, fitting a new front sight, removing the hammer spur and carefully checkering the top of the now bobbed hammer, shortening the grip, and—unique to this type—cutting away the front 1/3 of the trigger guard and rounding off the now open edges. This trigger guard surgery left the bulk of the hammer exposed while carefully shrouding the very bottom and back of it to avoid snagging in the pocket. The open trigger guard allowed faster firing, accommodated large or gloved fingers, and according to some accounts made the weapon easier to fire through a pocket (if needed). While these modifications were done to large frame revolvers, they were performed mainly to the smaller Colt Detectives.  ########### NO TRADES PLEASE #############"

This is not the flashlight that you are going to give to your kids to play with or your wife to keep in her purse! The SureFire M951 is designed to be used by professional soldiers and law-enforcement that operate in tactical situations.The Surefire M951 is designed to be used on Mil-Std 1913 Picatinny rail interface equipped shoulder-fired weapons. The flashlight is constructed from durable Mil-Spec hard anodized Aluminum (Mil-A-8625 Type III Class 2) and the rugged CNC machined housings are o-ring sealed for moisture and dust protection.This light is powered by 2 lithium batteries and comes with an incandescent bulb that produces a 65 lumen beam.Surefire flashlights are manufactured by Surefire LLC, which is based in Fountain Valley, California, U.S.A. Surefire produces a wide range of products that include flashlights, headlamps, weapon-mounted lights, laser sights, knives, sound suppressors, Picatinny Rails and batteries; and is a major supplier to the US Armed Forces and US Law-enforcement agencies.""WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THE SUREFIRE M951This is a serious light – As we mentioned above, this flashlight is a serious piece of equipment and is not a toy. This is evidenced by the ITAR notice on this product, which means that it is not allowed to be exported outside the US without an export license issued by the U.S. Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls.It is made from military spec materials – Often flashlights these days are made from cheap plastic that won’t last very long. However this light is designed to be used in tough and dangerous situations and so is made from military spec materials.It has a good switch on/off system – The tail cap switch and tape switch operate independently of each other. When the tail cap switch is activated, the tape switch is disabled. Turning the tail cap switch to the off position activates the tape switch. The system disable feature eliminates the possibility of accidental activation from either switch.It could be brighter – The Surefire M951 comes with an incandescent bulb that produces a 65 lumen beam. 65 lumens is plenty of light, but for a serious tactical flashlight we would recommend upgrading the light to a brighter bulb. The light is compatible with an optional P61 high-output bulb can be used to produce a 120 lumen beam. Some users have also used other LED bulbs to produce an even brighter beam.It is not cheap – The Surefire M951 is not a cheap flashlight, with an MSRP of approximately $285. However, if you want a solid and serious flashlight for dangerous situations the price is not unreasonable for such a device at all. You will get many other flashlights that are much more expensive, but that are not in the same class as this flashlight.WHAT USERS ARE SAYING ABOUT ITThe SureFire M951 is highly rated, with an average rating of 5 out of 5!"

There is a slight drag line, and I really mean slight. The lock-up is tight as new. In fact, it hasn't even been fired enough to break in the springs yet. They say it takes about 500 rounds to really get the springs broken in, and I bet that there hasn't been 200 run through it. I personally put a little over 50 rounds through it. It hits almost point aim with a little adjustment, although my hands quiver a little, so it could just be me. Either way this is a fine shooting revolver. I am open to trades, I might try to slip one past the boss. I am sorry if the pics seem a bit washed out, but the original ones were so dark that you couldn't see any detail."

Glock is one of only a handful of gun manufacturers that's made a huge name for themselves in such a short amount of time. There is an endless list of reasons why you need one: used by 65% of law enforcement, damn near impossible to break, simple construction with only 34 moving parts...the list goes on and on! With the popularity of conceal carry or micro carry class handguns, Glock has released a 9mm model with the same durability and reliability: the G43. Slim, light, smooth operating, and near indestructable, this is a perfect little guy to carry for CCW. This particular firearm has had next to no rounds put through it and comes with a concealment holster."

This is a beautiful 1998 ""born on"" date Marlin MR-7 chambered in 30-06. In almost like new condition with absolutely no flaws, it has a beautiful walnut checkered stock inlaid with the Marlin bullseye, 22"" fully floated, crowned and recessed JM stamped barrel, almost flawless bluing, and a stunning jeweled bolt that was masterfully reworked by Skip Baldwin in Michigan. It is topped with a matching set of Leupold rings and bases and an awesome period correct Swift Model 656 3-9x40 scope. Here is a brief history of the rifle, which is touted as one of the finest and most accurate bolt rifles to ever be produced:The Marlin MR-7 was only made from 1996-1999. It was only chambered in .25-06, .270, .280, and .30-06. It features a 3-position safety, a bolt face encircled by three rings of 4140 steel, a shrouded striker and high-visibility cocking indicator. It has an adjustable 3-6 lb trigger, a forged, machined and heat-treated receiver and an extra-strong bolt lockup. The MR-7 has a hinged floorplate with a removable yet securely mounted 4-shot box magazine (The MR-7B does not). It has a 22"" barrel with 6-groove precision rifling and a recessed muzzle. It also has a classically configured, cut-checkered American walnut stock. The later (1999) MR-7B was made with birch wood for the stock and the MR-7B didn't use a floorplate. It was a few $ cheaper and in 1999 the MR-7B was only available in .270 and .30-06 calibers.The Ring of steel around the cartridge and the strong locking lug bolt-face was mimicked off of the Remington 700.The wing-style safety was mimicked from the Winchester Model 70.The ""Dogleg"" Bolt handle mimicked the Ruger M77The floorplate with the detachable mag was mimicked from the Browning A-Bolt.This would be a special setup for someone's collection or a superb and accurate hunting setup. Also included in the deal is an extra factory box mag which is almost impossible to find available. Asking $650 sale/$700 trade, and I'll consider any nice firearm offers, especially a nice factory built AR or big bore wheelgun. Thanks for looking!"

This shotgun comes in Good, Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition, and features a 26"" long barrel. It does have some light signs of wear/tear, as well as minor usage. This can be attributed to the fact that this shotgun was well taken care of, despite being previously owned, and having been regularly used. There are a small handful of moderate scratches, and scrapes on both the wood stock, as well as on the receiver, which has a minor amount of rusting, and discoloration. There are no major flaws or defects, such as severe chips, cracks, bends, breaks, dents, dings, or gouges. This is a nice unique shotgun that would be a great addition to any collection.
