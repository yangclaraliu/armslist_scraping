The outcome is a firearm with superior suppression capability and enhanced reliability with both supersonic and subsonic loads A two-position gas block makes the transition from subsonic to supersonic as fast as flipping the lever. Changing between 300BLK and 5.56 NATO is as simple as swapping barrels and magazines in a matter of minutes. Converting to 7.62x39mm simply requires barrel, magazine, as well as an additional bolt change. Each SIG MCX features an aluminum KeyMod handguard, AR-style lower controls and utilizes standard STANAG magazines. A revolutionary recoil system does not require a buffer tube, allowing the side-folding Pistol Stabilizing Brace. A picatinny top rail allows for the mounting of lights or optics. The aluminum forend allows for rail sections to be added where they are needed, permitting the attachment of accessories. The lower receiver offers familiar AR-style controls. Completely ambidextrous controls include the safety, magazine release and charging handle.WE DO NOT TAKE TRADES"

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.6” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.
The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

An improved E3 round-lug bolt design both enhances function and increases bolt life far beyond the industry standard. The ambidextrous bolt release, selector lever, and magazine release offers left-handed users the ergonomic advantages inherent to AR15-based controls. The drop-in two-stage trigger severs double duty as an aid to precision marksmanship while enabling surgical speed shooting at close range. The 5.56mm 3-Prong Flash Eliminator interferes with propellant gas combustion forward of the muzzle to significantly reduce flash signature, will not ring upon firing or when struck, and is compatible with the Knights line of 5.56mm QDC Signature Reduction Devices. Specifications:  Barrel: 16""/40cm 1:7 Twist, Hammer Forged, Chrome Lined Caliber: 5.56x45mm/.223 Weight: 6.55lbs/2.97kg Length: 33.5""/85.09cm to 36.5""/92.7cm  E3 Enhanced Bolt:  The E3 Enhanced Bolt from Knights Armament features a number of components designed to make this bolt the most durable and reliable bolt available. It is a proprietary bolt specifically deisgned for their SR15 and 16 models. The E3 Bolt boasts several features that add to the its overall performance such as the enlarged bolt face, rounded lugs, reduced cam pin, and proprietary extractor and firing pin designs. This E3 Bolt is manufactured with an enlarged bolt face that provides more positive engagement in the chamber and lugs which are rounded to help reduce chipping, cracking and snapping. This strengthened design helps to increase the life of the bolt and ensure a proper seating each time the weapon cycles. The E3 Bolt's extractor design is also a unique achievement that helps to provide an extremely reliable component. It's shaped like a rounded ""T"" and sometimes referred to as a ""butterfly"" shape. The pivot point of the extractor is shifted forward to help balance out the extractor and apply constant pressure on the shell which reduces cases of extraction failures. Another stronge feature of the unique design of this extractor is the use of two full size extractor springs, as opposed to the standard micro spring. This allows for a reduction of relative compression while the extractor is in motion and provides a failsafe in case one spring fails. The bolt will continue to function properly and afford a user the opportunity to continue with their mission or firing schedule. The E3 Bolt is designed with a thinner Cam Pin and Firing Pin whose overall size has been reduced. The thinner Cam Pin allows for a thicker bolt web which is a common failure point in normal bolts. The reduction of the Firing Pin size is to accommodate the thinner Cam Pin. The full capabilities of the E3 Bolt are realized when exposed to full auto or extremely high cyclic firing rates yet the bolt performs gracefully under casual firing conditions. This component was designed to be exposed to the most stressful and unrelenting conditions and exceed expectations for durability and service life.  Hammer Forging:  Knights Armament employs a hammer-forging process on a number of there barrels and chambers, which serves to increase the quality of their interior finish, as well as increasing the durability and life of the barrel. These barrels are then Chrome-lined to further the lifespan of the barrel and increase its resistance to fouling and corrosion. The first step is to take a drilled barrel and hone the interior to a fine, clean finish. The barrel is then placed onto a mandrel with the rifling pattern ground in relief across it. This setup is then placed between opposing power hammers which literally hammer the barrel onto the pattern found on the mandrel. The barrel setup is rotated and the hammers continue to forge the barrel into its final shape. Once they complete this process, the barrels are heat treated in order to relieve the inherent stress created during this process. The Chroming process is applied after the Hammer Forging. At this point the interior of the barrel is basically lined with a layer of chrome and bonded to the forged steel. Chrome is approximately twice as hard as standard 4150 steel and also resists the lead and powder that bare steel will normally absorb into its pores. This allows the barrel to be exposed to the higher temperatures and pressures of high firing schedules while still maintaining accuracy, durability and reliability. The end result is a denser, stronger barrel that will endure a higher round life than a Standard Stainless Steel or Chrome Moly barrel.  Ambidextrous Controls:  Knights Armament designed this system to give shooters the maximum amount of options in their controls. Under this design all of the weapon's major controls can be acessed from either side of the lower receiver. Left-handed shooters see the immediate benefits of being able to access the weapon's controls in a more intuitive manner; however, there are a number of other benefits that right-handed shooters will enjoy under this system. Competition shooters benefit from these controls from the increase of speed that is achieved through components such as the right-size bolt catch. Trainers enjoy the variety of options because they can watch their trainee from either side of the weapon and even manipulate the weapon's controls from the non-operating side. KAC has also introduced modifications to the design such as the scalloped safety selector switch. This allows a lower profile for the selector swtich on the non-operating side of the receiver which helps to relieve any interference between the switch and a shooter's glove or hand. For the maximum amount of configuration and operation options, Knights Ambidextrous Controls offer a sure solution.  Two-Stage Match Trigger:  All of the weapons available from Knights Armament come equipped with a 4.5lb, 2-Stage Match Trigger. This type of trigger mechanism uses a system where, during the rearward squeeze of a trigger, it cycles through two stages of resistance. The first stage is a ""no-poundage"" stage where hardly any resistance is felt during the rear-ward squeeze. There is a center point at which point resistance is felt and the second stage of the trigger begins. At this point, 4.5 pounds of force is required to squeeze the trigger through the second stage and cause the weapon to cycle. Their 2-stage trigger is meant to inform a shooter of exactly where their weapon is going to fire. This bolsters a Firer's confidence and can also assist in reducing trigger jerk, thereby increasing accuracy. The 4.5lb 2-Stage Trigger fron Knights Armament is a highly calibrated and smooth component that is sure to be a welcome additon to any setup.  Quick Detach Coupler:  The Quick Detach Coupler (QDC) line of Sound Suppressors and Muzzle Devices are proprietary items designed for secure interoperability. The coupling device itself consists of multiple ball bearings arrayed in a circular pattern which fit into sockets specifically machined into various muzzle devices to accept the QDC. The bearings are aligned with the sockets by way of a V-shaped notch that seats the device onto an index pin. Once aligned, a simple twist of the outer retaining ring locks the device securely into place. This system was developed to provide fast and easy operation and interoperability between weapons and suppressors. Knights QDC line of sound suppressors all feature this method of attachment. Various muzzle devices, such as the QDC Flash Suppressors and the MAMS muzzle break, also feature the QDC pockets to accept sound suppressors equipped with this coupling device. Secure interoperability and intelligent, efficient design are the intended goals of this quick and easy technology.  M-LOK:  M-LOK is a modular locking accessory mounting system that is a direct attachment method for hard mounting accessories to a negative space mounting point. The M-LOk attachment system allows the user to put mounting rails only where they were needed, as opposed to covering the entire surface with mounting rails, which are then covered with panels. The system also allows direct mounting of accessories, such as fore-grips and flashlights, with no rail interface needed."

Also mounted on the right side railing (using a UTG double railed, 3 slot angle mount) is an Ohuhu red green dot reflex sight with 4 reticle options. It has a 5-position tactical flashlight mount on the left railing. I attached a UTG tactical OP bipod and UTG Ambi Foldable tactical foregrip. I switched out the original grip with a Magpul MIAD AR grip kit which came with different sized backings. It has a 1 point tactical bungee sling too. It comes with 3 mags, 25 rd capacity each; 2 black, 1 tan. 1 Plano Single Scoped Gun Case and 475 rds of .22 lr ammo. (Some range ammo, some velocity rounds but mostly hollow point).I have more pictures if you'd like. File size limit was too small to post all of themCash only please. Email me if interested."

Uberti. For decades, their craftsmen have combined modern high-grade materials with time-honored methods of finishing to create exquisite, working reproductions of history's greatest firearms.The left side of the barrel of this Civil War firearm features a 24-karat gold decorated banner, identifying the revolver as the ""American Civil War 150th Anniversary Tribute."" Also featured on the left side of the Tribute are the crossed flags of the Union and Confederate forces. Complementing the overall design are lustrously, hand-polished walnut grips.The right side of the barrel of this Civil War firearm features a famous phrase used by Abraham Lincoln during an 1858 speech ""A House Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand."" Lincoln borrowed this axiom from the Bible as a warning about the mounting tensions between the Northern and Southern states. After his election to the presidency, Lincoln continued to cut through the differences that divided our nation and to remind us of what was necessary to restore and repair the broken union. Both sides of the 24-karat gold decorated frame feature a banner with the dates of the Civil War, ""1861-1865.""The centerpiece of the Civil War firearm is the lavishly illustrated cylinder, featured in 24-karat gold and meticulously decorated with an epic scene depicting a clash between Union and Confederate soldiers. From flags to uniforms to facial expressions, no detail has been overlooked in this breathtaking scene, reminiscent of the carnage during the Battle of Antietam. The September 17, 1862 showdown between the Northern forces of General George McClellan and the Southern soldiers under General Robert E. Lee was the bloodiest single-day battle of the war.In order to display and protect your Civil War Sesquicentennial Tribute Revolver, you will receive a handsome, luxuriously lined display case with each order, including an engraved brass identification plaque and replica Union and Confederate buckles as shown below.Only 1,865 AvailableCraftsmen commissioned specifically by America Remembers decorate each Tribute in stunning 24-karat gold over blued steel, handsomely capturing this momentous occasion."

One of its advertised uses is at vehicle checkpoints, since the heavy bullet’s flight path is not easily deflected by auto glass or standard vehicle body panels. This configuration is best described as a low-velocity, heavy caliber with great stopping power and in the short proximity will kill a buffalo size animal. It’s becoming very popular for use in a wide variety of North American game, including deer, moose, and black bear for a simple reason – the shooter does not create a situation where he has to chase after a wounded animal because .50 Beowulf has enough stopping power to kill most of North America’s game animals on impact.
