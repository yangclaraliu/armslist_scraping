Blaser bought Mauser and in 1996 Blaser made this rifle for the American market modeled after the Blaser straight pull action. And if anyone knows Blaser, their guns start at $3,000 +. The action is really fast to cycle, picture a pump action bolt. Bolt has 16 lugs for strenght and accuracy.The finish is matte and the stock is a beautiful walnut. Both finish and stock excellent. The slight glare in the back of the stock is lighting, that's all.I have never seen another M96 American in 6.5x55. Most were 308, 25-06, 20-06, 270. The 6.5x55 Swedish is inheritantly accurate and this gun is not an exception.Has Leupold bases.$675 FTF or $715 shipped CONUS.NO TRADES PLEASE.Thanks."

It is striker-fired, so no hammer to hang on clothing or for an assailant to jamb their finger into to keep it from firing. It has an ambidextrous manual safety, so it won't go off accidentally in your holster. Many (most) striker-fired firearms do not have this feature. So, you can carry one in the chamber with confidence that it will be ready when you need it and will not accidentally discharge until you flip it off safety.This fine, barely used and tenderly cared for firearm comes with 4 standard 6 round mags, 2 extended 8 round mags, the soft carrying case, instruction manual and the box.

I am a realist and do not expect to recoup what I have invested in the pistol I also do not plan on losing a ton either so before you say there's no need to invest all that money into a Glock you're absolutely right it was just personal preference and I'm going to pass that on to someone else but I'm not just going to give it away. Do your research and see what the gun and all the upgrades are worth and I believe I am asking more than a reasonable price.

Folk's, this Python has Colt's Firearms Master Gunsmith & Designer Albert ""Maestro-Al DeJohn's"" DNA all over it! ***HISTORICALLY: During the first few years of Colt's Python Production, from 1955 through 1959, only Al DeJohn and one other Colt's Gunsmith were allowed to final assemble and test (virtually hand-make) each Colt PYTHON Revolver. It is well known, in the Collecting World - prior to the development of the Japanese Mori Seiki CNC-Computer Tape Machine in 1964, that there were over 300 Human-Hand Operations required to complete the final manufacturing processes; final assembly & test production of each iconic Colt Python Revolver! This very Rare 4-Digit S/N Python is D+ Master Engraved by Robert B. Valade; in the equally iconic 19th Century ""American Scroll"" Motif and beautifully displayed in a solid Cherry Wood Laser Engraved Presentation Case. The Case has a French-Fit Red interior for the Python, a Texas Dug Indian Arrowhead and a .357 Bullet Block. Letters of Provenance are included for the Master Engraving and Master Gunsmith final polish, re-blue, reassembly and Test! Prior to Engraving, this Second Year First Generation ""SNAKE"" was rated at 95% overall condition. As evidenced by its almost pristine full-checkered Colt's Walnut Target Grip Set and very little evidence of ever being fired after Factory Test-Fire! ""VALADE"" signed his Hand Hammered & Chiseled Engraved and artistic masterpiece on the flat of the Cylinder Crane; as shown in the several close-up photos!

This is my second POF P308 and while this one hasnt been fired I can assure you that my other rifle is capable of sub-moa with 168gr federal 308 rounds. These rifles have amazing accuracy with these 20"" fluted barrels.  There is videos on youtube of stock rifles hitting all the way out to 1000yds. Better accuracy then any 308 rifle at this price point. Also it is piston driven so you have reliability as well as accuracy all in one package. The upper/ lower reciever and bolt carrier group is coated with what POF calls NP3. Developed by Robar® in Arizona, NP3™ is a combination of electro-less nickel alloy plating and Polytetrafluoroethylene (aka Teflon™). The result is a smooth, perfectly even, self-lubricating surface inside and out that prevents friction, wear, and corrosion unlike anything else on the market. I can take one single remington oil wip and clean my entire reciever and bolt. Carbon build up and residue wips right off. Its wild. Included in this sale is:- NIB/NeverUsedGEN4 P308 20"" Rifle with NP3 coating, abidextrious everything, fluted barrel, piston operating system ect. - NIB/NeverUsed PMAG 25rd w/ window- POF Single Stage Drop in Trigger installed by POF- POF Hardcase- POF Paperwork I bought this rifle as insurance policy for the upcoming ban Hillary Clinton is sure to enact if elected. This rifle was literally picked up last week from DOA arms. I have the transfer receipt as proof. Never been shot/fired. The ONLY reason why I am selling this is because I want to diversify my rifle collection. It doesnt make sense to have two of the exact same rifles. I wish I would have realized that before I spent all this money.  I will be buying a different .308 with the funds from this one. Willing to accept 2200 for a quick sale. I can take partial trade but im looking for at least 2K cash.  I can only upload factory pictures but mine looks exactly like this. Once we contact eachother I can send you pictures of the rifle. Willing to ship to your FFL. Tags: POF 308 7.62 P308 20 18 16 14 daniel defense noveske ar10 ar 10 ar15"
