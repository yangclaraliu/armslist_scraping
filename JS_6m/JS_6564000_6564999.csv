There are a number of signs of wear, as well as usage throughout this gun, including numerous light, shallow nicks and scratches, as well as minor chips in the receiver and on the ribbed pump-action. There is also a heavy amount of rusting/discoloration on the receiver, and the barrel. This shotgun still works as intended, though the action does stick slightly when used. This shotgun features a  30"" barrel, and has matching serial numbers on most of it's parts. This is a nice, unique firearm that would make an excellent addition to any collection."

The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCK history. Designed to be the favored back up or last resort option for both civilian and law enforcement use, this subcompact slimline design is the perfectly balanced answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It is ultra-concealable, accurate and comfortable for all shooters regardless of hand size. When it comes to size and comfort, the all new G43 provides the best of both worlds. Typically, with handguns of this dimension, the design of the pistol does a poor job of resolving issues concerning felt recoil. This can cause discomfort for shooters who are not familiar with shooting smaller framed pistols. Seasoned shooters are familiar with this and adjust their grip, but have to work harder to keep the pistol on target for follow-up shots. The design of the new G43 allow for a more comfortable and confident shooting experience for all types of users. Manufacturer: Glock Model: G43 SKU: PI4350201DS CeraKote Desert Sand Slide and Frame Caliber: 9mm Luger/PARA. Barrel Length: 3.39"" Capacity: (2) 6 Round Magazine Sights: Fixed Grips: Standard Condition: New In BoxBrand: GlockCaliber: 9mm Luger"

I bought this bolt carrier group for an AR build that I never got around to completing. It has never been used however I am moving across country and I'm trying to raise funds for the trip.

This allows the BCG to cycle smoothly and reliably. In addiction to the added reliability, cleaning the BCG is as simply as wiping it down since carbon won't stick to the coating.Caliber: 5.56/.300BLK

It is perfect for shooters who are already familiar with Beretta tactical pistols, or more in general for those who may not have extensive experience with a rifle or carbine. However, the cold-hammer forged barrel delivers the sort of accuracy that even the most experienced shooters will appreciate. Easy to use, ultra-reliable and low-recoil, it has been adopted by several police agencies across the US, while its versatility and accessorization options have made it a favorite of recreational shooters. Whether you use it for home-defense, varminting, competition or training, the CX4 will deliver what it promises.The CX4 is adaptable to accept any full-size Beretta PX4, 90-series and 8000 series magazines (using optional adapters), thereby saving existing Beretta users the expense of additional magazines. Along with its uncompromising Beretta quality, this is an additional reason why the versatility of this carbine is highly prized by tactical shooters. Along with a Beretta pistol, it helps create the best and most versatile tactical system available today, as evidenced by the CX4’s dedicated following.This light and compact carbine was designed to be completely and easily adaptable to the needs of most shooters. The operating handle, safety and magazine release are reversible and give you the opportunity to train or shoot right- or left-handed, while case ejection can also be switched from right to left. The length of pull is adjustable (one spacer included), making the CX4 easily and intuitively come up to the shoulder of most shooters. The aperture and post sights are user-adjustable, meaning that you can train with (or switch) your favorite brand of ammo without taking the carbine to a gunsmith. And after a day at the range, this carbine is a snap to take apart and reassemble, while its ultra-tough construction and surface treatment make it stand up to the hardest use.The CX4 just begs to be accessorized. Between the front and rear sights, it features a full-length aluminum top rail for mounting optical and red dot sights. It also sports a retractable Picatinny rail that extends from the fore-end, which allows users to mount tactical lighting devices and other accessories. Additional rails can be mounted on the left, right and bottom, thereby providing ample opportunity for customization. Please visit our accessories page for a full list of CX4 accessories.

It is ultra-concealable, accurate and comfortable for all shooters regardless of hand size. When it comes to size and comfort, the all new G43 provides the best of both worlds.

I have went  to a different pistol and don't need both. Would like to trade it into something else prefer pistol and cash but may consider 2 for one trade. The brace is legal and not a stock. Will include letter from the ATF. The fake suppressor is actually just a brake and legal as well. Thanks for looking

(No nothing bad) I bought the gun a few weeks back but some family stuff came up and I'm in need of some extra cash. The gun comes with everything I got with it plus some. It has three 15 round double stacked magazines, a speed loader, grip extensions, standard cleaning kit, lock, brand new box of ammo, and a magnet to mount on a bed or wherever you please. I really don't want to sell it but the circumstances say otherwise. The gun has never been fired before either. I'm only asking $550 firm for everything you see here. I still have the original bill of sale and the gun is registered in my name"
