313,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6846313,For Sale:  VP9SK LE Night Sights 700009KLE-A5 3 magazine 9mm,"Bend, Bend, Oregon",$ 699,"Listed On: Monday, May 14, 2018",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"The eagerly anticipated subcompact model of the acclaimed Heckler & Koch VP Series handgun, VP9SK (in 9 mm) has all of the sought-after characteristics of larger frame VP pistols but in a more concealable design. The highly-rated HK VP precision strike trigger is also found on the VPSK. The VP trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The net result is trigger quality unmatched in production striker fired pistols. A small-scale interpretation of the completely adjustable VP grip feature — consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels — is replicated in the compact grip frame of the VP9SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit any individual user and is a feature found only on Heckler & Koch handguns. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. The VPSK has the features of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the paddle style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. HK’s patented charging supports, found on full size VP pistols, are also present on the VPSK. The charging supports are simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. VPSK pistols can use a variety of proven HK magazines, including compact double stack 10-round and 13-round with either flat or extended floorplates for a more ergonomic grip. The VPSK can also use the same high capacity 15-round magazine used by the full size VP and P30 handguns. Magazine sleeves that replicate the grip profile of the VP handgun are also available. VPSK pistols have an abbreviated Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into their polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. VPSK pistols use a proprietary captive flat recoil spring that helps reduce the recoil forces affecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component life span. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures a long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VPSK’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. Despite their small size, VPSK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. VPSK models are currently available in 9 mm. VPSK pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany and are well suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. A high quality and well-engineered design, the VP9SK possesses all the features and long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. And like full size VP pistols, the VP9SK is value priced at $719 (MSRP). Available Configurations Part No. 700009K-A5, VP9SK, 9mm with 1 flat and 1 extended floorplate 10 round magazines – MSRP $719 Part No. 700009KLE-A5, VP9SK, 9mm with 1 flat and 2 extended floorplate 10 round magazines with night sights – MSRP $819 NOTE: 13-round and 15-round extended magazines will be available November 2017."

Chinese SKS-M, takes Ak mags, for trade. Comes with original wood thumbhole stock and Tapco tacticool stock, may or may not come with vfg as pictured... depends on how badly party wants it. Not your everyday SKS. In beautiful shape, only minor issue being a couple of dings in the original stock (not uncommon for its age) and the rear dust cover pin being a tad loose, unlike it's other SKS brothers' pins being too tight to manipulate without a tool. Note! Tolerances for mags with this gun are uncharacteristically tight, metal mags work best. Tapco mags will fit, but too tightly for me to want to try them out. Unsure of fitment of other polymer mags. In NO rush whatsoever to unload, just wanted to see if interesting offers come along. But I'm not going to be a dick about price necessarily like I've seen on some similar models on AL... Figure trade value of roughly 700ish what with that Tapco stock and depending on number of magazines party wants with the rifle... I have many. Does also include original Chinese-marked 10 round mag as well. Not afraid to travel a reasonable distance for the right deal. Am a Wisconsin resident, so any trade would need to involve FFL xfer. I have an FFL in Hudson, so it's not too far, and I'm willing to travel almost anywhere in the metro to your FFL. Thanks for your time, fellow ArmsLister!"

This firearm has been modified by renowned gunsmith F. Bob Chow. Chow's stamp is located on the frame by the cylinder. Chow was an Olympic shooter who racked up 37 records during his competitive shooting days. He and his wife owned one of the last gun shops in San Francisco until he passed away in 2003. Bob Chow was an incredibly underrated gunsmith. Those who have had the pleasure of experiencing one of his ""accuracy"" jobs on either a Python or a 1911 style pistol will immediately understand what kind of piece this is! This pistol has the best action I have ever seen! The trigger pull is very smooth, and the breaking point is consistent and breaks like glass... Every. Time! The blued finish is immaculate with black rubberized grips. There is slight wear as shown on cylinder. Firearm has been fired seldom in an effort to preserve the work of Mr. Chow. Scope is in excellent condition and the glass is clear and sharp. Comes with an aluminum hard case as well as the original instruction book. Be sure to email with any questions you may have!"
