Info from the manufacturer:
From the combined effort of Legion Ltd, the custom shop of the legendary Izhmash Factory in Russia, and Arsenal, Inc. of Las Vegas, Nevada comes the SGL21 (Saiga) rifle in 7.62x39 caliber.
Manufactured by Legion Ltd in Russia and converted by Arsenal, Inc. in the United States, the SGL21 rifle has everything that collectors and shooters have been looking for – hand selected premium components, custom-shop attention to detail by Legion Ltd, and Arsenal, Inc.’s highest standards of workmanship, give this rifle its superior quality.
Arsenal, Inc. converts the SGL21 rifles in the United States with 922r compliant parts and fills them with features not seen on any other factory Saiga rifles. Performing the most difficult modifications to achieve, Arsenal, Inc. has done a substantial work for the customer. The end result is the highest quality SGL21 rifle with the most desired features which have not been available before. Every unit is laser sighted and test fired.
To make this rifle the perfect Russian AK available in the market, Arsenal, Inc. has taken all the necessary steps to ensure all the components and features are true to its original configuration. The receiver of SGL21 rifle has the proper markings on both sides without any extra commercial markings including the legendary Izhmash Factory logo, the upward pointing arrow in triangle.

On the right side, it has correctly positioned notches for the safety lever, marked with letters “S” and “F” and no additional openings at the bottom forward portion of the receiver. The components and features on the new SGL21 rifle resemble true Russian AK rifle, including the safety lever with correct shape and properly positioned dimple, the correct trigger guard with magazine catch and the correct bullet guide enabling SGL21 to accept any standard AK magazine, the 1000 meter rear sight leaf, the highest quality Arsenal, Inc. double stage fire control group (hammer, trigger and disconnector), original Arsenal, Inc. mil-spec polymer furniture, including the handguards, pistol grip, and the original Warsaw pact length buttstock, the retainer for lower handguard, the correct gas tube, original gas block with the correct vent holes, a guide hole for the cleaning rod and accessory lug, correct AK-74 type front sight block with 24x1.5mm right-hand threads and bayonet lug."

The frame has an integral MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. The single-piece captive recoil spring assembly simplifies the assembly and disassembly process and minimizes the possibility of spring loss. An internal recoil buffer increases service life by reducing stress on the receiver created by the more powerful .40 S&W caliber ammunition. The trigger guard is rounded to conform with current pistol gripping practices. Three 12-round magazines are included.Looking for 9mm, Beretta cx4, Rossi circuit judge 44 mag, ruger sp9, marlin lever actions in hangun rounds, ruger vaquero in 45lc/45acp, or maybe something else.

If imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, then the Tristar T-120 fits that description to a T. This is basically a more streamlined version of a CZ, and many CZ parts will actually work on this pistol, including, but not limited to grips or mags. Moreover, even with a rail like the SP-01, the T-120 is actually much lighter.   This pistol was purchased new, and I've never fired it. Only thing I did was to put on CZ custom grips. It comes with original box, 2 mags and all the accessories that were part of the package.***NO TRADES***  I prefer to DROS at Bain & Davis/Oscar Gun Works & Alamo Pawn during a weekend morning. Turners West Covina & Pasadena are reserved as last reports. DROS by early weekend mornings is preferred. *** PLEASE LEAVE NUMBER FOR TEXT/CONTACT.

This is one of those pistols that make you seem like a better shooter than you really are. The action is butter smooth and much of the recoil is taken up by the frame so you can be back on target faster. I've got three Sigs (1 other MK25 in Black) and will always be a Sig guy from now on.If you've been wanting one of these, but put it off because of the price, now's your time to get one under retail.Comes with the box, all paperwork, NSWG Certificate of Authenticity, pistol, and three 15 round magazines.Asking $950 cash or $1,025 trade value.Features:Caliber: 9mmAction Type: DA/SATrigger Pull: DA 10.0 lbsTrigger Pull: SA 4.4 lbsOverall Length: 7.7 inOverall Height: 5.5 inOverall Width: 1.5 inBarrel Length: 4.4 inSight Radius: 6.3 inWeight w/Mag: 34.4 ozMag Capacity: 15 RoundsSights: SIGLITE® Night SightsGrips: Black Polymer Factory GripsFrame Finish: Flat Dark EarthSlide Finish: Nitron®Accessory Rail: YesFeatures UID identification label, anti-corrosion coatings on controls and internal components, anchor engraving."

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. The Blackwood features a natural stainless steel slide and black hard coat anodized alloy frame, paired with Hogue Blackwood grips."

It has a Magpul vertical grip, Magpul handguard, one magazine, NC star red dot sight, and a condor rifle case. It's also got a transferrable gander mt. warranty with it. From what I've been told Ruger has excellent customer service as well and usually does repairs without question, but I bought it anyways. I've only fired approximately 300 rounds through this gun in the few short weeks that I've owned it. I'd prefer to sell to someone who has a CWP, and who doesn't mind signing a bill of sale.
