Development of the Type 94 pistol began in 1929, and after several redesigns the final prototype was tested and officially adopted by the Japanese Army in late 1934 (Japanese calendar, 2594). The Type 94 pistol entered production in 1935. Approximately 71,000 pistols were manufactured before production ended in 1945. The Type 94 pistol was designed for, and popular among, Japanese tank and aircraft crews who preferred a smaller, lightweight design. Japanese weapons experts have subsequently criticized some design elements of the Type 94; in particular the pistol could be fired unintentionally before the breech was fully locked if the sear bar on the side of the receiver was jarred loose and the pistol was improperly handled. Additionally, the process to disassemble the pistol is overly complex and awkward. The build quality of the Type 94 pistol declined over its production run; ""last ditch"" pistols made in 1945 were crudely manufactured. The Type 94 pistol is operated by a different mechanism than previous Japanese sidearms. Unlike previously designed Nambu pistols, the Type 94 operates with a concealed hammer and with a firing pin rather than a hammer. According to authors, Harry L. Derby and James D. Brown, the firing pin is inherently weak and is prone to breakage because of a recess cut provided for the crossbolt and is prone to breaking at this point. The sturdier hammer firing mechanism was developed and included in the Type 94 to replace the poor striker on the Type 14 Nambu. The locking system is a rising-block type which floats independently between the lugs underneath the chamber end of the barrel. The single coil mainspring is positioned around the barrel instead of to the rear of the barrel as found on other Nambu pistols. The grip is smaller than other Japanese pistols and is finished with smooth wood but according to author Jeff Kinard, are more comfortable for use by men with smaller hands. The magazine holds a maximum of six rounds because of the smaller grip and it is considered difficult to reload the weapon, with pressure from the bolt holding it inside the pistol. The magazine catch protrudes far enough to occasionally disengage when the pistol is placed on its left side on a hard surface. The magazine could also disengage if squeezed into or jarred in a holster.  The manual safety lever is located on the left rear of the frame and has the kanji for fire and safe stamped onto the frame. The front blade sight on the muzzle of the Type 94 pistol and the rear fixed V were occasionally inaccurately positioned making them useless when the weapon is being aimed. The rear sight was reduced from a U-shape to a simple notch in 1944 with the front blade being left unchanged but less attention to detail being applied as World War II progressed. Very few of there were produce in comparison of other handguns the Japinese made. During the last month of production only 34 were made. This one was made in that last month June 1945 just 2 months before the end of WWII In 1945 approximately 7108 guns were produced making up only 2.5% of all type 94s. produced in the 8th rarest year of production out of 20 Essentially all Type 94s were made by the private firm Chuo Kogyo (or its predecessor, the Nambu Gun Mfg. Company) at their Kokubunji factory under Nagoya Arsenal supervision. This firearm is in moderate shape, with finish wear, crude machining marks.   Bore is in good shape clean and shiny, CHambered in 8mm,  this is a fascinating piece of WWII history and is an excellent piece to any collection"

The M&P (Military & Police) became Model 10's in 1958 when S&W started the numerical designations, but they are identical guns. I've looked into it, and the serial number (C380,000 range) dates this as being made in 1956, and shipping in late '56, or very early '57.I got this recently just because it's cool and I got a deal on it, from a guy that inherited several revolvers, but ain't revolver guy. Condition-wise, it's not a pristine, collector-grade, safe queen, but it's a very decent ""shooters grade"" pistol, with the typical ""honest wear"" you'd expect from a blued duty pistol that's 6 decades old, but overall, I'd say it looks pretty damned good!Lock-up is fine ( the slight play which is typical for a S&W), the bore is crisp and clean, and the flame cutting under the top strap is only superficial, indicating a fairly modest round count.It's got a 4"" barrel, fixed sights, and is a round-butt K-frame, which are considerably less common than square butts ( not necessarilly more valuable or desirable, but does make them a little less bulky to tote).The grips are after-market Rogers combat grips ( ebay is full of S&W round-butt magnas for only $29, but they're not as ergonomic as these).I've played with it a little, and it shoots straight and 100% reliably, but now I'm already bored and thinking about something else. You know how that goes!Trade interests include.......well.....I dunno. Surprise me. But, I'm not dying to let it go, just goofing around to see if something else cool pops up. Any absurdly low-ball offers will just be ignored, as will anything that feels like another phishing scammer from Nigeria. If the ad is still up, then I still have it.Thanks for looking........"

This has the detachable box magazine and is pre accutrigger, which I'd much rather prefer for a quick handling scout rifle. The trigger is very crisp. Has the oversized tactical bolt knob. Also has the scout peep sight and scope rail included, but not attached. Finally, including a box of Remington 140 Grain PSP ammo, the same ammo and lot number used to sight in the rifle, which was last shot in 2013 and been storage ever since in a hard case. As you can tell by the target at 100 yards, this gun is very accurate. MOA. The older and well made Simmons Aetec scope is a 2.5x10 ($170 new back then), Plex reticle, and has crystal clear optics with a wide field of view and good low light gathering. The bases are Weavers, and the rings are quality extended Millets. Nice scope\base\ring setup. Also includes Butler Creek scope caps. This has been a wonderful scope and gun and the gun holds zero year after year as I never ever had to adjust it since the inital sighting in. Also includes a hard case (actual case not shown)$500 FTF or will ship for an extra $35 CONUS. NO TRADES PLEASE.Thanks."

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism."

I have a Marlin Model 60sb that I have completely cleaned and restored. It's been completely disassembled for about a year and today when I finally sat down to reassemble it, a part that was under spring tension flew off somewhere in my garage and of course, being my luck, the part is no bigger than a pinky nail. Needless to say I searched for several hours before counting my losses. I have every other part needed to finish the project and there are several videos online that can help you reassemble (it's not that difficult). If interested..email me. I will include a picture of the needed part in the post as well. I will trade for a Mossberg 88 stock or other 88/500 parts.Unless you want to offer something different. I'm not asking for anything special given the circumstances.In the picture I posted..the part needed for the Hammer Assembly is the square piece at the end of the spring."

$275.00, reasonable offers considered. No Trades, Cash Only. Like New Condition. Comes with everything in the picture (not the coffee maker…): night vision scope, tools, IR illuminator, owners manual, carry bag. As you can see I still have the original wrapping that I keep it in. I put about 3 rounds through it to sight it in on a AR15 556 with a 20” bull barrel, took it out into the field a few times for hog hunting but never got lucky enough to have a hog come around.
