Made primarily in the 1980's to the early 90's, the Model 681 was used by many police departments throughout the U.S. and remains a fairly sought-after revolver to this day.  This revolver has been very well maintained and cleaned after every use.  This revolver will come with two speed loaders and i have a quantity of 357 and 38 amo that would be availalbe for purchase at a greatly reduced rate if the buyer of the revolver wishes."

The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. With choices from 2"" to 6"" barrel lengths and sight options, the Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to repare to fire. 

I have used this revolver several times and it is fun to shoot and shoots well. It has been well maintained and in new condition. Only reason I am selling is to downsize."

It is designed for maximum operational functionality in the smallest, most robust package. The DBAL-A3 features a focusable Class IIIR <4mW infrared illuminator, Class1 (0.7mW) infrared pointer, and a visible green pointer. The visible and IR lasers are co-aligned, making zeroing procedures a snap. Zeroing one, will zero the other to the same POI, letting the operator zero the laser during the day and conduct quick checks to confirm.The DBAL-A3 features the latest technology from Steiner. The IR illuminator features a high/low setting and can be focused. It is laser-based, so it does not produce a large downrange signature found in LED IR Illuminators. It is good out to about <200 meters. So while shorter range than LED’s, it is certainly more covert. The visible laser has been upgraded to a Green pointer. Green lasers allow for faster target acquisition at longer distances during daylight because the human eye can see five times more shades of green than red. Visible lasers are great for use with SCBA equipment when the operator cannot always achieve a proper cheek weld with the weapon. The visible red laser version is still available on request.The DBAL-A3 provides the same overall functionality as its predecessor. Enhancements include dual remote cable ports that allow a Steiner Tactical Light to be plugged directly into the unit. by plugging the supplied Y-cable into both the light and the visible override port on the back of the laser housing. Pressing the Y-cable pressure pad will simultaneously activate the tactical and the visible laser. The second pressure pad, plugged into the standard port, will activate the infrared laser functions. This unique feature allows for immediate transition from low light to daylight operations by simply choosing which pressure pad to activate.All ITAR restrictions apply.Manufacturer:SteinerSteiner:3.4″(L) x 2.9″(W) x 1.9″(H)Weight:8.2 oz. w/ BatteryHousing:Aircraft Aluminum 6061T-6Power:One (1) 3V DL123 BatteryBattery Life:3 Hours ContinuousWaterproof:3 MetersWarranty:1 Year WarrantyIR Laser Spec:—————————————————-IR Pointer Class:Class 1IR Pointer Output:<0.7mW (High), <0.2mW (Low)IR Pointer Divergence:<0.8mRadIR Pointer Wavelength:850nmIR Pointer Range:400 MetersVisible Laser Spec:—————————————————-Visible Pointer Class:IIIR (Green)Visible Pointer Output:<5mW (High), <1mW (Low)Visible Pointer Divergence:<0.8mRadVisible Pointer Wavelength:532nmVisible Pointer Range:750 Meters (High), 15 Meters (Low)IR Illuminator Spec:—————————————————-IR Illuminator Class:IIIRIR Illuminator Output:<4mW (High), <2mW (Low)IR Illuminator Divergence:~95 – 195mRadIR Illuminator Wavelength:835nmIR Illuminator Range:<200 MetersINCLUDES:Quick Release Throw Lever Mount, 7″ Remote Cable Pressure Pad Switch, Nylon Pouch, Allen Wrench, Operator’s Manual, One (1) 3V DL123 BatterySteiner P/N:9008 (black), 9009 (tan)"

I have put 40-50 rounds through it and it shoots as true and straight as Ruger says it does. The muzzles brake that came on the gen 2's really take all the kick away. This gun kicks like a 223.  I have 1-2 boxes of Hornady ammo left. I have a Viper vortex 4-16 scope on the rifle sighted in at 200 yards. I also have a green light attachment for coyote and hog hunting that works great. I have bought the proper attachments to add a bi pod on the front that is included. The gun is basically brand new and I still have the box for the rifle and for the scope. The gen 2 last time I checked is on 14 month back order at Ruger. I am listing to sell only because I do not shoot as far as this gun is capable of shooting and also the gun is heavy for the type on hunting and hiking I do while hunting. By far my favorite gun I have shot and owned. Any questions feel free to text or call me anytime. The price is firm for the most part but I may be able to drop it a little pit if there isn't many offers for the first month or two. REDACTED -JonHave a blessed holiday season everyone.

The bluing on the Rifle is excellent as well with the only imperfection being under the rear sight. There is a small amount of rust under the sight shown in the picture. The sight could be removed and the rust cleaned up but I want to leave the Rifle in its original condition for the buyer. Because of this imperfection I have to rate the bluing at 95% however if this were not there it would easily be 99%. The action is nice and smooth and operates flawlessly. There are scope rings currently attached to the rifle however I do have the original plug bolts if you wish to take the scope rings off and turn this back into an Iron sight Rifle. I also have the original manual/parts list for the Rifle. This is one of the good old Marlin’s not one of the new Remlin’s. *Please note that I will only sell through a reputable FFL with a license number that I can verify.

The RFB uses metric FAL magazines,which insert straight into the magazine well and do not need to rock into place. It has a short-stroke gas piston operating system.The rifle uses a patented forward-ejection system via a tube placed over the barrel that ejects the spent case forwards, over the handguard of the rifle. Extraction is accomplished by two extractors, each with two axis of rotation. The extractors may move side-to-side to engage the rim of the case, and pivot upwards to extract the spent case after firing. Empty cases remain in the ejection chute until either the weapon is tilted downwards, the charging handle is operated, or they are pushed out by following cases. Cases drop gently from this chute to the left of the barrel. To avoid sloppy trigger pull typical of firearms modified into bullpups, the RFB uses a floating linkage bar between the sear and the hammer, allowing the sear to remain above the trigger.The weapon is fully ambidextrous,much in the style of the Belgian F2000 rifle. The RFB is delivered without iron sights. A mil-spec Picatinny rail is provided for mounting a wide range of optics and tactical accessories. The barrel of the RFB is not fully free floated, it instead serves as the rigid ""spine"" of the weapon, to which all other components are attached (either directly or through other components). Meanwhile, Kel-Tec has prepared similar bullpup rifles in 5.56mm called the RDB"

This guy Bobby Waites contacted me and gave me some sob story about having cancer and that he could only pay $200 for a gun I had for sale on here. I tried calling him and he sent me a picture of a person with a throat tube and said he can't talk due to cancer and wouldnt answer his phone. By text we set up to meet off JTB and Hodges but he then no showed and later that night he text me saying he still wanted it and could only do $180 on it. He said he wanted to buy it for his son since he may die soon. I felt bad for him and agreed to meet him today at Merrill Road and I-95I waited and waited and I was texting him and he kept saying he was stuck in traffic but he was ""getting close."" About 30 min goes by and I leave. Before I left I called and text him WITH NO RESPONSE! On the way home just to get him to respond I told him I needed the money and I would sell it for $100. He then wanted me to come to his home and gave me an address at 43043 Thomas Creek Road in Callahan, Florida. Considering I didn't want to die,  I obviously didn't do that. He then claimed he feels weird in buying guns and that he didn't want to get robbed. I told him that he doesn't need to use this site if he is a paranoid type person. I have all the text if anyone wants to read them and as always, BE SAFE! This world is full of crazies!

All reasonable offers will be considered. I strongly prefer to trade the rifle and ammunition (see FAQ) I have for it together. Very good condition Yugo 24/47 Mauser chambered in 8mm Mauser. This rifle has a M48 barrel with a 98k style front sight with hood. Like most 24/47s, this rifle does not have matching serials. The stock has a stamped serial that matches the receiver. All other parts on this rifle are non-matching, though functional. This rifle's bolt is blued, unlike the far more common 'in-the-white' steel. FAQ: Ammo?I would prefer to trade both the rifle and the ammunition I have with it together, and not as seperate items. I have 180 rounds of M75 Yugo surplus in an unopened container. It is 196gr brass case dated around the late 90s. Non-magnetic and Berdan primed. You should always assume surplus 8mm is corrosive, so treat it as such. Anything wrong with the rifle?There is wear on the rear of the receiver (see the second picture). The rifle has typical wear from use as a military rifle, but is otherwise in very good condition. Other pictures available upon request. How can I get in contact with you?You can use the contact system here on Armslist I will try to get back to you as quickly as I am able to. Will you trade?I will not trade rifles for this rifle. I might consider pistols, depending on type and condition. Cash is preferred. Misc:I will not ship the rifle. We will have to meet face to face. I live in Greenville, and while I am willing to travel a reasonable distance, don't purchase the rifle unless you are willing to pick it up. Please have a valid Texas driver's license or carry permit. If you are from a state other than Texas, a carry permit from your state would be fine. We will fill out a bill of sale at the time of purchase. If the ad is still up, the rifle is still for sale. No need to ask."

Experience one of the most innovative developments in modern firearms technology with the patented KRISS Vector Platform. At the heart of each Vector is the Super V Recoil Mitigation System. This unique operating system redirects energy down, and away from the shooter, which eliminates felt recoil and muzzle climb.


The KRISS Vector GEN II is the next evolution of the Vector platform, taking it from a firearm into a multi-caliber weapon system. Chambered in .45ACP and 9mm, the KRISS Vector is compatible with the ubiquitous Glock magazine. Changing between calibers can be done in seconds, without any tools. The KRISS Vector GEN II is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip.


The KRISS Vector CRB is the non-NFA, semi-automatic, carbine variant with a 16Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¢Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¯Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¿Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¯Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¿Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â½ barrel.

A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers. Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls. The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol. P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode —and have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame —in addition to the two safety levers. A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber. Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions. During a 2010 endurance test, a randomly selected P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures. P30 and P30S models are available in 9 mm and .40 S&W.           Key Features:  Special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail on frame for mounting lights and accessories Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life Multiple trigger firing modes available Patented HK recoil reduction system One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel Corrosion resistant “hostile environment” blued finish Ambidextrous slide levers and Ambidextrous magazine release magazine Patented lock-out safety device Bobbed hammer (LEM models) Spurred hammer (DA/SA models) Automatic hammer and firing pin safeties Ambidextrous safety levers (P30S model)"

I love this rifle dearly but I can't afford the cost of .308/7.62x51 on my current salary. Ive owned the rifle for about 2 months but with an emergency coming up in my family (and the cost of ammo), I need to part ways with it. This rifle will feed just about anything you put in it but it does mangle brass with the chamber flutes so reloading isn't necessarily an option. Ive only been about 120 rounds through it so PTR doesn't even consider it broken in yet. It comes with 40 rounds of federal 308, 180 rounds of Aguilla 7.62x51, and 40 rounds of Tula (not pictured). I will not consider trades and I am pretty firm on the price. These rifle generally go for $1000-$1200 new and there isn't many vendors in Oregon that sell PTR rifles. On top of that, good luck picking up one of these rifles with a case, 4 magazines, and 260 rounds for $1200 in like-new condition."

I've taken off the A2 furniture and have put on a Magpul ACS stock, a AAC Blackout flash hider, and the golden jewel, a Geissele National Match trigger with a pull right around 2.5lbs. Also included is two windowed twenty-five round black PMAGs, and the rail accessory kit which includes: two 3"" rails, and a 1.5"" QD mounting point. It has a little under 300 mild handloads through it with great care taken to the bore. There's a few light scratches on the rail, but nothing deep or outstanding. I've shot 1.5"" groups with 147 grain and 168 grain handloads off of a bag at 100 yards, but I suspect a bipod and rear bag or leadsled would really cut those groups down. This is really just a great all-around battle rifle, and is really fun to run around with being a light rifle. I am willing to travel around Washington state to meet you, and willing to ship to your FFL. I am interested in high end firearms like SCAR 17, precision bolts guns, or whatever+cash! Thank you for looking! $2,800 - LWRC REPR$240 - Geissele National MatchYours for $2,500 OBO!"
