The open-end, 3-prong design of the Blackout is inherently stronger than 4-prong units, and is not subject to the wear and erosion commonly encountered with closed-end designs. All Blackout flash suppressors are machined from high strength aerospace steel alloy and coated in a hard, durable, corrosion resistant SCARmor finish. This 51T Blackout flash hider works in conjunction with AAC's improved ratchet mount sound suppressors. The 51-T mount is an intuitive, lightning fast silencer attachment/detachment system that allows for secure installation of a suppressor in less than 3 seconds with no tools or moving parts. Not compatible with the older spring mount (18-Tooth) or newer ratchet taper mount (90-Tooth) sound suppressors.

It comes with all of the factory documentation, plus the additional test target from its trip back to WC.   It also comes with the factory range bag, six WC magazines and one Chip McCormick Power Mag.  I am also including a CrossBreed , right-hand, SuperTuck holster.  It is custom made and there is a waiting list to get one, this one took just a little over a month.
I am asking $2,600.  I would like to do a cash transaction, in person.  I would also consider a partial trade for a nice carry piece, chambered in 9mm.  I am looking for a S&W Shield, but would consider other options.  Yes, I do have a concealed carry license.
If you are interested, have any additional questions, or would like some additional photos, just let me know.

It comes equipped with Wilson Combat sights, which now include an all new gold bead front. In addition, Larry Vickers again taps Tango Down to produce the extended mag release, slide catch, magazine base plates, grip plug with integral disassembly tool and allen wrench for rear sight adjustment.  This new Vickers Tactical GLOCK bolsters the tactical color triangle with some added extras. Larry Vickers had this to say about this latest venture, “The most requested color for the Vickers GLOCKs is black by a wide margin. After careful consideration, we decided to mount a gold bead front sight with an otherwise black pistol. The combination is striking to say the least.”  This third rendition of the Exclusive Vickers GLOCKs continues to be the the centerpiece of tactical offerings. Vice President and Product Development Manager Jason Cloessner was as eager to add classic black to the fold. “The LAV GLOCK series is one of our most requested products. Adding classic black to the lineup greatly enhanced the tactical color options that the Vickers GLOCK community was more than ready to support.”"

I have a ESP LTD electric guitar, it's the Kirk Hammett/Metallica's signature edition model KH-202. Very nice guitar, killer tone and made for shredding! Has EMG active pickups, thin neck with 24 jumbo frets and Floyd rose locking tremolo system. If you want all the specs just go to Musicians friend. Overall killer guitar for the money, sells new for $499 pretty much everywhere I look. Also other than your normal light picking surface scratches this guitar is in excellent condition and play great! Just selling guitar only, no case. So if you have a gun that's worth anywhere between $200-$350 and wanting to trade call or text me at REDACTED. Also I do have my CPL and and Pistol sales record(RI-60) ready to go. Thanks for looking."

Really sweet shooter, and runs like a champ! Excellent range and carry gun! The slight bobbed grip really takes any bite out of bigger hands when shooting this gun, it also makes it print less dramatically while carrying...Only slight imperfection is where the sights were installed with a steel punch and show some marks (only on the right side of the sights themselves) from being drifted, other than that you could always put white dot novaks back on if it really bothered you. You don't find these stainless guns with trijicon night sights very often!!!"

If you research the internet for the real thing, not some photocopy and if you can even find a GP lithograph under #500 your not going to touch this for anything less than $350 and that is the print alone. I purchased this along with 3 other pieces before Thomas Kinkade passed away from one of his Galleries in California. The one thing that lets the buyer know that the Gallery Proof is the real thing is the little gold emblem that is on each Gallery Proof that is made. These emblems very per piece and usually have some significant to his family of something in the painting. My wife and I had this professionally streached & framed by Hobby Lobby and spared no expense having this done. We ordered custom glass that protects the art from UV light and kept with Thomas Kinkades frame style with real wood and his triple matting that his framed art is known for. We also has a custom metal tag with the art piece title included when the framing was done.  The price I am asking will basically cover the cost of the frame. Unfortunate times force some of us to have to get rid of things in order to get buy and my hope is that this will make someone very happy and allow them to enjoy a real nice piece from his work. This Gallery Proof only came in 16x12 and hence, with the frame, the piece is much larger. The picture I am posting in this post is of the same titled piece of work that I am selling framed. I will be more than happy to send you some pictures of the actual art once we have made contact with one another via email/phone. Just a little (FYI) Lilac Gazebo was release by Kinkade in 1996 and to this day is rated as one of the top 10 most sought after pieces people want. Please feel free to contact me via phone call at (765 two-seven- four 5056) at any time. I live close to Highway 69 and the closest exit to me is exit 214 Lapel Indiana. I have no problem meeting someone within reason. Public places such as a gas station, place to eat, etc.. off an exit seems to be a good meeting place or if you would like to view this at my location we can set up a time without a problem. I would also encourage you to call around to some of the local Thomas Kinkade Galleries and ask them what this particular piece is worth. If you do, be sure to include the fact that it is a G/P along with the # edition etc. I look forward to meeting with whoever becomes the new owner of this as I know you will enjoy it. If you are looking for something a bit larger, we are considering selling our largest peice which is 32''x40'' and is a canvas GP ""Rose Garden.....This one however needs it's own wall, if you are interested in this one, please drop me a line and let me know. Thanks to all who look and consider. With Christmas on it's way very close, this will make a wonderful gift. A last bit of information, we do have an actual Thomas Kinkade Gallary in Zionsille Indiana if anyone would like to contact them for info, value, price etc....."
