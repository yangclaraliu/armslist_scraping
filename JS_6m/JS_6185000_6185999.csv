269,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6185269,"For Sale:  3-PDR Field Cannon (Yes, you read correctly, cannon)","NE, Portland, Oregon","$ 5,500","Listed On: Monday, December 5, 2016",Muzzle,no type,no type,no type,Muzzle Loader,"For sale (though I don't want to sell it) is my 3-PDR M1832 Field Gun. Almost identical to its larger cousin, the M1841 6-PDR. But, to give you a sense of weight difference:
 
3-PDR Barrel: 310lb
6-PDR Barrel: 1,225lb
 
Needless to say if you're getting into cannons, this one is easy enough for a two man crew to move and operate, and is small enough to fit in any garage corner.
 
It is all brand-new, never-fired. Barrel is high grade iron with a steel liner and breech. The steel liner means that this gun has NO life expectancy. In other words, an original cannon from antiquity can probably shoot 10,000 rounds before bursting, or otherwise becoming dangerous to operate. A steel lined barrel? Keep it clean, and you can shoot it for 1,000 years with no issue. Black powder isn't strong enough to harm the high-grade steel used. As such, this is a lifelong investment that will only increase in price as the years go by. Not to mention the sheer joy of watching your buddies drool over the only artillery piece they've ever laid hands on (if you'lll let them touch your new safe queen, that is!).
 
The carriage is absolutely beautiful. Created here locally by a master craftsman, out of hand-hammered iron and white oak. It will last as long as your barrel if you keep care of it. All the tools except a water bucket (you would not BELIEVE how hard it is to make one of those that doesn't leak!) are included, and I will happily instruct you on proper use and safety of a cannon.
 
Remember before you contact me. Cannons are artillery, not firearms. If you think of this like ""just a big shotgun"", you might end up losing a limb. And you'd deserve it, for disrespecting the absolute killing power of an artillery piece. This is not a display piece, a toy, or something you should buy on a whim. This is not for everyone and will require support and maintanence. That said, there's nothing that turns heads faster on a gun range than rolling up a 550lb cannon to blast apart an unsuspecting pumpkin.
 
I can teach you how to make any kind of shot. Canister, roundball, sabot, chainshot, hotshot....there are dozens of types, all equally fun.
 
 
Price is absolutely firm, I will not wiggle an inch. This thing cost me $6,000 to create, and it is unfired, stored indoors. Tools included, barrel included, premium quality carriage that was handmade.... I'm even throwing in 100 cannonballs for free. The ONLY reason I am selling; I have two, and I cannot find a good reason to tell my girl why I need both.
 
 
Email me anytime, happy to answer any questions, I am not a photographer so please excuse the rather basic pictures.
 
I can strip the paint if you need and repaint to any color under the sun. I use only premium brand-name outdoor paints and glosses.
 
 
Shipping can be arranged to anywhere in the world, and it is at-cost. Typically about $600 to get it anywhere in the USA, but that changes on a number of factors. Just email me if you have questions. I live in Portland, OR, and I'm fine if you want to physically come pick it up."

This gun was manufactured in 1907 by Springfield Armory. The barrel has a date of 11-18, and from RIA.
I do not know how well it shoots, since low serial numbered 1903's are considered unsafe to shoot, but the bolt functions very smoothly, and the wood is in great condition.
I can't find many markings on the stock or bolt, so I am not sure if they are matching to the receiver. I have a few rounds of 30-06 I will throw in as well.
Asking $500.

The Chiappa Model 911 is a rimfire replica of the most well-known firearm designed by John Browning. The original M1911 was a single-action, semiautomaticpistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. It was the standard-issue side arm for the United States armed forces from 1911 to 1985, and is still carried by some U.S. forces. In total, the United States procured around 2.7 million M1911s and M1911A1 pistols during its service life. The Chiappa Model 1911-22 features the same weight, and handling characteristics of the original 1911, however, we have redesigned the action utilizing a fixed barrel design yielding very high accuracy at an affordable price. (Less money than most 1911 rimfire conversion kits). The Chiappa 1911 is constructed from Chiappalloy* & steel components featuring wooden two piece grips. With both standard and target models available, it is the natural choice for semi-auto plinking, target shooting, and affordable handgun fun."

Designed to be the favored back up or last resort option for both civilian and law enforcement use, this subcompact slimline design is the perfectly balanced answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It is ultra-concealable, accurate and comfortable for all shooters regardless of hand size. When it comes to size and comfort, the all new G43 provides the best of both worlds. Typically, with handguns of this dimension, the design of the pistol does a poor job of resolving issues concerning felt recoil. This can cause discomfort for shooters who are not familiar with shooting smaller framed pistols. Seasoned shooters are familiar with this and adjust their grip, but have to work harder to keep the pistol on target for follow-up shots. The design of the new G43 allow for a more comfortable and confident shooting experience for all types of users."

This is a United States Firearms Mfg Co (U.S.F.A.) Single Action Army ""Pre-War"" revolver. Many people believe these are the finest SAA's ever made...better even than Colt! Made in Hartford, Connecticut, U.S.A., the fit, finish, and attention to detail on the USFA revolvers is exceptional. This revolver is chambered for the .44 Special cartridge and wears a 4-3/4"" barrel. These were finished at Turnbull's and this beauty has the bright blue finish with color case hardened frame and hammer. This ""Pre-War"" model was supposed to be the most technically accurate version of the pre-WWII Colt Single Action available, but sadly USFA quit building their beautiful single actions a few years ago and they have gained ""collector status"". This revolver is in very good condition but has been fired (the owner had the audacity to actually use it!!) and shows some wear. There are a few handling marks, a couple of cylinder rotation marks, and a few scattered light freckles including a couple tiny pits in one spot on the cylinder. The case colors are still vivid and the blue finish is still quite nice. I'd grade this revolver about 95% overall and it looks better in real life than in the photos. The ""U.S."" marked hard rubber grips are in excellent shape, free of cracks or chips. This revolver is in excellent mechanical condition with good timing and solid lock-up. The bore is excellent as well. It would appear this revolver was carried a little and shot less. It comes in the original factory box with owner's manual, miscellaneous paperwork, and gun sock. A very high quality revolver that will make someone an outstanding shooter!Buyer pays $20.00 shipping."

This is a United States Firearms Mfg Co (U.S.F.A.) Single Action Army ""Pre-War"" revolver. Many people believe these are the finest SAA's ever made...better even than Colt! Made in Hartford, Connecticut, U.S.A., the fit, finish, and attention to detail on the USFA revolvers is exceptional. This revolver is chambered for the .44 Special cartridge and wears a 4-3/4"" barrel. These were finished at Turnbull's and this beauty has the bright blue finish with color case hardened frame and hammer. This ""Pre-War"" model was supposed to be the most technically accurate version of the pre-WWII Colt Single Action available, but sadly USFA quit building their beautiful single actions a few years ago and they have gained ""collector status"". This revolver is in very good condition but has been fired (the owner had the audacity to actually use it!!) and shows some wear. There are a few handling marks, a couple of cylinder rotation marks, and a few scattered light freckles including a couple tiny pits in one spot on the cylinder. The case colors are still vivid and the blue finish is still quite nice. I'd grade this revolver about 95% overall and it looks better in real life than in the photos. The ""U.S."" marked hard rubber grips are in excellent shape, free of cracks or chips. This revolver is in excellent mechanical condition with good timing and solid lock-up. The bore is excellent as well. It would appear this revolver was carried a little and shot less. It comes in the original factory box with owner's manual, miscellaneous paperwork, and gun sock. A very high quality revolver that will make someone an outstanding shooter!Buyer pays $20.00 shipping."
