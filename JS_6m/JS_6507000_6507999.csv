The weapon has been well maintained with less than 250 rounds through it and haven't experienced any malfunctions. It comes with a padded hard case with multiple spots for locks, and a GI mag with a Magpul follower inside of it. It has an intergrated rail ontop and is optics ready. Comes factory with a carbon fiber upper and lower reciever (which is stronger and lighter than most steel/aluminum factory recievers) chrome lined barrel chambered in 5.56/2.23, gas block w/ rail section, and the fire control group is Mil-Spec. It shoots really well and was surpised on how precise it was out of the box. Unfortunately, I need the money due to some medical bills, and can't move much on price. Paid almost 700 for it after taxes and background check at Bass Pro back in September. There are minor scratches on barrel from laying it on a bench at the range, should be easy to cover up. Located in Carrollwood in Tampa. Feel free to text me anytime! 321 four three two 4202 (no calls please) Thank you! -Daniel"

Pmag.  This is a new unfired rifle that I never got around to doing anything with because of other projects.  I chose this particular AR-10 because I wanted a bit more range than a 16"" barrel would give and the medium contour barrel keeps the rifle as light as possible without compromising accuracy.  After looking over lots of ballistic data I saw no reason to go with a 20"" barrel, IMO the gain in velocity was simply not worth the extra length and weight.  Again, the rifle is new but it was purchased around three years ago, the only one I could find currently listed was one on Gunbroker for $1,650 in the same stock configuration.  I do have aftermarket pistol grips and stocks I can add for a little extra, just let me know.
$1,300 firm in cash or better in trade, not going to straight trade on something I can buy for hundreds less, sorry.  This one cost well over $1,500 after tax and it's still new.  
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and shorter in 9mm and .45 ACP and cash or??  If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.  If you don't mention cash or other either way, I will assume you want a straight trade.  
Must be able to own a firearm in TX.  I can ship insured to another TX resident for $30 more.
Thanks for looking!"
