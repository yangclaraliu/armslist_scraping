It's seen about 1k rounds in another gun. Upper is Hardened Arms 7.5"", lower is a Karri's Guns (registered as a pistol) and the BCG is a DPMS off of a 3G2. Gun itself has >50 rds through it. AFG is included but the optic is an extra $125. It is a Holosun 2MOA. It's also nearly new, however, the front lens cover snapped off when I opened it so it could use a new one. Still attaches in place but no longer flips open. The gun shoots great for what little I've used it. Only trade I'll consider is a Gen 4 Glock 26. Please only contact me if you are a serious cash buyer or have a G26. Thanks"

The stock is walnut with some nice figure and is checkered. The barrel has a single bead with a Cutts compensator and Lyman modified choke tube. The compensator cuts the recoil in half and your shoulder feels a heck of a lot better after a round of skeet. Bluing is in good condition. Overall barrel length is 28” and the bore is clean and bright. It has a dial-o-matic vent cap to switch between heavy or light loads. It also has a cross-bolt safety. I've shot several boxes of shells through it without any issues. Shoots 2 1/2” & 2 3/4” shells. It doesn't appear to have been shot to much. The stock finish is thin in several spots but the stock doesn't have any major dings or gouges. If you refinished the stock, the gun would look like new.  Not looking for any trades at the moment."

Gun is still LNIB AND UNFIRED.Looking to trade for a similar M77 in 22-250 in same condition and value.This rifle has remained unfired since leaving the factory. I'm listing it as used because it WAS previously sold at retail. I bought this from the original owner who stated he never fired it. Rings are still in package and the bolt looks new. The box did not fare as well from storage as the rifle which is immaculate. There are a couple of minor handling marks in the bright ss finish on the barrel. My experience in the past with these SS Rugers is minor scratches or marks can be polished out with little effort but I'll leave that up to you. The skeleton stock is in great condition with just a couple of very minor scuffs from safe storage. When I first bought the gun there was one very small area of surface rust[1/16""] just ahead of the receiver. The rust wiped right off of the SS but left a very minor dark spot. I tried to capture it in the photos but it is hard with the flash and the SS finish. Again it may polish out with little effort but I'll leave that up to the new owner. It is hardly noticeable in person or in the pictures but I am an OCD stickler when it comes to condition so I like to point out EVERYTHING I see no matter how small or minor it may be. There is nothing worse for me than surprises on your end of the deal. Strong bright bore."

The gun has the full magazine tube so will hold 9 shots. Just to remind you, this is a 12 guage (2-3/4”) semi-automatic and manual (pump) shotgun. The barrel is 21 ½” long and the gun will hold 8 shells plus one in the chamber. The original finish is parkerized with the receiver and barrel being black, and the ventilated forearm area being the factor grey-dark olive.

This is a Rock Island MS, Bull Barrel, with a reverse plug.  I have both tested the lockup with gauges, and test fired the pistol. It's in excellent working condition. 
I've put a pair of old colt grips on it, as the original grips were missing.  It appears that some parts are either stainless, or in the raw.  Someone looking to customize a pistol might like this piece, as there are no ball cuts on the front of the slide, and there are no makers engravings on the slide.  Includes a single Wilson Combat 8rd. mag, and the factory case and accessories.
I own a few 1911's, and I feel that 450.00 is a very fair price for this pistol.  I am willing to consider shipping to an FFL, but reserve the right to refuse if the FFL looks dodgy.
I live in pasadena and work downtown. Feel free to email with any questions, or for additional pics."
