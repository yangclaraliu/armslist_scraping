The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety.
 
The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
 
The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."

The four operator selectable reticles all based on a 2MOA provide an aiming solution for most any situation. Weighing in at just under 13oz the HD7 is completely water, fog and shock proof. We built in two modes of reticle brightness operation, auto-brightness and manually operated. With the 1/2MOA windage and elevation adjustments, the HD7 is fast and easy to get zeroed to the firearm. Powered by a single AAA power source, the HD7 offers over 1000 hours of battery life (battery is not included). The HD7 also has a screw in 2x magnifier, a Quick Detach kit and a kill flash filter which are all sold separately. As with all LUCID products, the HD7 has a Limited Lifetime Warranty.

Features a 8” barrel with brass trigger guard, and case hardened hammer. This gun was only shot a few times and was well cared for – not a mark on the finish, good action and timing, good barrel/cylinder gap, and the nipples remove easily from the cylinder. I’ve got more pieces now than I can shoot during the year and this one doesn’t fit into the collection so it’s up for grabs. Price is $220 shipped to your location; money order, bank check, or personal check (personal check must clear before shipping). No trades, and please don’t ask me if I’ll take one hundred dollars for it. Serious inquiries must include your name and address. While this type of arm can be sent to almost anywhere in the U.S., there are a few urban locations that are prohibited so if Cabela’s or any other major chain can’t ship you a black powder arm, neither can I. Inquires submitted during the work week may take a half a day or so to get answered – the weekend I’m a bit faster - so please be patient."

These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Postal Money Order/Certified Check or Credit Card. Please add 3% for credit card fees. Shipping charges are extra to Alaska or Hawaii. Rifles received from IWI in our latest shipment have had a different magazine than the one pictured. Magazine may be different slightly than the one pictured."

I purchased these about a year ago and have used them only a handful of times. Shortly after purchase I had them shipped out to have the internals worked on. The internal electronic portion of the speakers are brand new (foam, cones, brackets, wiring, etc.) and the outside of these speakers is also in perfect condition. The only flaw with these is that my ex-girlfriend's cat (cats love these things) decided to claw the grille mesh on both speakers to shreds. This is a super easy repair. It takes a $10 roll of grille mesh, easily found on Amazon or at an Audio store, and some glue or staples to adhere the new mesh to the grille. I'm asking $400 OBO for the speakers, I have ~$500 in them. Trades:- Open to anything, if you have something you want to trade let me know, the worst I can say is no thank you! However I am primarily interested in the following...- Mossberg 590 or 590A1- A nice SKS- Springfield XDS 3.3 .45- Glock 19I can trade up with either cash OR a 1943 Tula Mosin for nicer rifles (AR's, AK's, VEPR's, PTR's, etc.)I can also accept trades up with cash or multi-weapon trades from you.Thanks.
