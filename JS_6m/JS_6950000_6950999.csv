Xtended Twilight Lens System: Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System™. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System® using Leupold’s® index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission they usually mean at 550 nm the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum and if your scope is cutting too much of it out soon you won’t be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When we combine that with superior computer-generated optical design lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality and 100 years of manufacturing excellence you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world. M5B2 Adjustment: Auto-Locking Pinch and Turn Adjustment: Leupold's exclusive locking adjustment that unlocks when you grip it to adjust. With a tactile revolution counter.

Cars like this 1964 Buick Riviera are no longer bargain-priced leftovers, but first-rate collectables that also happen to be some of the best driving cars of the period.Garaged nearly all of its life and for the last 16 years only a total of 80-100 miles driven in parades and short runs with other vintage rides. Evidence of some wear on the carpets and kick panels otherwise the interior is in very nice shape. I haven't detailed the motor or repainted the engine compartment as you see in some older cars. Ive got a new set of hood insulation pads (3) but will leave installation to you. Over the last 15 years or so; a newer heater core, hoses and a few other regular maintenance related items have been replaced or repaired. The body has very few marks and while not perfect it looks pretty good for its age. Repainted over 20 years ago and kept washed and waxed it's in excellent survivor condition and is a perfect candidate for restoration or a daily driver as is. The list of items needed is short; exhaust from manifolds back ($600 aluminized - $1,000 Stainless) depending on your preference, modern tires (currently wearing whitewall bias ply) and a spare wheel and tire. Will trade for guns. Ken REDACTED calls only please... too many scammers and bots... thanks for looking."

Has the adjustable target sights, along with 2 original magazines and original HK P9S 45 owners manual. IB code dates this as manufactured in 1981. Sorry, but no box. This gun has no issues, but these handguns are bullet-proof, even for a gun that's 36 years old. They have polygonal barrels which results in superior accuracy, and increased projectile velocity. Because there are no lands and grooves in the barrel, it is easier to clean and it cuts down on gas elimination. With the recoil-operated roller-locked bolt system, there is a significant reduction in recoil velocity of the slide as well as perceptible kick. If you have a P7, I would love to work out a trade. Buy quickly, as these HK's are going up, up, up, in price, especially the HK P9S in 45 caliber, making it a great investment as well.

The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the operator’s forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user. Features:  Fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0"" - 1.2"" in diameter."

Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face. The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included . Barrels on current models are 18"" long, with a chrome lined bore and chamber. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider.  All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available.Caliber: 7.62x51 / 308    Capacity: 20+1 (with standard FAL mag) Overall Length: 26"" Weight: 8.1 lbs.

The front sight is dovetailed into the barrel instead of the slide, creating additional material on the top of the barrel.

I purchased this last year and decided to SBR (short barrel rifle) it, so I filled out the Form 1. Got it approved (8 months later) and all is good. I have never fired this gun, ever. It has sat in my safe its entire sad life... I've done some research and selling an SBR, due to NFA laws, is a complete PITA. I have contacted the ATF to get this SBR removed from the NFA registry to make it a normal handgun again. I am going to go ahead and list it now to line up a buyer but it can not be sold until it has been removed from that registry - don't ask. I'll provide a copy of the notarized letter I sent the ATF and you can call to confirm once it has been removed.Selling this as a package deal. I am not going to split anything up at the moment. If I have trouble selling it, I may go that route but honestly it has sat so long I am not in a hurry. You won't be disappointed with this setup. No trades and price is non-negotiable - please don't ask for either. I've researched the prices and am being fair. Again, I am not in a hurry. Please KNOW your own state laws regarding firearms! i.e. no Commie states - sorry California and New York. Colorado still have that mag ban? I don't know them all so please make sure it is legal.There was a question about the Troy grip and Form 1. On whether it would make it an AOW (Any Other Weapon). Honestly, I am not positive. I put it on after I had my Form 1 completed and am removing it now to be on the safe side. Reducing the price $50.Update: It has been removed from the registry and is ready to sell. All questions have been answered. Still available at the moment. Included:Sig MPXP9 MPX P 9mm 8"" - unfired. It does have the Trust name (NFA required) and Celtic emblem etched into the lower.

These pistols have the sweetest trigger on the market. This pistol is brand new, in the box with all paperwork, 2-15 round magazines and unfired, except for the factory test fire. These pistols carry a lifetime warranty.
Here's what Walther says:
The PPQ has returned by popular demand and has remained a classic. The PPQ Classic sports a truly ambidextrous magazine release. Unlike the Classic, the M2 uses a U.S. style button for mag release. The trigger is the best of any striker-fired handgun with a safety lever and a short reset. Loved by many, the PPQ Classic is one of the best self-defense handguns available today.
