It is a fantastic handgun, shoots really well, never have had any type of firing malfunction, no double feeds, or ejection issues, firing strikes hard enough to get through boxes of crappy ammo, just a great gun. I'm selling really just because I don't shoot it anymore, and it isn't anything I feel like I want to keep just to have it. So that's that. I'm asking $350. Comes with everything it originally came with, two 15 rounds mags, two safety keys, and screwdriver for swapping handguards. And everything is in good working order, it has day for a year not being fired. But I have disassembled and cleaned it multiple times over that year."

There have been less than 3 boxes of ammo through this V-Bob. It is extremely accurate and it has functioned just as advertised - flawlessly.

They made these as limited inital production models. They made limited 16s and 17s. Limited 16s have 7 digit serial numbers, that is how many they produced. The 17s only have 3 digit serial numbers. These are incredibly rare. Mostly only dealers and company heads got their hands on these and still have most of them. That is why less than 100 made it to public hands out of 300 ever produced to my knowledge. I have never seen another come up for sale nor has the few big appraisors I had look at it. They came in a rolling Hardigg Storm case, 2 mags, and a Certificate of Authenticity. The intial production run was the test trial to see how well they would do. Only these were produced at a plant in the US. The same plant they made the ones for the military. After the initial production was released, all production moved to Belgium. So very few of them were made that when I called FN, they could not give me a exact number of how many were sold to the public. This is gun 186 out of all ever made. You won't see another much less one for sale. If you are lucky to see another one... it will be shot. Not brand new. Even has all the tags still on it. This is a great collectors item so dont miss it. Shoot me an offer. No I will not sell for the price of a new one that comes in a cardboard box and one mag that they made a million of. I know what its worth. Or close enough at least. Any other info email me and ill answer to the best of my knowledge. I have had several offers so just email me your best cash or trade offer."

The first true subpact in Sig Sauer's classic all-metal firearms line, the P224 is ideal for concealed or off-duty carry featuring all of the features that you would expect from Sig Sauer.
 
Based on the 229, the P224 takes advantage of the hammer-fire reliability and lightweight all-metal frame and puts them in a subcompact package with all of Sig Sauer's familiar controls and functions.
 
In spite of its small size, the P224 maintains a double-stack magazine for a higher capacity of 9mm than those in firearms of its size, at 12+1 rounds of 9mm the P224 has a distinct advantage over most of its subcompact competitors. With that advantage, the new model P229 magazines can also be used to give the P224 an even greater round count.
 
The P224 is an excellent choice for those who are familiar with the P229 manual of arms, with all the controls and operation of the P226 and P229 being the same in the P224.
 
The SIG Anti-Snag (P224 SAS) model features a de-horned slide and frame, with the new ergonomically enhanced one-piece grip. The P224 SAS comes standard with SIGLITE Night Sights in the Nitron coated slide model.
