The Speer Gold Dots are as good as it gets for .380 ammo.I comply with all laws so please bring documentation that you are a resident of Virginia and not prohibited from possessing a firearm. A concealed handgun permit, or any military/LEO ID, or any security clearance will suffice. If you don't have any of the above, you can ask your local PD to print out a page documenting no criminal history (you don't have to tell them it's for a gun, maybe you need it for a job application or travel visa etc.)Thanks for reading and hope you find something you like!Edit: Yes, I'll consider trades."

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications. GEN M3 features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning.  Redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit.  Made in U.S.A."

Solidly built with a steel frame, slide and barrel.  Completely of forged steel parts as it precedes the age of MIM. This gun represents the classic style of handguns with forged steel manufacturing, instead of stamped steel, alloy frames, plastic and polymer so common today. 
Mid-size gun is compact and great for concealed carry as it's extremely flat.  Similar to the classic 1911 Colt Commander.
Performance and Handling: Recoil is light and still very controllable even with hot loads.  The weight soaks up what normally would be snappy recoil from a compact pistol.  Love the accuracy and reliability shooting all kinds of ammo, JHP, etc.
Colt 1911 Commonalities: The many similarities to the 1911 ACP make this pistol a favorite. First, the look and feel are squarely 1911. That very classic and natural pick up. Teed ramp design is the same as on the 1911. Throated from the factory. Removable bushing as well as the swinging link.
Like the 1911, the Star using a Browning style lock up as is evidenced by the swinging link and locking lug on the barrel along with the removable barrel bushing.  The Star BM uses a FLGR with a captive recoil spring. 
Action & Trigger: single-action with locked breech. Single action trigger break is excellent – very clean! Serrated finger pad for a sure grip.
PREMIUM FEATURES:
Checkering milled into the hammer for a sure feel.
Magazine well is beveled from the factory.
Throated from the factory.
Safeties: Thumb safety on left side like the Colt 1911. You can carry cocked and locked. Gun also has a Magazine Disconnect for additional safety.
Sights: notched rear blade and serrated front ramp. Easy to pick up at speed. The sight picture is easy to obtain in both slow and rapid-fire drills. The rear sight is drift adjustable for windage.
Capacity: 8 rounds available in the magazine and one chambered.
Grips: checkered brown (not ""stiff"" but somewhat malleable.)
 
Pivoting external claw extractor like the Browning Hi Power and other major semiautomatic brands.
Trigger has serrated finger pad.
Full-length guide rod with captive recoil spring.
Removable barrel bushing.
As a testament to their quality, Star BM is still used by police, security and military agencies in Spain.   It reflects the reliability, durability and the quality of Spanish pistols and to the skill and workmanship of the workers of Star Firearms Bonifacio.
 
Conclusion:  The easy handling and resemblances to the classic Colt 1911 make this pistol a favorite among collectors, recreational shooters, or carry owners.
OTHER INFORMATION:
History & Origins: After the First World War started, Star designers fell in love with the Colt 1911 and focused on cloning it (instead of other European designs). Many German rear-echelon units used the Model B; even some officers, paratroopers and armor crewmen utilized them. After the war, many people who bought the Star BM when it was offered commercially don’t want to part with them and still carry them.
Field stripping is simple: retract the slide until the thumb safety aligns with the slide's take down notch.  You then push the safety up and into the notch on the slide.   From there you push the slide release pin out (and mine pops right out).  Then push the slide off the front and remove the guide rod and spring out of the slide.  At that point you just need to turn the barrel bushing a quarter turn to the right and it can then be pulled out of the slide. The barrel can then be easily extracted through the front of the slide."

Shoots great, just put about 50 rounds through it yesterday.  Need some cash for unexpected bills that came up today.Holds 7 rounds.  Great for Conceal Carry.  Shoots like a M9 (92fs).Love this little gun.  Has the pop-up barrell so it's great for women shooters or folks that just don't like pulling back the slide on a semi-auto pistol.  My mom (in her 70s) liked it because of her arthritis.  Just saying it's a unique feature on this firearm.Comese with 5 magazines, original box, etc.  I also have at least 2 boxes of ammo that will come with it.  The pistol magazines (clips) usually run about $15, and the ammo is $15 a box, too.  So, add it up with a firearm that already retails for $450 on its own, and this is a great buy.  I will also include personal defense ammo ($25 a box).Text for fastest response.  843-SEVEN-2-9-SIX-FIVE-2-ZERO    If I don't answer when you call, leave a message.  Thanks!"

I bought this rifle with a desire to start long range shooting. Unfortunately, I don’t have time. The barrel is 24 inches long and is chrome lined. The rifle is chambered for .308/7.62. These barrels are known shooters. Do not let the fact that it is chrome lined discourage you, in fact, do your own research regarding this rifle. I believe FN guarantees accuracy for 10,000 rounds. This is a precision rifle, with a barrel that will last you a lifetime. The stock is a McMillan A4 stock and the action was professionally bedded to the stock. I’ve only dry fired the trigger and it feels great. I haven't made any adjustments to it. Action: FN SPR, bedded to A4 stockBarrel: 24"" FN Chrome lined, heavy profileRail: Badger Ordinance Stock: McMillan A4I also have a Nightforce SHV 4-14x50 F1 that I would be willing to sell with the rifle for a total price of $2,750. Like the rifle it sits on, the scope has never been used. Included would be ARMs medium height, quick detatch rings. This would be a great tax refund present to yourself.If you have anymore questions regarding the rifle, or if you want more pics feel free to ask. I am selling it for $1600, and I am not considering trades. Also, I will not respond to low ball offers. I do not need to sell and would rather just keep than let it go for a stupid price. At $1600 you are getting an amazing deal on a brand new precision rifle. I will ship, but buyer pays the cost of packaging and shipping."

I forget the exact gas port size, but cycling rate is perfect with the H2 buffer. I am asking $700. Must have PTP or PTC and MN IDSorry no trades. Thanks,"
