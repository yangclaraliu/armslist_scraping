Colt 6 shot revolver, 4 ½” barrel
I am told that there are not many of these around that are working, and this one is legitimately functional (dry fire test only).  There is one for sale in Washington for $900, which I think is too high based on my research.  In fact, this one is offered at the lowest advertised price in the country.  It was part of an estate sale/inheritance, and I have several other vintage pistols that were part of a collection.  I am not an FFL dealer, but I do have a CPL
The pistol appears to be fully operational and does not appear to have any trouble rotating the cylinder or firing. The finish is faded in areas but contains no significant rust. The original grips appear to be free of cracks or major defects.
The Colt website dates the year of manufacture to be around 1899 (Serial = 1194XX)
There is a marking on the cylinder release and under the barrel showing “489”
It appears to be original, and unmodified. It does not come with any box or papers. 
$499 with FFL transfer fee paid by the seller, which is the lowest price advertised in the country. Given that it appears to have been manufactured after 1898, by law an FFL transfer is required."

The AR-15's straight-line stock design eliminates the fulcrum created by traditional bent stocks, reducing muzzle climb. The aircraft grade aluminum receiver is lightweight and highly corrosion-resistant and the synthetic stock and grips do not warp or splinter. The AR-15's direct impingement gas system is fast-acting and reliable whether housed in the US Military's M-16 or a civilian AR-15. The HBAR Elite has a 24"" heavy stainless barrel that ups the accuracy of the already precise AR design. This rifle features a fixed stock, a 2-position safety, and one magazine.

ATTITUDE. PERFORMANCE.   Cobalt Kinetics loves firearms. We are students of their history and heritage. Cobalt Kinetics is fascinated by how they work and how they are made. We are inspired by the engineering and precision of a well-made weapon. Cobalt is driven to create firearms that are more effective, more reliable and more rewarding for the owner. We founded Cobalt Kinetics because, as gun enthusiasts, we were not satisfied with the status quo – rows of the same mediocre guns on every gun shop wall across the country. We wanted better firearms, but we knew the firearms industry had no real reason to change itself. So, we decided to change the industry. Cobalt Kinetics designs and builds firearms with bold aesthetics, cutting-edge technical innovations, state-of-the-art engineering and meticulous precision. Firearms that inspire a passion for shooting because they look, feel and work better than any others. Firearms that other companies only dream of building. The firearms we always dreamed of owning.   Cobalt Kinetics wants you to share our love of firearms, to own firearms that deliver beauty, quality, performance and value far beyond their price. We want your firearms to be a source of great personal pride and create a personal legacy that can be shared for generations. Above all else, we want you to experience shooting without compromise, to have the confidence you need to put the round on target every time whether you are in the field, on the range, on guard or on point. We want your firearms to be Cobalt Kinetics firearms. The ultimate combination of artistry, attitude and performance.   The Cobalt Kinetics B.A.M.F. redefines the AR-15. It is precision machined from aircraft grade 7075 billet aluminum to the tightest possible tolerances. Its revolutionary, patent-pending Dual Drop, multifunctional bolt release sets new standards for AR performance. And its aggressive lines and badass attitude puts it front and center, before the ranks of conventional ARs.

This is a “center pin” model that uses a pin to hold in the cylinder.
This is a blued frame pistol with OEM dark brown square butt grip.
The MODEL 622 is a large solid frame, pull-pin cylinder removal, dual action or single action 6 shot .22 with a 2.5” barrel. Serial number T2734X
They were produced between 1957 and 1973. This gun will handle any modern .22 long rifle or short cartridge.
The ""center pin"" designation merely indicates that the piece was loaded and unloaded by removing the ""cylinder or center pin"" dropping the cylinder free of the frame.
It appears to be in fully functional shape but I have never fired it.
I have one H&R 622 for sale, an H&R 632 (which is a 32 caliber revolver with a smaller, more rounded butt) and a longer barrel H&R 922 8 shot .22 caliber revolver. All of them are for sale. I also have about a dozen older top break 32s and 38s that are also for sale."

Walnut stock. Has a Nikon 3x9x40 adjustable Buckmasterr scope. This rifle is already sighted in dead on at 100 yards. I actually harvested a doe this past weekend with this rifle. I have owned this rifle for 15 years. I cannot count how many deer I have harvested with this rifle. It's dead accurate and never has let me down. I recently purchased a 300 WSM so I can hunt larger game next year. My original plan was to give it to my 15 year old daughter for her deer gun this year. It's simply too much caliber for her. I am selling this rifle so I can purchase a smaller caliber for her to hunt. That's the only reason am I parting ways with this rifle. It is used with normal scratches. I have cleaned the rifle every season and cared for it. No rust. I am also selling 13 boxes of ammo and ammo can with this package deal. Im asking $400.00 cash for everything which is a steal. I spent over $200.00 on the ammo alone. The scope was $129.00 new. If you only want the rifle by itself, I will take $300.00 for it. No low ballers please. This is a quality gun. Older gun but not abused. The walnut stock makes for a very nice look. Please text or or call me at REDACTED. I do not check emails very often. Thanks Michael"

The Archangel stock allows you to use magazines opposed to stripper clips or manually loading one at a time. I have the original stock that came with it. I have not cut off the 2 metal rings that holds the original stock on in case you want to go back to the wood stock. Nothing else comes with the Mosin, what you see in the picture is what you get – the tools, sling, oil can and ammo pouch did not come with the Mosin.
