I have one factory detachable box mag that holds 4 rounds. Rifle has a total of 23 rounds down range so far. No more no less. This is deadly accurate as is for all Sakos from the factory. I have used the factory irons since purchased and they are right on the money. I can ring a 10x10 plate at 500yds. Rifle is more accurate than that though. If you are a 338Fed fan this is a beautiful girl to add to your collection. And she shoots as good as she looks....shes the full package. $2000 338 is not available anymore in this model.Will meet at Harbor Freight in Mason or Police Station by high school in Mason.

Great patina and about 50% of the finish remains which is exactly where it should be for its age. Runs like a sewing machine on everything I put through it (Remington standard velocity, cci mini mags and standard velocity, Winchester 333, federal auto mags and some Aguila). Unique design feeds through the stock. A retaining tube removes from the butt plate. Like a tube fed glenfield but in reverse. Very cool! All original everything right down to the sight blade. Has plenty of small marks and dings as it should for its age. Appears to be original finish on all wood. No cracks. Also has more desirable early NON micro groove receiver. These are getting hard to find in this condition at 80 years old. Ones with all original everything like this have sold routinely on gunbroker for $700-$1000. First $550 Cash takes it!

This is an all steel pistol with all the features one looks for in a CCW piece. The Ranger is small with a 3.5 inch taper cone barrel, good trigger pull, no sharp edges and a small frame for concealability. The grip panels are thin flat checkered for a low profile but solid gripping surface. Like its big brother the Trojan, the Ranger uses STI’s tree bark type front strap texturing instead of checkering. In a carry pistol this is great as it affords a good grip but does not aid in wear and tear of clothes. The Ranger is an all business handgun, in a real caliber for our test piece, 45ACP, is there another choice? With its all steel construction, it readily handled the hottest loads from Cor-Bon and Triton with minimal recoil, something similar sized alloy framed 1911s can’t lay claim to doing. Ammunition run through the Ranger included Cor-Bon, Triton Hi-Vel, PMC, Blackhills, CCI, Seller & Belliot, Remington, and Winchester; all in a variety of weights and bullet styles. As was expected this little 1911 shot everything well, with 7 shot off-hand groups averaging 3? at 20 yards.Pistol is in fully working condition."

The Beretta APX, utilizing a removable, serialized chassis frame, can be easily modified with a replaceable grip frame housing and is simple to disassemble and maintain. The lightweight frame housing is made of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The APX’s extremely low profile and snag free design make it easy to carry and draw from a holster. Ease of use was the key driver in the development of the APX. A slide catch lever is located on both sides of the frame. The operating/locking system is based on a tilt-barrel, locked breech. Beretta APX pistols have a unique feature that allows the user to deactivate the internal striker mechanism prior to disassembly. This means the pistol can be field stripped without pulling the trigger. The Trigger Safety stops the trigger from traveling rearward through inertia, in the event the pistol is dropped. When the trigger is intentionally pulled, the Trigger Safety is instantly deactivated. The high-definition 3-dot sight system is designed for quick target acquisition. The new sight system, patented by Beretta, allows the user to adjust both front and rear sights. The sights can be removed for replacement with other types of sights. Thanks to a newly patented modular system, the pistol adapts to different hand sizes with interchangeable back-straps of different thickness and configuration for individualized performance. The pistol comes with a standard Picatinny rail (MIL STD 1913) under the barrel. Frame safety, magazine safety, and a loaded chamber indicator are available on request. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the APX’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.Specifications:Caliber: 9 x 19 mmWeight Unloaded: 27 ouncesBarrel Length: 4.25 in.

It has the expected patina of a ~80 years old firearm.  It was examined by a local gunsmith who also fired 3 rounds through it.  The pistol should be of interest to collectors, as there are more modern pistols available for target practice and personal defense.  Since the pistol is basically a family heirloom and has a certain amount of sentimental value, I am really just seeing what's out there.  Low ballers will be ignored.
