Styled in the familiar AR configuration, it’s a no-nonsense rifle you can trust with anything—including your life. This tough-as-nails rifle was designed specifically to answer the call for a low-maintenance, enhanced reliability carbine. The REC7 rifle’s dependability stems largely from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts, the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean, reducing maintenance requirements and increasing endurance. The patented chrome-lined fluted gas block prevents excessive carbon buildup from operation under adverse conditions. The one-piece 17-4 stainless piston transfers energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel, the carrier features an integral piston strike face. The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high-strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7, not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt’s gas-ring-free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance. At the heart of the operating system is a nitrided, two-position, forward-venting gas plug that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the front of the gas block without removing the handguard so optical sights or laser devices do not need to be zeroed after routine maintenance. The REC7 rifle’s forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are Type 3 Class 2 hardcoat anodized and Cerakote finished. The lower houses an ultra-dependable single-stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated, hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrel with M4 feed ramps machined into the receiver and the barrel extension. A mil-spec A2 flash hider protects the muzzle. In 5.56 NATO and 6.8 SPC, the REC7 is everything you’d expect from a Barrett rifle, and then some."

The Tier one Glock features a trued mating of the frame and slide for optimal smooth tracking.

The slide features enhanced rear cocking serrations for positive manipulations and the additional positive cocking serrations for press checks. The frame features a full hand stipple and double trigger guard undercut providing the user with a higher grip and added enhanced stippled surface for control.
