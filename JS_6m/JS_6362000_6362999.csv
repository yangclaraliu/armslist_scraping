It was imported by KBI. I bought the gun about 10 years ago used I am not sure of the previous round count but put about 50 rounds through it myself and sat it in the safe. It has the original target grips on it but, I also have an original set of grips that are not target but just flat which makes the gun a little more thinner at the handle.  I have an extra magazine as well. I do not have the box for it as it did not come with it. The magazine themselves sell for over $60.00 and with the extra set of grips this makes  that an easy extra $100.00 right there. Great for a back up carry for size and weight and with its fixed barrel is very accurate. The gun itself is in good condition, it isnt brand new but not bad for its age.

I don't even know how many thousand rounds I have, all new factory made, Whinchester and Federal. Walmart is selling for 35/100. I'm interested in all sorts of stuff, from amom to firearms to scopes. The worst I can do is say no. If anyone is interested I can get an accurate count, but I'm guessing at at least 2K plus. Thanks. REDACTED"
