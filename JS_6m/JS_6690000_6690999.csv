This is a factory made AR so has a lifetime guarantee and AP is amazing.  I just sent back this same exact gun but in 556 to have the trigger adjusted and they paid for everything. This gun is basically brand new. I've only put two mags through it to get it sighted in. It's guaranteed sub MOA at 100 yards by AP and I was able to get down to .92 at 100 years on second mag. It also has some upgrades done by Bracken Guns (gunsmith). I had them add an adjustable gas block as I was going to run it suppressed but am still waiting for suppressor. I also had them add a QD end plate, BCM charging handle, hogue grip, mag pull stock, and a PWS FSC compensator. The same one used on Scar 17's. In addition to that I bought it with the upgraded sub MOA ballistic advantage 16 inch barrel. The BCG is nitrated with a nickle plated bolt. This gun is amazing and light. The only reason I'm selling as I just took delivery on a new sig 716 gen 2 DMR. I'm actually considering getting rid of that as this is just as nice and MUCH lighter. I will also include the griffen armament rail attachments. This is an M-LOk handguard. I am interested in trades for a Kel-tec Bullpup's, IWI x95, Tavor, Galil ace, PTR, or highend pistols. I will sell outright for $1,100 OBO. The gun alone sells for over $1500 new and this has over $400 in upgrades.  Please acr quick as I may end up stripping it and selling bone stock if it doesn't move in timely manner."

There are several ways to tell if an ad is a scam
A. Do a reverse image search of the pictures posted. You can do this by right clicking the image and clicking ""search google for this image"". If there are other copies of this image on the web, chances are this is a scam.
B. Search the text posted in the ad. If it was a copy/paste and the text appears in another ad, this is a scam. I found one that still had the ""first one to post I'll take it, wins."" from the AK-Files. Often times old versions of the same ad pop up posted in different cities. Obviously a scam.
C. The price is obviously way too low for the firearm. IE: no one will sell a $5,000 PKM kit for $1,000. Obviously a scam.
D. Ask for additional pictures of specific parts of the gun. If they are unable to provide those, it's a scam.
E. If they pass all of the above tests, DO NOT send any money yet. Arrange to have them go to their FFL before payment is made. Go to your respective FFL and have them contact each other. If their FFL can verify the weapon is there in the condition posted, you are good. If not, it's a scam.
Stay safe out there, and don't give your money to asshole con-artists! I dream of a day a Dexter like individual dedicates his life to tracking down armslist scammers and makes them disappear."

If I can't get $350 for it, I'd rather keep it.  Also, NO TRADES of any kind.  CASH ONLY.This rifle is accurate, and easy to shoot.  I really like the Savage Accu-Trigger.  I didn't shoot it much, because I like the AR-15 so much better.  This has been a safe queen for the past 8 years, so it's time for somebody to enjoy it."

It's designed to satisfy the needs of modern shooters not only in popular shooting sports but also for tactical and defensive applications. The long, 15” DDM4 quad rail over a 16” cold hammer forged Light Weight profile barrel gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse allows for quick but precise rapid fire. The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.

Manufacturers number SUB2K9GLK17BBLK. The Sub2000 Gen. 2 is the natural evolution of the folding pistol-caliber-carbine with a few new extras. How do you take a gun that was already solid and make it even better? Keeping the form, function, and mechanical action the same, this overhaul focuses on ascetics and ergonomics. Looking at the Gen. 2, the first thing you will notice is that the polymer encasement has been overhauled, trimmed, and textured. Railed surfaces have been added on the top and bottom of the handguard as well as M-lock slots on the sides. The front sight has been vastly improved from the first generation. Modeled after an AR-15’s front sight, the Gen. 2 front site is now constructed of metal and is adjustable for windage and elevation. The barrel is threaded for use with a suppressor. The front sight will need to be removed before a suppressor can be secured the gun. The stock of the Gen.2 is also improved, giving the user the option for length-of-pull adjustment, as well as sling mounting surfaces. The Sub2000 Gen.2 is a vast improvement over its predecessor and it gives the user a gun that is less of a novelty and more of a real-world option for personal defense. Keltec sub 2k has a 16'' barrel, includes 1 10 round mag but accepts 9MM Glock mags(10,17&33 round mags)BUYER'S RESPONSIBILITY: It is your responsibility to ensure that the firearm you wish to purchase is legal in your state.

The action is smooth, and this is an accurate little gun. It has a nice wooden stock, and comes with a 3-9x40 scope and rings (not mounted). Note that the rifle does NOT have iron sights; you must mount an optic. I did have two magazines for this rifle, but unfortunately they were taken and not returned to me, so you will have to get a magazine, or load it like a single shot. The magazines are fairly common at gun shops and sporting goods stores, as well as being readily available through several online retailers. The price reflects the missing magazine.This would make a great gun for plinking/target shooting, hunting very small game, or teaching younger ones how to shoot. Comes with orginal cardboard box, owners manual, and lock.Asking $100 OBO. I'm not interested in any trades. Thanks for looking.Note: I have more pictures available in high resolution upon request."
