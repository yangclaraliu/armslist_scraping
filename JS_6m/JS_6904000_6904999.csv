I am thinning my collection and have several listed so please take a look at my other pistols on armslist. Thank you for your time and have a good day. I do have other hard to find guns that are not listed. For example I have many colt guns such as hard to find EL CEN series 1911 38 super, Detective Specials, Snake guns such as unfired enhanced drilled tapped 4 inch Colt King Cobra , unfired 4 inch drilled tapped Colt Anaconda (extremely rare year of 2000) , stainless 4 inch Python (shot 6 times), 6 and 4 inch nicel Python.Hard to find Smith and Wesson guns such as 625-2 (model of 1988 which is believed to only have had 1500 made, all original), Pre-lock Lady Smith revolver, pre-lock 29-3 combat, chiefs special cs-9 like new, and an engraved unfired Smith model 29-10.Have several 1911 guns in brands such as Rock Island, Ruger, Springfield including Loader Operator MC and TRP Operator, Para Ordinance 14 45 limited stainless double stack with 4 mags, early Kimber combat carry with laser gripsAlso have a Walther PPK (Interarms Richmond VA the rarer one) basically like new and a Walther ppk/s with crimson trace laser and box, (smith and wesson) I may accept trades toward other guns and/ or ammo if at a really good deal. Trades would need to be in my favor or something rare that I am looking for. Multiple gun trades are welcome. I prefer pistols though.If you live out of state, purchase will have to be through squaretrade or venmo to protect us both. If you have to send payment any other way, it has to go through gunbroker. We will have to do the transfer through an ffl and you will be responsible for the transfer. All state laws will be followed."

Excellent condition. Comes with original box. The S&W Model 547 is a heavy barrel, 9mm (9x19) version of the legendary K-frame, 6-shot M&P revolver. S&W made 10,270 of these from 1980-1985; 6486 round with butt (and 3"" barrel), and 3784 with a square butt and 4"" barrel. This Model 547 features walnut magna grips with S&W medallions, a 1/8"" serrated ramp front sight, with the typical M&P style square notch rear sight. It has a .265"" flat face short throw semi-bobbed hammer, and a .312"" smooth trigger. From what I know, the reason for this revolver's existence comes from the Middle East. In the late 1970's, the Israelis wanted to arm the Palestinian Police force with a 9mm handgun, but didn't trust them with an autoloading pistol. Instead, they wanted a simple-to-use a revolver chambered in 9mm (and by ""simple-to-use"", they meant ""no-moon-clips""). They contracted with Smith & Wesson to make it for them. Soon after Smith & Wesson delivered the first shipment of these revolvers, the Israeli government cancelled the rest of the order and instead bought an IMI revolver that was a Model 547 knockoff. S&W released the remaining guns to the civilian market. Shipping is $15"

Review by Tim        Quality       Love the feel of this gun! I installed talon grips. This is the best feeling handgun I own! I wish there was a night sight version of sights! I am a left handed shooter and wish the mag release was ambidextrous!! (Posted on 3/6/2017) The Best Pistol Nobody Knows About Review by max2330        Quality       I saw one of these pistols in a LGS a few years ago. It has always intrigued me, but I just never picked one up. I finally got around to getting one and I am very impressed. I wish I had got one years ago. The quality is better than I expected. This is a very well built pistol and the PLUS mags it came with are very good quality as well. The grip angle is a little strange and the sights take some getting used to, but the pistol shoots great and the accuracy is very good. Shoot it best rapid fire...for some reason. I think if Steyr would advertise this "" Off The Radar"" pistol more heavily, it would be a great seller and a great success. If you are considering getting one...GET ONE!!  (Posted on 3/3/2017) Updated review**** Review by Alejandro        Quality       So I just wanted to update in my initial review. I have this pistol for almost two years now, Columbia consistently use it as my daily off duty carry and have put through approximately 5000 rounds. The pros: no malfunctions so far, which I think is impressive (I only use factory ammo, no reloads). The sights are easy to obtain when shooting and it's a very accurate gun, the ergonomics still magnificent, the only thing I added was talon grips because I personally like a more ""rough"" texture. The only cons I can add to this review are the non existing night sights for the trapezoidal factory ones, I think adding a night version of those will be outstanding, also interchangeable grip options will be useful. Another con is the difficulty to find a variety of accessories like holsters and such... overall this is a great firearm! (Posted on 3/3/2017)"

You won't find a better deal on this rifle unless it's an older model! The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.The R.E.P.R. rifle is available in three models: Standard Model (16.1”) and Sniper Model (20”). The DMR and Sniper models will feature Geissele triggers. Each R.E.P.R. rifle comes with one barreled upper, but extra uppers are available in light contour 16.1” and heavy contour 20” configurations. Custom packages including one lower and two or more barreled uppers are available. These packages can be had with a variety of optics and accessories. Contact our customer service department for specifications.New for 2012, we are offering the 16” R.E.P.R. with a spiral fluted barrel. The spiral fluting shaves weight while relieving longitudinal stresses that can cause ‘stringing’ in barrels with conventional linear fluting. The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with.Caliber: 7.62 NATO/.308 WinchesterBarrel Length: 20""Weight (unloaded): 11.25lbs (20"")Length (overall): 41.5""(20"")Rate of Fire: 55 RPM (Sustained ROF)Rifling: 1/10"" RHStock/Pistol Grip: 20"" Magpul PRS/Magpul MIADSights: LWRCI Folding BUIS Front and RearMagazine: Magpul 20 rd.

This indicated this was built in Germany and not the US, as some are. This is the A1 model The MSRP is somewhere between 1,000 - 1,200 that I can tell.

Selling a lightly used Smith and Wesson M&P Shield in .40. Comes with ammo shown, most of it being target/practice ammo. Also comes with shown Blackhawk paddle holster with trigger guard lock (will not easily be grabbed by someone other than carrier). The rounds missing from the target ammo shown are what I have fired with it. I bought it new last fall and have taken very good care of it. It's a great gun for up close self defense, I just can't handle the recoil. Fits nicely in my hand with the longer mag, shorter mag makes my pinky dangle off (for relativity, I'm a woman with larger than typical hands, so it would fit most women's hands and smaller men's hands nicely). This is a very popular sidearm on the market right now, and you are hard pressed to find one in decent shape for this kind of a deal. Willing to go $350 for just the firearm and holster, or $400 for everything. Will provide bill of sale upon transaction. Will only meet in a public setting. If you would like to shoot it before purchase, please provide the name of the range you would like to take it to in your email."
