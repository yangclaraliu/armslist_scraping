The Polish P-64 magazine is a single-stack magazine that is designed to hold and feed six rounds of 9x18mm Makarov ammunition for your Polish P-64. Our magazine is manufactured entirely from steel, save the polymer floor plate (finger rest). The steel body has been fully heat treated and features a rear seam that has been laser welded to ensure your magazine remains durable and reliable for years to come. Additionally, the inclusion of a follower spring that is seven percent stronger than surplus magazines ensures that our magazine will properly feed upon each discharge. As noted, the Polish P-64 magazine was the first magazine we ever had produced. As such, we created the goal to produce a P-64 magazine that would be 100 percent reliable and functional in all Polish P-64 pistols that would satisfy both ourselves and our customers. The Polish P-64 magazine is the fruit of our effort and we are now proud to guarantee proper function of our magazines. Our extensive field testing, which incorporated the use of several different P-64s and a number of different types of 9x18mm Makarov ammunition proved one thing – our Polish P-64 magazine is one of the best magazines money can buy.   These are new, however, they may or may not come wrapped in a package.   Price: $29.99 each"

This rifle has a heavy 18” stainless barrel and a Hogue OverMolded Stock. The overall length of the firearm is about 37” and it weighs in at 7.3 lbs. The receiver has an integrated weaver style base for scope mounting. This rifle is different from most other failed semi auto .22 magnum rifle, that jam all of the time, as it has unique Gas-Assisted Blowback operation and this patented gas system and block under the barrel traps a small amount of gas through an orifice hole in the barrel allowing the firearm to be reliable. You cannot shoot 30 grain ammo through this rifle as it will not function properly. You need to shoot 40 to 50 grain ammo through these rifles for them to function. I have tested this rifle and it likes CCI Maxi Mag, really well and it does pretty well with Winchester Super X. I am sure that it will shoot other brands and types of ammos also, but this is all that I had at the time. You will have to find the ammo that this rifle likes, as far a function is concerned.   There is no box or paperwork, just one 9 round magazine. The magazines by the way are produced by Ruger as this is a Ruger 10/22 design firearm. I see no issues with this firearm. It functions well and there is no damage of any kind, just a few handling marks here and there. This firearm would grade 95% according to the NRA grading system.  If you have any questions please feel free to contact me, REDACTED, ask for John. REDACTED"

The Remington 760 has a rotary bolt lock up design that provides exceptional strength, safety, and reliability. The twin action bars provide a slick, smooth operation that allows for rapid repeat shots. The 760 also has a four round quick release, drop out magazine. The barrel is free floated and this provides accuracy that will match most bolt actions. The barrel length is 22”. The finish is blue and the butt stock and forearm are textured synthetic made by Ram Line. The rifle is drilled and tapped for scope mounting. This one does have rear and front sight that are adjustable. This is a nice firearm, it has been hunted with and it does show some handling marks here and there. There a couple of small spots of corrosion on the right side of the receiver. I also see some minor corrosion on the forearm stud. Other than that I only see a few small rubs and minor scratches. This one still has the bolt dust cover. The barrel and chamber are in good condition. This firearm would grade 80% plus according to the NRA grading system. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me, REDACTED, ask for John. REDACTED"

This easy-to-use product can get a shooter within three to four inches of the bull's-eye at 100 yards in about three shots.  This unit is also excellent for modern rifles and its modest design works great with most flash suppressors and muzzle breaks.
This is a great, easy way to make your firearm pinpoint accurate and saves time and money in the process.
It is powered by three 393 batteries, which I just installed new on Friday.
I'm also including a new LaserLyte brand reflective daytime target, which is normally sold separately from the bore sight. 
The Daylight Laser Target is made from a special reflective material which allows you to see the laser dot even in direct sunlight. The 4"" x 6 1/2"" target has a pressure sensitive adhesive back which allows it to be applied to any hard fixed surface.
Price is $30 for everything.
I'll also trade for Glock 19 or 42 mags or brass-cased .380, 9mm, or .45 ammo.

Gun was both in late 2014. Shot only a few times on the range. Reason- it's just not my kind of a gun, I preffer 1911 style more, and striker fired slim guns. Since I was new to the guns at the time I foolishly dumped more money in it than I should have. However, all was done by Sig Custom Shop so it's factory warranted professional work of which I have a proof of course, should you care to see it.What was done to the gun: I sent it in last year to have the Short Reset Trigger($99.95) and Action Enhancement Package($179.95) done. I also had them instal E2 grips($100) which are a little bit more slimmer than the originals it came with, I kept the originals.I thought that I would be CCing it so I had ordered a custom made holster from Wright Leather Works for it. It's a Cobra hybrid holster for both IWB and OWB with a Master upgrade which means that extra care was dedicated to the interior of the holster and additional very supple leather stitched inside to preserve the gun finish. I also had a matching magazine holder with it. Total for the holster mag combo:$200. In addition to the aforementioned things I also have a lot of assorted Sig original spare parts, ADDITIONAL E2 grips and all the parts with it, additonal Remora holster and mag holder made for this gun specifically as well as a Fobus paddle holster. Gun comes with it's factory box and 3 mags. best cash offer gets it.

Submitted Form 1 to the ATF with the intent of SBR'ing it, but have since lost interest and would like to use the cash for other gun projects. Currently has the name of my trust engraved on the ejection port side of the receiver, but this is small and subtle and can be left as-is, covered up, or lasered over - happy to work with you for an amicable solution. There are no legal implications and I am waiting for the ATF to log my Form 1 application so that I can cancel it and get my $200 back.   This is an Arsenal SLR104-UR, specifically the SLR104-51 with the polymer folding stock. Has a factory 16"" barrel. Purchased 8/26 and upon receipt, gun was sent back to Arsenal for canted rear sight and loose gas tube/upper hand guard. Arsenal remedied both issues and it is near perfect now. Gun has just four mags through it (120 rounds) and ran flawlessly. I've sinced installed an ALG Defense (subsidiary of Geissele Automatics) AKT trigger (new, unfired) and polished some of the contact points on the bolt and carrier.  Included in this package are the following items:  (2) Circle 10 black polymer 30-round AK-74 magazines (2) Russian Tula plum 30-round AK-74 magazines (1) Russian Izhmash bakelite 30-round AK-74 magazine (1) Russian Tula bakelite 30-round AK-74 magazine  (390) rounds of Silver Bear 5.45x39mm, 60-grain FMJ, non-corrosvie ammo (7 new unopenend boxes of 30 and the remainder loaded into the six magazines) (1) Russian Tula AKS-74U ribbed, rolled edged triangle folding stock (4.5mm hinge) (1) new Arsenal Krinkov style booster flash hider (Made in USA) (1) Arsenal factory olive drab sling +misc extras including original trigger  Total invested into this package is well over $1,900.   I am not interested in any trades or partial trades. Selling as a complete package for $1,700 as-is. The only way the price is coming down is if I start taking things out of the bundle. Call/text Scott at REDACTED.

The bushingless bull barrel locks up to the slide like a bank vault. I've shot less than 200 rounds through it, and decided it's too nice a gun for me. I paid four figures for it this year, not counting the extra mag I picked up.This is the NRA Guardian edition, which was featured at FNRA banquets this year. The only enhancement I know of is a tasteful ""NRA"" above ""Guardian"" on the side. Check out the pics.This gun is in great shape, and there is a wait for almost all STI guns. MSRP is $1300 new. I'm asking $900 cash for the pistol, two mags and the factory case. I really want an M1A, so I'll consider trade toward a SOCOM or Scout M1A. Will also consider trade toward an LR-308."

This pistol is like new with only about 50 rounds through it and no problems whatsoever. Comes with original box, three magazines, and all three grip inserts. The trigger kit was installed professionally at Lynnwood Guns and Ammunition and makes this pistol (in my opinion) far superior to a standard M&P. There is no long trigger take up, a strong reset, and a 4.5lb trigger pull. The HD Trijicon night sights also offer faster target acquisition and sight visibility at all times. I bought this setup last year with plans to carry it on duty (because I didn't like the trigger on the standard S&W) and it shoots so much better now. Unfortunately I didn't realize I wouldn't be allowed to carry a firearm with after market parts so I cannot use it as I had intended. So I'm now selling this like new pistol with awesome upgrades for only $500 so I can find a standard gun I like better than the standard S&W. Buyer pays a $30 background check/transfer fee at Lynnwood Guns (or the Snohomish County shop of your choice for whatever price you can find). This is a great pistol so let me know if you want to check it out. Once you feel the trigger you will be hooked."
