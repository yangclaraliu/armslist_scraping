It has the cartouche and WRA/GHD on the left side and circle P on the bottom. The op rod has been cut, which was done to nearly every Garand following the war because many of the op rods cracked after excessive use without this cut. Also, the hammer is Springfield Armory produced (marked SA). The bore is excellent and shiny with strong rifling - I'd rate it an 8/10. C&R eligible. No import marks.

MVP Patrol is a 7 ½ pound rifle (not including optic) that, as the name implies, is short, light and handy enough to tote around in a car or pack. The 16 ¼ inch barrel is capped by a standard birdcage flash hider, which means that threading for suppressor attachment is already there. The stock is composite and the forend is thick and sturdy. The Patrol is a hard use rifle, not a svelte and trim hunter model, although there’s no reason it wouldn’t serve as a great field rifle.

The model tested was the 7.62mm NATO and it was stamped accordingly on the barrel. The barrel itself features a 1:10 twist rate and is finished with a matte blueing. The synthetic stock is all business with molded texture in the grip and forend. The rifle is available with your choice of black or tan stocks. Two sling swivel attachments round out the stock itself. End to end, including the flash hider and recoil pad, the rifle measures 37 ½ inches and length of pull is 13 ¼ inches."

I eventually got to take it to the gun range and really liked how it felt and how accurately it shot. I also liked the trigger, although it was lighter and with a shorter reset than I had experienced on any of my previous semi-automatic pistols.I did have some light primer strikes, which I did not like. I took it back out to the range a few days later and had some additional light primer strikes. I contacted the Bersa distributor and they responded immediately. They were very helpful and provided an authorized warranty center contact. I called them and explained the issue of light primer strikes. The gunsmith asked me for the serial number and, as I started reading it to him, told me that those serial numbers came with a different firing pin and spring than the later serial numbers.The gunsmith told me to send the gun to him and he would replace those parts, inspect and ensure the gun is fully functional, and clean and return it to me. I received the gun back last week and they had replaced the firing pin and spring. I had a chance to take it to the range late yesterday afternoon and put 100 rounds of a combination of Federal and Perfecta FMJ 115 grain ammo through the gun. I didn't have a single light primer strike or any other issue.This Bersa doesn't have a safety and I don't believe at this time I will be carrying a conceal gun without one (just a personal choice) so I am selling it. It does have a internal locking system on the right side of the slide operated by the included Bersa key that enables you to prevent the gun from firing if you prefer for household safety, but I never had a need to utilize that feature.Sale includes everything you see in the pictures, plus assorted parts the distributor sent me at my request in lieu of reimbursing me for shipping charges to the gunsmith. Those parts include a new firing pin assembly and recoil spring guide assembly. This is a great price on a really nice single-stack 9mm.""Must be able to complete at this time a local face-to-face cash sale.

The boat is old so the hinges on the front deck are gone from rust and it has a tiny leak at the plug hole. Looking to trade for a utility trailer but I'm open to ANY and ALL trades. The majority of the value is in the trailer and motor. The trailer can fit a 12-14' boat and is very well built. I have videos of the engine running in a bucket and out on the river. I am willing to split components for the right trade but I figure if you just want the trailer or engine, you can sell or scrap the boat for cash. TITLE IN HAND. I also have an anchor, paddle, fire extinguisher, whistle, life jacket, throwable, spare tire for the trailer. The boat is not pretty but it is able to be on the water.

It's not cheap however, the QRB system was $350, and the YHM handguard was $70.  So, if you subtract that from my asking price of $800, you're getting a new AR with quality components for only $380.  So, $800 is firm.That said, I'm open to trades with +/- cash.  Here's what I'm looking for: TA33 ACOG, Beretta M9, 1911sBtw, if you're local FTF, I'll ask if we can do an official transfer through an FFL.  Better safe than sorry these days.  I'll cover the cost."

Also comes with a brand new trolling motor and deep cell battery, never used. Fresh carb rebuild on the motor(and I have another carb kit) runs great and starts right up. The boat needs some love but I fish out of it just the way it is. The boat is old so the hinges on the front deck are gone from rust and it has a tiny leak at the plug hole. Looking to trade for a utility trailer but I'm open to ANY and ALL trades. The majority of the value is in the trailer, trolling motor and engine. The trailer can fit a 12-14' boat and is very well built. I have videos of the engine running in a bucket and out on the river. I am willing to split components for the right trade but I figure if you just want the trailer or engine, you can sell or scrap the boat for cash. TITLE IN HAND. I also have an anchor, paddle, fire extinguisher, whistle, life jacket, throwable, spare tire for the trailer. The boat is not pretty but it is able to be on the water. Contact me for more pictures, videos or information. The brand new trolling motor and battery i paid $200 for, motor at 300, trailer at 200 and I'll leave the hull completely out so me asking 500 trade value is fair."

Can be adjusted for weight of pull, travel, power, 2 or single stages.
 
This trigger has been modified to fit most Kalashnikov's without modifications. 
 The trigger has been widened, opened up in the rear to clear the trigger guard rivets. The adjustment screws have been moved slightly but, are basically in the same location. Some AK's may need the receiver window altered to allow the trigger to fit through the receiver hole so, it will move freely in the receiver (we have found the Maadi's need this modification more then any others out there but, it is possible for there to be others). Please follow the sequence in the enclosed instructions.
 
The ONLY 100% milled AK trigger group made in the USA. Made the right way, from solid steel bar stock. Before, the American shooter had to settle for cast or MIM'd copies of the original parts, not anymore! RSA offers the first fully adjustable Kalashnikov fire control system.I'm also including aHammer and Trigger Pin Retaining Plate with this trigger as well, these are way better than the paperclip stock clip.I have 3 Trigger / Retainer Plate Sets, $50 ea. or buy all 3 for $100, buy 2 and get the 3rd free!
