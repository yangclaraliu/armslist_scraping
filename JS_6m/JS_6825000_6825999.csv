First owner, genley used, moderate holster wear, ~150-200 rounds fired.
Custom cut compensation ports in slide and barrel - this type of mod usually calls for a ""bull"" type or ""heavy"" barrel but I just had the standard bushing barrel ported so there is a clearance between the barrel and the slide that collects carbon with heavy use. Nothing a good cleaning doesn't remedy.
Ground a thumb notch in the left grip pannel to allow my stubby fingers to reach the mag release with more ease. Still have the factory SA wooden grips.
Extended magwell - don't remember which manufacturer but it's similar to Fusion Firearms style that replaces the mainspring housing and the magwell bolts into the bottom.
Sweet shooter, just need to fund another dream of mine.
Comes with 1 magazine, make an offer for the other 9 if you want - I won't need them. 
I also have the original case as well as the factory mainspring housing with the safety lockout whizz-bang mechanism. Can also dig up the plastic holster and mag pouch if desired.
Asking $700
Willing to drive to sensible location for face to face."

This rifle has had a lot of work done to it. You would never think it's an axis after shooting it. The trigger is light and very very crisp. It is, in my opinion, better than the accutrigger on my 17 and 243. The stock has weight added to it. This rifle is balanced great and recoil is next to nothing. There is a barrel de-resonator on it as well.It is topped off with a Sun Optics 4-16x50mm scope with side paralax. Crystal clear and also has a 4 inch sunshade on. I have a woods 950 yards behind my house and was counting points on bucks from my house with it. It is a really good piece of glass. The Caldwell Bipod stays too. I have a slew of different rounds for this rifle for you to try and see what works best for you. There are just under 250 rounds total. V-max, hollow points, accutip, nosler, just to name a few. The 40 gr V-max have been my favorite and I have the most of that in this deal. If touch ups on the stock are needed I even have the paint for it.Overall I have had fun with this rifle but for coyote hunting and walking a lot it doesnt work for me. It is a varmint gun for driving around and setting up in one spot. Groundhogs HATE this thing!If you are not interested in the scope I would sell the rifle set up minus the scope for $450 (the scope is more than that but I'd like to make a deal soon).Please e-mail inquiries or text (419) 307-six six 02Thank you for looking"

In USPSA Production Division, CZ pistols are now used by twice as many top-level competitors than any other maker. Given that popularity, it was high time to up the ante. Starting from scratch, CZUB engineers took the best features of the original Shadow and improved upon them. More than two years later, we’re seeing the fruits of their efforts. With a higher beavertail and undercut trigger guard, the shooter’s hand is able to be as close to the bore axis as possible. With a contoured slide, the majority of the reciprocating mass is also centered on the bore, equating to less muzzle flip. Increased weight at the dust cover/rail also helps keep the muzzle down. The Shadow 2’s swappable mag release has an adjustable, extended button with three settings to allow shooters to set it in the spot most comfortable for them. Best of all, new trigger components give smooth DA and crisp, clean SA while drastically reducing trigger reset. A hardy nitride finish coats the entire pistol, leaving it nearly impervious to corrosion. Thin blue aluminum grips have healthy checkering to match the fine front and backstrap checkering of the pistol itself. Sitting atop the slide are a set of target sights — fiber optic on front and a serrated, black HAJO rear (click adjustable for elevation, drift adjustable for windage). Specifications: Chambering: 9mm Luger Magazine Capacity: 17+1 Frame: Steel Trigger Mech: SA/DA Sights: Fiber Optic front, HAJO rear Barrel: Cold Hammer Forged Barrel Length: 4.89 in Weight: 46.5 oz Overall Length: 8.53 in Safety: Ambidextrous Manual Safety"

The result is a pistol that delivers superior performance in durability and reliability, ergonomics, trigger, and modularity. Utilizing a removable, serialized chassis frame, the APX can be easily modified with replaceable grip frame housings and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Each APX comes with 3 interchangeable back straps so users can best fit their hands and preferences.

To accommodate right or left-handed use, the APX’s magazine release button can be easily reversed, and the slide stop is ambidextrous. The APX’s trigger breaks at 6lbs and has a clear tactile and audible very short reset. The APX truly is the ultimate striker fired pistol from Beretta.

I'm just kidding, if I see one more listing on here saying that I'm going to snap. I've shot over a thousand rounds through this gun and killed hundreds of dove. It works. However, last season it rained and I didn't clean it in time. There is superficial surface rust on the reciever you'll need to CLP to remove. Also, it doesn't like shooting Winchester or Remington shells. They are too tight in the receiver. It will cycle them mostly fine, but will hang up on every twentieth one or so. That means you gotta put two hands on the slide to rack it through. Annoying but never stopped me, just slowed me down. Maybe it needs polishing? It came from Academy so the stock is laminated wood and not real wood. I dont need a super mag but didn't realize this until after owning it for several years. Just selling so I can get a combat shotgun of some sort. Open to trades but prefer cash. Make me an offer, just a reasonable offer please. I'll put it in a vat of burning diesel fuel just to watch it burn before I deal with some yokel trying to get it for $200."

This rifle has a 20"" heavy barrel chambered in .308.  Shoots great, it will shoot sub moa (my best is .75""). Action is smooth and strong. It comes with a Nikko Sterling 4-16x44 scope(not the best but will get the job done), bipod, detachable 5rd magazine (also have the internal 5 round magazine).  Less than 300 rds through the rifle with proper break in and cleaning after shooting. Rifle is around $915 MSRP. I'm getting rid of it because I don't need two 308 bolt guns. Previous owner had a screw snap off on the base while installing the scope base and scope. The other 3 screws are torqued down and loctite applied. No movement and solid, but something you will need to take to a gunsmith to fix. There is one screw missing from the scope ring (again solid with no movement). **RELOADING COMPONENTS IN PICTURE ARE NOT INCLUDED**"
