It is a Taurus Pt111 millennium Gen2 9mm with two 12rd mags plus a brand new, quality ($70 at Academy Sports) and quickly detachable green laser. It attaches to the ""picatiny"" rail below the barrel that could be also be used for a light, laser, combo or any accessory.Accessories are all over the internet and even ebay... Decker pawn has some items if you don't like noise... Many guns have mags that fit this PT111 such as a Sig Sauer or Kel Tec meaning for 15 bux a 30 round mag works fine with it. Search youtube! You could put 2 drums on the damn thing if ya want!It's a very ""modify friendly"" and extremely reliable and accurate firearm! With a firm grip, a double tap will hit your mark twice because the recoil is admittedly, surprisingly. The best thing.about a 9mm in general js the ammo is cheap cheap cheap... And this gun IS NOT PICKY at all about what rype of ammo is used!The laser was just bought new as well. It cost me 70 bux at Academy sports. It is green and easily sighted for whatever distance you prefer. It has a 450 yard range!? I have the Taiurus box and the spare magazine exactly like the other 12 + 1 round magazine included. It is considered compact... And it is just slightly. But I have decided I want to get the very slim taurus 9mm for extreme concealed carry. But that gun is only a 7 round mag though, but it is supposed to be as reliable as this PT111. The PT111 is a truly reliable firearm that WILL NEVER FAIL YOU using ANY brand or type of 9mm ammo. I used a Walmart full metal jacket brass 50 round box that cost 9 bux. The night sights will put the bullet exactly where you sight it! With the laser, you could make a perfecr shot from... 50 to 100 yards guaranteed.Read about this gun on g[gle or YouTube. It is EXTREMELY reliable. With the accessory rail, it is ready for adding your choice of accessories to make it truly your own and undoubtedly your first line of defense. The gun is hard to find without ordering a seemingly great deal but having to wait 10 weeks for probably a non-factory tooled gun with a Taurus stamp.But I decided to give it up to get a slimmer 9mm for my waist. This pistol will fit only slightly noticable in my Jean pocket even with the laser. ***The picture I posted is THE REAL PISTOL (I HAVE MORE PICS BUT COULD ONLY UPLOAD ONE). It has a 3.2 inch barrel, 12 rounds, a laser that has a quick release as well as a small hex key that turns a single screw that sights it exactly for your preferred distance. The laser has hidden ""off"" button to avoid turning the laser on in your pocket for example. It is easily pushed without even looking to engage the laser as desired for your on/off control. I have it set for 15 yards. It is a NEW gun.Taurus let's you enter the serial number online and it tells the gun info such as manufactured date (2017) and all specs right on one page. It does not show transfers or owners! Only specs. Currently it is registered to me of course. Just consider it only has 50 rounds through it for qualifying for a cwp class. I had never shot it, and I aced the shooting test. Of course I had the laser popped off. I have the paperwork to show you I aced the test having never shot it. It's a double action pistol. ***After the last round, the slide remains locked back for extremely quick second inserting the next mag. You push a button and the empty mag falls on the ground. Pop the next mag in and click the slide release button and the slide moves forward which chambers the first round of the new mag. So ya keep on shooting without any hassle of rechambering the next magazine and bullet. This is a f**in one of a kind firearm. I wish I hadn't used it to qualify, so I could say it had never been shot. But on the other hand, I know first hand it is reliable, very comfortable in your hand with molded places where your thumb for example will be positioned, sweat resistant textured handle grip, has very typical yet minimal recoil for a 9mm, and dead on accuracy that is all it is said to be on the internet. You can modify this gun all you would like! :-) :-). I will throw in a new box of 50 rounds of 9mm.  *** Also, Taurus gives a lifetime warranty on their firearms. You won't need it, but any owner (not just the original purchaser) can send it to them to fix any problems. They have been known to send you a working firearm immediately and send your gun back when they fix whatever issue it has. People have ended up with 2 guns (I've heard). Taurus stands by their gun to the extent that if you have to send it off, they are concerned that you have no firearm due to a flaw that they are embarrassed it happened. I carry a Taurus PT 738 pocket rocket with an extended clip that was made in 2013. I thought it was new until I was paying for it and found out it was actually used! I'd put my life on the line with a 4 year old Taurus that stays in my pocket with extended and 2 extra mags. They make flawless guns. Don't let Taurus haters change your mind about this pt111!  You can use it as is, with a laser, or totally modified in any way you would like. It's ready to go! You'll love it. And it will sell fast. **All I require is a single page ""bill of sale"" for a legal South Carolina firearm sale. That means i need a form of government ID that has your name, ID number, address, and your signatures and verbal confirmation that you are not a felon... and you are not allowed to possess or own a firearm. You must tell me and sign that you are legally allowed to own a firearm. I will take a picture of your ID and you can do the same for mine. I do not do a background check, but I follow all laws for a legal sale/transfer of a gun in South Carolina. You must have an address on your government ID. That's all. So, this rare and sought after gun that I am selling only because I want to get a different Taurus that is very slim so I will fit inside my waist a little better than this so-called compact PT111. I always carry a Taurus revolver Judge somewhere on me for emergency. I love Taurus products. $300 plus tax 9mm in new in the box with the extra 12rd mag, keys for the extra child safety lock you'll never use lol, $70 plus tax green laser with quick release and small key to sight it for your preferred distance, box of 9mm ammo. Hmmm...  $350or best offer. You'll have it forever. Fits in Jean pocket. Modifiable to the extent you do to your fail proof 9mm! **Only serious legal buyers!! I can meet whenever!!"

The larger caliber is usually on the bottom for better ballance. These rifles are popular in the Austrian Alps where the same gun was used to hunt mountain chamois and the ground hogs/marmot that live there. Berg is mountain in German therefore the name Bergstutzen. This Bergstutzen in the caliber of 8x75 R-S and 5,6x52R is in mint condition. It was the dream of it's master gun maker Kurt Pritz of Mariapfarr, Austria. Mr. Pritz learned and developed his kraft in Ferlach. This rifle took three years to develope and contains 3 patents. It is a removeable sidelock system that has no pins or screws that show on the outside. This was done to keep moisture out and provide a flawless area for the best engravers. The soldered barrels were made of octagon steel and are very accurate.  The engraved Suhler claw mounts were added to mount the Zeiss anniversary Octagon scope 2.5-10 X 48. The magnificent engraving was done by the famous engraver Klaus Dieter Janc. The deep relief engraving is of  Red Stag in Rut on the left in a backround of pines with oak leaf edging. Right side is a charging eagle with a mother chamois protecting its young in a mountain backround and oak leaf edging. Bottom is a Roe Buck and Doe in a pine backround and oak leaf edging.  Fill for receiver, trigger guard and lever is Oak Leaf. The pistol grip, pistol grip cap and forend tip release are all eliquently engraved.  The entire stock and forarm are done with fish scale checkering and tasteful carving. The wood condition is also very good. It has a self cocker which allows the gun to be carried loaded without the danger of being fired accidently. This gun is a one of a kind. There are none like it any where."

The G43 is our new single stack, 9mm pistol. The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCKs history. The G43 is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It's ultra-concealable, accurate and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other GLOCK pistols.You can text me on (850) 800-0731 or contact me via e-mail if you are interested in buying."

The G43 is our new single stack, 9mm pistol. The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCKs history. The G43 is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It's ultra-concealable, accurate and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other GLOCK pistols.You can text me on (850) 800-0731 or contact me via e-mail if you are interested in buying."

When I purchased it it still had thr factory yellow grease in the internals and the bore, it came with a new 40rd pro mag but no original mag. I purchased and installed a new old stock original mag and I will include the new 40rd mag in this deal. As noted it is all mathing except magazine. It has a chrome line bore and chamber. This SKS is in 9.9/10 cond I picked it up a never fired it its just taking up tp much space for me and it has to go. Comes with sling and original cleaning kit in butt trap. The gas piston is chromed form the factory. The gas tube is very tight and not loose and rattling like most worn out sks. If you notice in the pictures the takedown lever has not worn out the bluing on the dustcover most sks will show a white streak from dessasembling alot. 99.99% bbluing this thing is almost unissued. The bayonet is chromed from the factory and it has its original cleaning rod. I'm asking $525 or best offer. I might be interestested in trading for other old military rifles or a old or modern pistol.  I'm located in Homestead, FL. If interested please call REDACTED thanks for looking"
