This is one of the ""tanker"" models and came from the factory in a spurless, double action only configuration. Intended for armor crews and other service members who had to operate in confined spaces. Finish has some honest service wear but the metal is solid with no rust or pitting. The bakelite grips are in good condition with the inset brass disc intact and lanyard ring both intact. The bore is excellent and the break action, latch, cylinder, and timing on the pistol are all very solid. All numbers on the frame, barrel, and cylinder are matching Only reason I'm selling is to cut down on the number of calibers in my collection. I also have around 50 rounds of Magtech .38S&W ammo that I'll throw in for free (I have two other boxes that I'll see for $25 each or both for $40). Price for the pistol and 50 rounds of ammo is $325 firm. I'm in the Saline/Ann Arbor area, so please be willing to meet there or within about 10 miles. Please have valid CCW or PP and driver's license and be willing to sign a very basic bill of sale (just name, contact number, and signature indicating you are legally allowed to purchase the gun).

That's it. Century Arms actually did very little work to this gun. Everything else is manufactured and assembled by the Zastava Arms factory in Serbia.  Be advised that this is a fairly heavy gun do to the thick 1.5mm stamped steel reciever fitted with a 'bulged' front trunnion (ala RPK) and the heavy barrel. Also, as most of you already know, this gun comes with a true double-stack bolt. The rifle has less than 200 rounds through it.The extra mags were purchased with the intention of modding my SKS rifles to take AK mags.

It's in GREAT condition with very few rounds downrange. I believe I'm the second owner and have only put 30 rounds down it myself. It has an HS Precision stock from the factory (which feels great), and a Vortex Viper 4-16x50 illuminated scope mounted (by Winchester Gallery gunsmith) with Vortex Precision rings. It also has a Caldwell bipod mounted. Rifle is smooth and accurate, I shot relatively well as an inexperienced long range shooter at 100 yards (through 30 rounds) including initial zero (from what I've heard about this caliber it shoots much better closer to 500-600 yards). I don't need to get rid of this, I really like this rifle, I'm just seeing what else is out there. I have 80 rounds of ammo, about 30 pieces of once-fired brass, and the rifle and scope. I would separate the rifle and scope, but will only sell the scope alone after the rifle has sold.
I have around $2,500 in this rifle as it sits:Rifle: $1,400Scope: $700Rings: $130Bipod: $50Ammo: $240~ (plus once fired brass @ about $1/round that I didn't include in this price)At this point I would prefer cash, but would consider trades for high end AR's (DD, Warsport, LWRC, LMT, Hodge etc...), Arsenal AK's, certain revolvers (686+ 6""...), multi-gun trades, stock Glock 9mm's, Scorpion Evo, etc... Just offer up with trades. I wouldn't expect to get $2500 if the offer is straight cash, so feel free to make me an offer within reason of what I have in it. Thanks!"

I'm looking to trade either one of the two for a Model 1911 in .45ACP of equal value. I'm only interested in the 1911 style .45ACP. The Colt has one pit on the barrel that has been arrested from progressing any further and I have been assured by my gunsmith that it can be repaired if you would want to have it done. The S & W has some loss of bluing on the cylinder. Other than the previously mentioned blemishes they both are in great condition. They both lock-up tight. If anyone is interested I can send photos via text message of whichever one you might be interested in. Use of FFL dealers will be required for any trade. I will also consider cash offers on either one of the two. The pics are of the Colt snubnose."
