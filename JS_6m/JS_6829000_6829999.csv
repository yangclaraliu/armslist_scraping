The bow is in excellent used condition. Come by and check it out. The Barnett RC-150 is truly unique in that it is sometimes regarded as the ideal crossbow for every situation. The RC-150 is powerful and accurate enough to satisfy the needs of the most experienced of hunters while being easily accessible to the humble target practice beginner. Hunters who need a crossbow with an adjustable rear stock, or a hunter who would rather carry a mere 5-3/4 pounds of crossbow will favor the RC-150 for any hunting trip. The traditional, proven straight limbs combined with the ""Veloci-Speed"" wheel, synthetic cable and string system provide up to 260 feet per second of hunting or target practice power.

It has the original inspection cartouche ""JSA 1899"" and an additional unit cartouche ""5th/1/E"" The unit cartouche, combined with the inspection date leads me to believe this rifle was carried by the 5th Infantry Regiment 1st Army Company E. The 5th Regiment served in the Philippine-American War in 1900 (well within the possible date range of this rifle) and earned one combat streamer for its service there. It is highly possible given these circumstances this rifle was involved in the effort to ""Civilize them with a Krag!"" This rifle represents both America's leaving the Monroe Doctrine behind and the beginnings of Her global superpower status. Serial No. 241444. bore is clean, action is smooth, absurd side magazine chambers rounds gracefully. The rifle is missing the rear sight but these can be easily aquired on Ebay for less than $45. Furthermore, given the US Army's policy of continuously updating the rear sight, I feel the overall value of the piece is not effected.Let me know if you would like to see more pictures. I understand the bare minimum are listed hereI am willing to ship assuming the buyer covers the costs with the understanding the rifle must go through an FFL."

A well designed 16 gauge is closer in weight to a 20 gauge, with a shot payload nearer the 12 gauge, and patterning that bests them both. Like its most revered predecessor, the Browning A5 16 gauge is built on a smaller, lighter receiver for reduced weight and a sleek feel in your hands. It also benefits from the advantages of Total Barrel Dynamics and the Invector-DS choke tube system to extract the most performance from this revered gauge. The humpback receiver profile increases the length of the sighting plane to give you the same advantage the first Auto 5s were famous for. Pick up an A5 Sweet Sixteen and see how sweet it is.You pay the transfer fee. My local guy charges $35.No shipping. No bullshit."

The Echo Trigger is a ground breaking drop in design that is approved by the ATF. The Echo Trigger allows the shooter to select from 3 different settings. Safe Mode: Firearm will not fire. Semi-Automatic Mode: Firearm fires when trigger is pulled. Echo Mode: Firearm fires when trigger is pulled and also when trigger is released.

Dillon Extra large Vibratory Case Cleaner and Extra large Case/Media Separator. Priced to sell at less than 1/2 full retail price for both.  Dillon's Vibratory Case Cleaner is the largest in the industry. Its 12-1/2 quart bowl capacity will allow you to polish up to 1,300 .38/.357 or 550 .30-06 cases per hour. Not only is our capacity greater, but our motor is larger in horse power, internally cooled, thermally protected, and turns on precision ball bearings. This is no ""hobby"" machine! The bowl and base are constructed of 7/32"" thick injection molded high-strength polypropylene which is impact and abrasion resistant. All the electrical/electronic components of Dillon equipment are covered by a one-year warranty from date of purchase. This unit is designed for dry media only.  Dillon knew from the beginning that the simplest method of separating cleaned cases from the cleaning media would be a rotating squirrel cage, but they had to find a design they could manufacture economically. The problem was that it had to be BIG -- big enough to handle the entire load of the FL-2000-series case cleaners.  The solution was an injection molded reversible part. Simple, and it works great. The CM-2000 Case/Media Separator is large, 10"" x 14"", and will hold more than 1,600 .38 Special cases. It sits on a large media collection tub that measures 18"" x 22"". The tub keeps the mess off the floor and bench. It's fast -- so fast it will remove media from 1500 rounds of .223 brass in a matter of seconds.  Located is Superior near Flatiron Crossing Mall (off of US36, the Denver/Boulder turnpike)."
