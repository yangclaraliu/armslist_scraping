This is the 'Dark' ELITE model which means that it is the all black model, not stainless. These ELITE series of the P226 have an ENORMOUS amount of higher upgrades and modifications than the usual Sig P226's, such as the Short-Reset-Trigger (SRT) that provides you with the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable 60% shorter travel on the trigger reset for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. This is just one of the MANY upgrades in the ELITE series of the P226, like having the SRT Trigger-System, all corrosion-resistant internal mechanisms, enhanced ergonomics, supreme accuracy, etc.. As you can see from the pictures, my Sig P226 ELITE 9mm is in IMMACULATE condition and probably one of the most beautiful pistols I have ever seen. It will of course come with the original Sig Sauer hard-case that is double-lockable, as well as the owner's manual, paperwork, and both magazines. You can also easily see that BOTH the barrel and the chamber area are completely SPOTLESS and shining bright like new! Also, both the front & rear sights have been installed with raised and serrated Tritium HD-Glow NEON Night Sights that are EXTREMELY bright at night-time, and even so during the day as well, as the pictures show! This is also the MOST accurate 9mm pistol I have EVER shot! It easily out shot and was more accurate at 25yards than my Glock 17, but even all the way out up towards 40-50yards this ELITE P226 was still more accurate and had closer groupings than my H&K VP-9 and Beretta M-9! I hate to get rid of it but I already have a few 9mm's and this one I never take out of the safe because of its beauty!"

It comes with everything pictured, including the extra tanto blade. There are a few small scuffs on the handle that are completely cosmetic and do not affect the function at all. This has been a great knife for anyone looking to get into OTF knives but don't feel like shelling out $300-$400 for a benchmade infidel or microtech.  RavenCrest is an outstanding company that will absolutlely stand behind their product with their lifetime warranty. Additionally, if you don't feel like sharpening your RavenCrest, you can send it in to them and they'll sharpen it for free. If you don't believe me, you can check out any of the many stellar reviews for this specific knife or RavenCrest as a whole. The only reason I'm selling is to fund the purchasing of either a manual flipper or any of the benchmade 940 models of knives, so those are really the only things I'd be willing to trade for. Asking price is $125, which including the additional blade, I believe is a pretty resonable price. If you would like additional pictures, let me know and I can text or email them to you whichever you prefer. Thanks for looking, by text would be the best way to contact me @919-8two5-521five."

Caliber is 8mm Mauser also known as 8x57 and 7.92x57. This rifle was originally sporterized and it was all matching in that configuration except for the bolt. The bolt has an ""af"" suffix which is Waffenfabrik Brunn made in wartime Czechoslovakia. The original stock and rear sight were cut up. I replaced it with an later Gustloff Werke made laminate stock. I have the original matching flat butt plate with original screws if you choose to look hard for the correct walnut stock with flat butt. Band is Mauser made, and rear sight base Gustloff Werke made. Not Russian Capture, No import marks, I belive this was a vet bringback, I don't know the history of the stock. Facts:""1"" for Gustloff Werke are on lower reciever frame, floorplate, magazine follower and rear sight base.Four digit serial with maching reciever and barrel.  Comes with matching buttplate.All internal parts, reciever, barrel, sight are matching.Great for reenacting!  Please contact me for more pictures if you are interested.  Thank You$750.00  Looking for a quick sale to pay some bills."

(Which I would include).  The seller and myself knew nothing about this pistol and after doing extensive research, I found out it's true value.  If you were to look at Gunbroker.com, Gunsamerica.com or Blue Book Values, you would see these go for anywhere between $375-$600+ depending on condition.  The original mags alone cost $150-$200 now.  This pistol is now a fully authenticated 1941 Femaru Model 37M with the addition of the original mag.I am a shooter, not a collector and I shoot regularly at the range.  After finding out the value of this pistol, I do not take this to the range anymore.  Naturally, it has been test fired and broken down and cleaned extensively.  I have a host of pistols and I do not need this lying around.  I put the condition of this pistol on the high side of 'good'.  I am mainly looking to get back out of this what I have put into it.The pistol was designed by Frommer, a prominent Hungarian gun manufacturer who produced quality weapons for the Hungarian Army.  It is styled after the proven design of the Colt 1911 as most manufacturers did and still do.  This pistol was made in Budapest, Hungary in 1941 and used by the Hungarian Army until Nazi Germany occupied Hungary and renamed it 'Pistole 37(u)', the lower case 'u' used to signify their Hungarian origins.As you can see from the photo's showing the serial # and the dates of manufacture, this pistol is over 75 years old.  The caliber was referred to as 9mm Kurz(European), which converts to .380acp.The barrel is interchangeable with the 7.65mm (.32acp) as is the mag.  The 7.65 was produced by Femaru for the German Luftwaffe and an additional safety was installed at the rear of the slide.  The only safety on this original Femaru 37M is a grip safety.I could go on and on about the history of the manufacturer, etc., but my space is limited.  I also have many more photo's, but I'm only allowed 3 here.If you need further info, more photo's or more intense documentation, you can contact me through 'contact seller' at the top of the page or text me at REDACTED.  I am located in Spring Hill, FL. As a note, this pistol is remarkably accurate given it's fixed sights.I am asking $425 and will entertain a reasonable offer.  Cashiers check only, no CC.  I do not want trades.  Receipt will be given.  You would be responsible for the cost of shipping, FFL fees to your FFL, etc."

This firearm features a delayed gas blowback system to allow it to be a very flat shooter, it is claimed to shoot 30% flater than its modern semi auto pistols counterparts. The CCP's slide works off of a gas piston that propels the slide forward when shot, allowing for Walther to implement a lighter recoil spring. This spring is so light a petite female could rack it with 2 fingers and it still has the same reliability as a Glock. This is one of the best single stack 9 mm on the market. This firearm comes with a thumb safty, 2 magazines, etc. It features a stainless steel slide which allows for a nice 2 tone effect.Looking to sell for 400 because this gun is brand new.

It comes with everything pictured, including the extra tanto blade. There are a few small scuffs on the handle that are completely cosmetic and do not affect the function at all. This has been a great knife for anyone looking to get into OTF knives but don't feel like shelling out $300-$400 for a benchmade infidel or microtech.  RavenCrest is an outstanding company that will absolutlely stand behind their product with their lifetime warranty. Additionally, if you don't feel like sharpening your RavenCrest, you can send it in to them and they'll sharpen it for free. If you don't believe me, you can check out any of the many stellar reviews for this specific knife or RavenCrest as a whole. The only reason I'm selling is to fund the purchasing of either a manual flipper or any of the benchmade 940 models of knives, so those are really the only things I'd be willing to trade for. Asking price is $125, which including the additional blade, I believe is a pretty resonable price. If you would like additional pictures, let me know and I can text or email them to you whichever you prefer. Thanks for looking, by text would be the best way to contact me @919-8two5-521five."

Pmag.  This is a new unfired rifle that I never got around to doing anything with because of other projects.  I chose this particular AR-10 because I wanted a bit more range than a 16"" barrel would give and the medium contour barrel keeps the rifle as light as possible without compromising accuracy.  After looking over lots of ballistic data I saw no reason to go with a 20"" barrel, IMO the gain in velocity was simply not worth the extra length and weight.  Again, the rifle is new but it was purchased around three years ago, the only one I could find currently listed was one on Gunbroker for $1,650 in the same stock configuration.  I do have aftermarket pistol grips and stocks I can add for a little extra, just let me know.
$1,300 firm in cash or better in trade, not going to straight trade on something I can buy for hundreds less, sorry.  This one cost well over $1,500 after tax and it's still new.  
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and shorter in 9mm and .45 ACP and cash or??  If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.  If you don't mention cash or other either way, I will assume you want a straight trade.
