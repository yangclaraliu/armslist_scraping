This includes 2 factory 7rnd magazines, dual mag carrier, holster, cleaning brush, tool kit, and manual. I also changed the two piece guide rod to a Wilson Combat one piece so the original (unused) is included as well. This model does have Trijicon night sights. I also have 150 rounds of ammunition and if you are a reloader the approximately 140 rounds of once fired brass. I am NOT looking for trades and cash only.

Antique John Buckingham side by side shotgun for sale. Made by Henry Pieper in Belgium, Circa 1875-1883 per the proof marks. All numbers matching (receiver, barrel and handgaurd, I have not tore the receiver down to check those numbers). Condition 85-95% very good. Hammers, triggers and firing pins are all free and operate, barrel is NOT pitted or rusty. Has a laminated steel barrel, checkered stock and engraving in the hammer plates. A 12 gauge shell fits slightly loose in the barrels, so I believe this to be a 10 gauge. This appears to have never been refinished. $850 OBO There is no actual manufacturer listed on Armslist so I used Benelli for this posting. Another gun I took in on trade... This is an old (Ithaca) SKB 12 gauge semi automatic, Full choke, vented ribbed 28"" barrel, 2 3/4 shells. There is an engraved pheasant scene on one side of the receiver and an engraved duck scene on the other. Action works fine, but I have not shot this (just got it yesterday) There is a small crack in the stock that can easily be repaired (I don't think it would affect shooting), or simply replace the stock. Parts are available still for this model. Blueing is at around 85-90% in my opinion. Gunbroker has these listed in the 475.00 range, I am asking $325.00 OBO due to the stock.

Austin.  Shipping may be possible, at additional cost.  Thank you.For those unfamiliar with the 597, it is a much newer & more modern design than its main competitor, the Ruger 10/22 (1997 versus 1964).  The stock seems to be designed more for adults, with a more pronounced pistol grip.  The bolt rides smoother on two tool-steel guide rods (versus one on the Ruger), and there is a last shot bolt hold open feature.  The 597 is considered by many shooters to be more accurate out of the box than the 10/22."

Magazine was used for test fire. Made in Belgium, it was manufactured in 1964. Very nice finish with a touch of holster rub at the tip of the barrel. There is light freckling on the surface of the ribs and around the under frame and grip area, otherwise the bluing shows very nice for its age.  Handgun comes with one magazine, but factory new makes for a nice combo. Gold trigger and a full length black leather holster complete the outfit.  I can email an electronic owners guide to buyer.  Also additional photos can be e-mailed upon request.  Buyer pays transfer fee."

General Specs: Ithaca, Year 1936, 28 Gauge, 5lb 15oz, Side-by-Side   Serial Number: 461325   For any serious shooter/collector, the small-bore Classic American Doubles are the pinnacle of desirability. They are few in numbers and high in cost. When it comes to the 28ga. only two of the Classic American double gun producers come into play; Parker and Ithaca. As most who seek these small bores are aware, the Parker guns are very costly in 28ga. as only a handful of them were produced. The Ithaca NID is an awesome gun with brilliant mechanics, super-strong receiver, and its affordable cost. This Ithaca NID Grade 2E, sn461325 made in 1936, is exceptionally rare as it is 1 of 58 total production of all Ithaca NID 28ga. Grade 2’s. Keep in mind there are likely less than 10 of the 58 that were produced with the ultra-desirable beavertail forend, Ithaca Single Selective trigger, and ejectors, SO THIS GUN IS VERY RARE INDEED! Even more importantly, the gun retains 65% vivid factory original case color, 98% factory blue, all factory original wood with a perfect oil finish, no cracks or repairs, clear sharp Grade 2 engraving, all in a 6lb. package with perfect mechanics. If you try and compare this gun to Parker’s Grade 2 gun, or GHE grade, the price of the Parker with these features and factory condition would cost twice as much as the Ithaca. Ithaca NID small bore guns represent the very best value in today’s shooter/collector market with relatively low cost that will surely increase the most in value during the next 5 years. The mechanics are perfect inside and out, bores are mirrors, no splits or cracks anywhere, excellent screws, barrels are tight on breech face and hinge pin with lever well right of center. The 26” barrels are choked at IC/M (.004/.013 constrictions) making it the ultimate upland bird gun as well as a fun gun to shoot pee-wee competition at the vintage side x side shoots. What a great piece of American gun art that is just as fun to shoot today as it was 80 years ago. Thanks for looking!

I'd like to get a SKS and I'll pay transfer but I doubt I'd get that. Lol. I paid about $300 for the Tiger and used it a few times. 500 rounds total through it. Only thing I can add on the trade is a hand made machete from Brazil made from 1060 carbon steel I believe. I forget. Maybe 1045. Have only 50 rounds of ammo. I'd throw a 45lb bow in but not sure if I want to get rid of it. Looks kinda like pic I'm uploading but Blacker. Even if you have a .22 M1 carbine or something like that lmk.
