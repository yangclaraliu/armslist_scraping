Purchased last year new, has less than 400 rounds put through it. Selling because I don't take it out all that much, and have no real intention of ever using it as a handgun. I think this is fantastic gun, no matter who you are or how your day has been, your face lights up with a **I miss Obama**-eating grin from the moment you first pull that trigger.Interesting design behind it, at first it looks like a blocky 1911, but upon closer inspection it appears a 1911 and Browning Hi-power had a baby. Magazines take some finesse to load, but once mastered, is just as easy as any single stack out there.Comes with three 6-round magazines, soft case, oil specifically called out by Coonan for maintenance, gun lock, and magazine loading assist pin. Gun features Novak white three-dot sights, has light walnut grips, and has an unpolished stainless finish. Was sent off to Coonan a few months ago to have some work done, slide was not locking back after last round in the magazine. issue seems to have been fixed, has not had the issue since I've shot it after getting it back from Coonan.Purchase will also include 600+ rounds of Armscor 125gr .357 magnum ammunition. Unsure on exact amount, will update later. Will add pictures later after I'm done with work.Not terribly interesting in trades, looking more to sell outright. Asking $1800. Toss me a trade offer, worst I can do is say no. Thanks for looking."

This is a premium Noveske AR pistol platform. Only reason i'm seilling is that I just do not have time to shoot it. Here are the details on it.If you have your own optics, I can do it a little cheaper.As title implies this is a NOVESKE AR in pistol format. (N-4). It has the ""Flaming Pig"" flash suppressor, Sig pistol brace, Timney trigger that is right around 3 1/2 to 4 pound pull & smooth as butter.. The barrel is double chrome lined and bead blasted on the outside. It has VLTOR handguard & KNS  trigger/hammer pins... also comes with an Aimpoint red dot and Primary Arms 3x magnifier that swings out to the side for close in shots. It has a really nice all weather hard case, 2 magpul mags and another 30 rounder..so 3 mags in all. Included also is the manual..which is not in the pictures. I have shot 20 rounds through this weapon to sight it in. Needless to say, it is a tack driver..literally! I didnt mesure but it looked like one ragged hole at 50 yards..roughly i'd say 1/2 inch MOA. This Noveske is top notch..as im sure you know if your into the AR platform. I have over 2,500 in this setup..I would sell for 1400 without the optics, if you have your own.  I would ask to see your Tn. drivers license and/or Tn. handgun permit. Thanks for looking.."

This rifle has pitting throughout the exterior of barrel and frame, but rifle is shootable. The wood is dark from age, the forearm has a small crack on front right edge, and a small breakout on left front edge from years ago, there is also a small crack on right side at back of tang where stock joins, cracks would be an easy repair. The other rifle is a J. Stevens Pat. 1894 chambered in .22 Long Rifle, with 22"" barrel octagon from forearm to frame, round from forearm forward. Metal on this rifle is in much better shape ! has some minor pitting and scratches typical of what you would se in a 100+ year old gun. There is a pivot pin missing out of frame, but rifle will cycle. No issues with wood on this one ! I have done nothing to these, but bring them home, They could use a good scrubbing and some TLC."

Don't go to them, sell to me for more. If you have a current offer, shoot it my way, I bet I can offer you a better deal. Only legitimate offers. What I mean is? If you took your firearm for a legitimate trade in value or sell back type store, I can offer you more. They need to buy low to sell for profit, I buy at fair prices to both myself and seller, I show you what market value is and what real auction result prices are and then I offer you a price according to the market.No low balling, I make offers according to the quality and purchase value of your gun.Thanks for your time, look forward to buying your firearms :) To more ammo and freedom,-Firm Grip"

This is not a toy gun.  It may fire .22lr but it has the feel of a real UZI. Bought this for my kids to shoot but they aren't interested.  This is used and shows sign of being used.  It has scuffs on the paint finish but functions just fine with any ammo I've run through it.  It comes with what I believe is one 20 round factory magazine.  I'm looking for $250.  Please no lowball offers.  All laws apply to private transfer or transfer at FFL at your cost. I am updating this ad to include I will entertain trades.  I would ideally like something for my kids to shoot, something like a 10-22, also consider a Hi-point carbine rifle, AR-15 pistol upper, or even a M&P 15-22 with a little cash on my end..."
