I have had the firearm in my safe since purchasing with the only change being that I acquired the KSA 4x32 cricket scope for the rifle. I have all original packaging, manuals, etc for the rifle as well as the scope. This would be a great rifle for teaching a little one firearm safety and how to use a rifle, or even a fun gun for plinking, however I don't have the space to hold on to it long enough for my little one to get use of it and I need more space in my safe."

This is the more desirable heel stamped model (like an M1 Garand). It is in a synthetic stock but comes with an extra wood (walnut?) stock. It comes with 8 20 round magazines: 4 USGI marked BRW S-I (correct weld spots and latch plate holes as far as I can tell) and 4 unknown manufacturer (I looked these up and they look like Norinco mags but IDK for sure). Also included is a 1st gen Springfield Armory scope mount. The internals are in excellent shape and the chrome-lined barrel is shiny as it should be. It is a great shooter as it sits or it would make an excellent base for a clone build or match rifle given the correct forged receiver. I have put less than 100 rounds through it but I am not the original owner so I don't know the actual round count. It functioned as it should through the few rounds I've put through it. It doesn't have any USGI parts other than the stock as far as I can tell.The M14 itself is valued at $1000 given that it is the more desirable heel stamped model, not side stamped. The mags are $35 each for the USGI (4x35=$140) and $20 each for the Norinco (4x20=$80). The Springfield Armory scope mount is valued at $60. The extra wood (walnut?) stock is around $40. Total trade value is $1320. I will not separate this package. Communication through Email is preferred. I can text if necessary. Absolutely no calls.You must be willing to meet me in the Tri-Cities area.I will not ship. Please don't ask.If this ad is up, it's still available.Thanks for reading."

Night sights are factory nibx coated, not the pistol. Has factory glock extended release, custom aluminum backplate (blank) and the x-grip insert for the kriss vector 28 round magazine which uses the factory glock 21 top shell. Look it up on Google if you're unaware. It's bad ass with 28 rounds of .45acp that fits with a factory glock mag top. It also comes with 3 x 10 round magazines, they only come with 2 from factory. Includes a Galco leather mag pouch as well. One has the pierce pinky extension. INTERNAL PARTS ARE FACTORY UNTOUCHED, EXCEPT FOR A Glock factory  (-) minus connector. Nothing else was touched. I also have original glock connector and slode release as well. Has less than 250 round's through it and barrel barely shows any use. Comes with a Gould and Goodrich g30 IWB holster which is in excellent condition, and 120 rounds of mix premium ammo including federal hydroshocks, Hornandy polymer insert hollow points and speer lawman. This was my shtf, and daily carry and is the baddest turnkey package you'll find. It's like a .45acp AR in the palm of your hand. Now lowballs please.
