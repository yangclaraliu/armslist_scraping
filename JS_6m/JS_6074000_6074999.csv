The manufacture year on the the box is 2012. It has some holster wear as can be seen in the photos. I upgraded the grips to E2 grips because with the high thumbs grip they were much more comfortable to me. Since these photos were take the e2 grips have been replaced with new ones so the condition in the photos do not accurately reflect the condition of the grips. They are very grippy being new. The original grips are included in this sale. The gun is in flawless mechanical condition and has less than 1000 rounds fired. The trigger pull is very good with the double action pull breaking perfectly with no overtravel. This particular model has a chrome lined barrel. I was under the impression when I purchased the gun that all the MK25 models came with a chromed barrel. I have learned since then that this is not the case and that the chromed barrel is somewhat rare in the MK25 models. I have 5 mecgar 18 round magazines in addition to the three 15 round mags that came with the gun. I also have two holsters for it one is a bladetech kydex and one is a Don Hume leather. I also have a bladetech kydex magzine flashlight holder the flashlight it fits is a surefire P6. Sale is for the Gun only and the magazines grips(including the e2 upgrade) and box that came with the gun originally. I will include the 5 extra mags the holsters and the mag/light holder only if the buyer agrees to pay $850. If you have any questions don't hesistate to contact me. I have invested in all this about $1200. Thanks for looking.  Willing to ship out of area to FFL dealer.

Available in .338 Lapua Magnum, .338 Norma Magnum, .300 Norma Magnum, .300 Winchester Magnum, .308 Winchester, 7mm Remington Magnum, .260 Remington and 6.5 Creedmoor, the precision grade barrel can be removed by simply loosening two bolts using a standard Torx wrench.

It is a very interesting pistol with one handed cocking. Overall condition of the handgun is typical for most of the jo-lo-ar's in the country. Many of these came from Peru, where they saw service with their mounted police. Despite the outwards appearance of the pistol, the bore is in great shape, and still shiny. I have test fired it and it has a few issues. With the CCI ammo it sometimes fails to cock the hammer and stovepipes occasionally. I don't know if these issues are from the ammo or the gun itself. The recoil also sometimes causes the magazine release to tempoarlrily unlatch and the magazine to drop slightly(I think the mag release spring may be weak). Might make a good project for someone looking for something to fix.Comes with 1 magazine."

The Model 700™ Mountain Rifle's clean, classic stock design, with straight-line comb angled slightly downward towards the muzzle and sculptured cheek piece on the left side is a style still favored by many custom stockmakers. The gracefully-tapered 22-inch barrel without sights produces a rifle capable of handling mountain-level ranges without draining the hunter's energy to get there. The barreled action is produced from 416A stainless steel and is set in a handsome, elements-resistant, satin-finished, brown two-tone laminated stock. Other features include crisp cut checkering, black fore-end tip and grip cap, and hinged floorplate magazine. • Slim 22"" mountain contour barrel to reduce weight Hinged floor plate magazine • Receiver machined from solid-steel bar stock resulting in uniformity and strength • Cylindrical receiver design provides a solid bedding area in the stock for consistent shot placement • Recessed bolt face locks up inside the counter-bored breech of the barrel which is surrounded by the receiver, forming ""three-rings-of-steel"" enclosing the cartridge case head for unparalleled strength • Integral extractor is set in a groove inside the rim of the bolt face, uniformly supporting the cartridge head Caliber: 7mm-08 Springfield Average Weight: 6.625 Barrel Length = 22"" Overall Length = 42 1/2""1 Twist = 10"" Status: Discontinued Model-No Longer In Production  Year made 2004.  Bi-pod not included.

Built on the same standard as the RPK style machine guns, Vepr is 50% more reinforced than a standard, stamped AK rifle. Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel.

Vepr in .308 Win. caliber features a look similar to an AK, with a thumbhole buttstock and walnut foregrip. The hammer forged, chrome lined barrel, and a scope rail is riveted to the side of the receiver for easy mounting of a side scope.

Each rifle comes with high quality, beautifully crafted walnut furniture as well as a rear sight with adjustable windage.

It began production in 1989 and is a relatively conventional short recoil Browning-style-locking pistol. What makes it unique is the trigger. It can be fired in single action, double action and a third action called Fast Action (also called Triple Action or Double Action Plus+). In this third action the trigger has the same length of pull as double action but the trigger weight is the same as single action, giving some of the safety of double action with the accuracy benefits of single action."
