Front cocking serrations provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm, or conducting press checks. They also feature a low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc.

No offense to you, but I will probably not be interested in trading for your AR-10 or other 308/762nato rifle because I'm extremely picky and I like premium parts for my builds. So if you're looking for an AR-15 that has some of the best quality made parts on the market with price in mind; this gun is for you. I removed the stock, the scope, the bipod, and the pistol grip that I originally had on it because I plan on using them on my AR-10 build. This gun does not come with a butt stock, everyone has their own taste in AR furniture so I have left this one ready for your own customization. It is accurate, reliable, and the muzzle brake on it greatly reduces felt recoil. All parts on the gun are in new to like-new condition and have no wear/damage. I have run 60 rounds of match ammo through the gun and it has functioned flawlessly. Headspace was checked with Clymer ""Go"" and ""No-Go"" gauges. This gun is ready to go!

It is much better than the original version. Many use the Ruger takedown as their under the seat, camping, backpacking, bug out, etc.. riffle and prefer not to have the bright red Ruger logo on the outside. In addition, the original bag was just long enough for the riffle halves and mad it very difficult to mount a scope on the riffle and still have it fit in the bag. This one is larger so a scope can be mounted easily, is flatter so it can be packed more easily in a duffle bag or under a truck seat. Also, the straps that hold everything in place are attached with Velcro so the storage can be completely customized to your needs.This is a RARE find so don't miss out! There is not another Ruger takedown bag on Armslist or Ebay like this one.I will sell for $60.00 plus $16.95 shipping.Payments are via PayPal. Please email me with any questions that you have.MSRP: $79.95"

These were a limited run to experiment with CZ-75 B features. The only reason I am selling this is I thought it would be a cool project with the menorah, but before I did anything to it other than change the recoil spring for a new one, I contacted Scott at Cajun Gun Works, who builds custom CZs. He told me this one was too cool to customize - he hadn't seen one with B features made this early, nor one of these Israeli market special editions (Please feel free to verify independently, he'll remember the guy who asked him about the massada recoil springs)I would be able to provide you with the receipt and documentation (they sell a lot of Israeli stuff on Gunbroker) from the importer, showing the direct chain of custody from Israel. Since this gun lacks an import stamp, that will certainly be useful to maintain the provenance. Comes with 3 14 round Mec-Gar mags. FTF only."
