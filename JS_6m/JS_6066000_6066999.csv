Its a rural area, the old guy running the shop knows the elderly man who owned it, who never used it, and was gotten from the original buyer. Sat put away at the shop for a while until the son took over and such guns needed to be on the books. The bluing is 100%, cylinder pawl still has sharp edges from lack of use, just the faintest of a line around the cyl. Bore is still clean. Its more rare 6in barrel version.

This pistol has had about 50 rounds through it for test fire and confirmation of hollow point feeding. Here is what is being offered:Smith & Wesson M&P 40C Pistol with Factory Night SightsTotal of 3 10 round compact S&W factory magazines with pinky extensions3 S&W 15 round factory magazinesBox, Papers, and all 3 backstraps (not shown in photo but I have them)Storm Lake Drop-In Barrel in .357 SIG, instantly gives you a second caliber.I have been using this as my dedicated home defense gun, but I also have the same pistol in 9mm and don't really need both. I found this to be an excellent pistol, and when the 15 round magazines are used, it shoots just like a full-sized gun. This could be the only defense handgun you will ever need. The factory night sights are a $125 option if you were to order them on the gun. If necessary, I can arrange a concealment holster and some ammo to go with the package for the right deal.
Price for the package is $600 cash only. I will consider full or partial trades for high quality handguns at trade value. I am looking for a full-sized 1911, but no off-brands please. I also like classic Smith and Wesson revolvers. If you are serious and need more photos I am happy to take more. There are no flaws or marks on the pistol.Transaction will take place at my office in Homestead, please bring ID which you will give me a copy of, and I will do the same for you with a Bill of Sale."

It is outfitted with a later style 1892 stock (it has no clearing rod on the left side and has the side bar sling attachment). Originally, an 1890 would have thin sights, which were later updated to the larger ""block"" sights. In 1916, the 5 shot magazines and handcuffs were added to existing 1892 carbines. These are French designated ""Artillery Carbine 1892 modified 1916"" (irrelevant to how the receiver is marked). In 1927, your carbine would have had its stock replaced/repaired to have its clearing rod removed and the channel in which it sat filled, and the front barrel band replaced with one that had a stacking quillion. In 1932, you carbine had its chamber reamed out to accept Balle N ammunition."

I am the first owner and have only shot one magazine of HP and one magazine of FMJ through it, been a safe queen for the last year or so. It is a great gun for home defense or EDC, but I don't really shoot .40 S&W any more and have moved on to other interests, but I think it's a shame this one just sits in the safe. Deal includes two 15 round magazines, original Ruger box, owner's manual, Ruger handgun lock and magazine loading assist tool. I will also throw in a couple of mags of Hornady hollow-points and half a box of FMJ rounds and the nylon Blackhawk! Holster that I have kept it in. Gun has never had a malfunction of any sort, mags work great and cleaned after every use. Fully ambidextrous controls and the back grip is reversible from a straight grip to a contoured grip by removing a pin at base of gun. Feeds hollow-points and FMJ equally well. Buyer must present valid NC Handgun Purchase Permit and valid ID."
