I never intended to sell this rifle but I decided to part ways becuase I have plenty AR15s and I want to build a new, high quality hunting rifle. With that being said, I am not desperate to sell and I don't have to sell it. Don't really want too but my safe is really full and I dont want to buy a bigger safe until after I move so I have to make room before adding another. Its got about 200 rounds through it and shoots absolutley fantastic. The gun comes as pictured. It will come with a 40 round gen3 pmag. Buyer must be a Texas resident and willing to sign a bill of sale. Gun would cost you 1560 dollars to build before taxes, transfer fees, and gunsmithing fees if you cant do that yourself. After taxes and transfer fees theres approximatley 1750 in this rifle. Selling for 1100 FIRM. Absolutley non-negotiable. More than fair for a quality built rifle. All it needs is a nice optic or some flip ups. Would make a great Christmas gift! Will only trade for glock 19 gen 4 with 3 mags, box, and backstraps at minimum plus 700 dollars.

Its a complete full custom rifle by RW Hart of Nescopeck, PA. Bobby Hart is a 1986 World Open champ and teaches the FBI snipers about long range shooting. The action is a fully blueprinted stainless Remington 700 action. The trigger is a hart that breaks at 2 pounds. It has a 28 inch stainless diamond Hart 1-10 twist barrel. It's sitting in a competitive edge gunworks chassis and the barrel is free-floating. Scope in picture is not included as it has already sold. The caliber is 30 Hart which is a 300 Weatherby with a 40 degree Ackley shoulder with a 300 Winchester neck. It was originally designed as a 1000 yard benchrest round before the big 300 magnums came on the scene, but it really makes a nice ultra-long range hunting round. The case capacity of the 30 Hart is right in the middle between a 300 Weatherby and a 300 RUM. Cases are made fire-forming 300 Weatherby as this round can be used in the gun as well. Gun costs I have dies that go along with the rifle as well. I have too many custom rifles and I've only hunted with it once as I just don't hunt anywhere that demands the long range accuracy this is capable of. 80 rounds down the pipe. Obviously this is a specialty item that needs to find the right owner so I'm open to all reasonable offers and trades. You'll need to have your FFL send me a copy of their license to ship it. Thanks for looking. $3,000 buys it. I'm located in Dixon, MO"

Extensively tested during its development, the AR-556 is constructed from top-quality components, including forged 7075-T6 aluminum upper and lower receivers and a cold hammer-forged chrome-moly steel barrel with M4 feed ramp cuts.Chambered in 5.56 NATO, the AR-556’s carbine-length, flat-top, M4 design is fully configured with a Ruger Rapid Deploy folding rear sight, milled F-height gas block with post front sight, forward assist, dust cover, brass deflector, telescoping six-position stock, improved trigger-reach grip, enlarged trigger guard and one 30-round Magpul PMag. Standardized M4/AR components are utilized throughout, so the AR-556 can be customized easily.AR-556 FeaturesWindage Adjustable Ruger Rapid Deploy Rear Sight: The Ruger Rapid Deploy folding rear sight provides windage adjustability, and is a solid, reliable aiming system when coupled with the elevation adjustable front sight. The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics but can be instantly redeployed if needed.Forged 7075-T6 Aluminum Upper Receiver: Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.Shot Peened, 9310 Alloy Steel Bolt: The bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability.Patent Pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring: The patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired.Elevation Adjustable Front Sight: The front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A-2 Style F-Height allows co-witness with many optics.Medium Contour Cold Hammer-Forged Barrel: The 16.10 inch medium contour barrel is cold hammer-forged providing ultra-precise rifling for exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8 twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.Single Stage Trigger and Enlarged Trigger Guard: The single stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow for gloved shooting.Matte Black Oxide Bolt Carrier with Staked Gas Key: The chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.Serrated Face Milled Gas Block: The milled gas block is located at a carbine length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface.Firearm SpecificationsManufacturer: RugerModel: AR-556Model Number: 8500Caliber: 5.56 NATOWeight: 6.50 lbs.Length: 32.25 - 35.50 in.Length of Pull: 10.25 - 13.50 in.Width: 2.50 in.Height: 8.00 in.

Some say the best single action handgun ever made. Low round count like most large caliber handguns. Beautiful bluing unlike newer guns.  Outstanding triger and very, very accurate. Pachmayr grips. I have hit clay pigeons at 100 yards with standard shelf ammo. This is a heavier frame Blackhawk and really tames the recoil of the very hottest loads with the extra weight and pachmayr grips. Would be a great hunter for deer, hogs, and bear. Also shoots very mild .44 Special loads with the recoil of less than a .38 special. It would make a great all around hand gun for everything but concealed carry. I also have lots of ammo. 5 full new boxes of premium Underwood .44 mag. ammo( better than Garret or Buffalo Bore in my opinion), and 125  rounds of Winchester and American Eagle in 240 grain FMJ and Metal jacket with led hollow points and soft points. Also have 38 rounds of Winchester .44 Special Cowboy loads. Also have Lee Delux .44 MAG/Special dies and Lee sizing dies alomg with 150 Hornady 300 grain XTP bullets, 60 flat nose lead bullets, 380 new quality brass shells and 100 new nickel shells 480 total loading shells. Buyer gets to make offer for the ammo and loading components for buying the revolver. I will sell the Blackhawk without the ammo and loading components, but will not sell them untill the revolver is gone if the buyer isn't interested in buying it with the Blackhawk.  With the Underwood loads I have cronoed nearly 1600 fps with 340 grain loads due to the longer barrel. That is in the mid range of the 454 Casull.  38six nine86 567five Will deliver up to 60 miles. The price is 525 obo."

Have 9-20 round surplus mags and 1 five rounder. Comes with original hand gaurd and has quad rail installed. Comes with original stock (with raised cheek weld), and has retractable stock installed (These are pretty hard to come by). Has small sections of rail installed front and rear for backup sights and comes with Troy industries flip up sights. Also with come with cheap foregrip/bipod and a UTG red dot. I ran a 2.5-10 x 50 scope on it that I would include for the right deal (can send pics if wanted).   Asking $800 OBO.
