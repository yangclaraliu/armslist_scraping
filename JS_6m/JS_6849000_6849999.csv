I think I probably put 1000 rounds through it shooting Skeet and a little Trap. I only used Low Brass #8 Shot when Shooting Skeet with It and it functioned flawlessly for me. I kept it cleaned and lubed. The the only reason I am letting it go is, I upgraded my sporting gun to another brand and model. It still looks and functions great. I would say that is still looks almost new.Features,* Wood and Satin Blued Configuration* Solid Walnut stock and fore-end with Satin finish and Fleur-di-Lis checkering* 28"" Vent Rib Barrel* Dual bead sights* Nickel plated bolt and gold trigger* Skeet and Modified Choke and basic Choke Wrench Included"

I'm looking for something smaller. Car, truck or midsize SUV. Small or full size pickup doesn't matter and I don't care if it's automatic or manual. Don't care about Cab size either. Must be a reliable daily driver. My Tahoe has been well taken care of mechanically. There are no dash lights on at all. I am providing full disclosure on all things good and bad with this truck.The Good:-expensive custom fit seat covers-All four newer all terrain tires(less than a year old)-new rear main seal-new water pump-new brake pads and rotors(installed around Christmas time)-new battery-new alternator-I am including enough white Bedliner to paint the entire truck if you chose to do so. Also comes with the paper to cover the windows and a brand new paint gun. Or you can sell all of that for $300 and use that money for something else.The Bad:-needs refrigerant filled for the AC to work. Has a slow leak and I don't care enough about AC to have it fixed.-either the idler arm or Pittman arm is worn. It makes a popping noise every once in a while when turning sharply out of a parking spot. Does not effect driving or steering.-paint is peeling on the sides. I paid a friend with a body shop to paint it, he painted the roof and hood, but due to family circumstances, the rest of the paint job has been delayed.-small dent in the rear quarter panel by the bumper-small rust spot on one of the doors near the bottom( bottom of the truck is NOT rusted)-the front seats are worn(reason for the nice seat covers)The truck runs great and has 240,000 miles on it. I have put a lot of money into this SUV. Nothing wrong with the engine or transmission. Shifts very smoothly. The engine is very strong, I have towed some pretty heavy stuff with it. If you have a pick-up, car, or midsize SUV, and are looking to trade for something bigger just shoot me an offer. Worst thing I can say is no. Yours can be a little older but not too old and I'm fine with some cosmetic problems since mine has some too. Contact me at REDACTED for more info or if you'd like to come take a look at it and give it a test drive. I am also willing to include Cash and/or things to take to the range for the right trade deal. Clean title in hand."

I bought this a few months back CPO with the intention of making it a carry gun but decided to go another direction. I had a certified gunsmith inspect the firearm after I bought it and he said its in perfect condition with maybe 100 -200 rounds. I like this firearms though it takes some getting use to. Its biggest knock is the trigger because its a long heavy pull because it is double action only. As long as you know how to shoot it shoots great. You have to shoot like a revolver and stage the triger by pulling it about 3/4 then pulling the final 1/4 pull for a very nice clean break. Now if you dont know how to shoot then this gun is not for you.I ask anyone who wants to buy this I want to see a valid Indiana ID and a carry permit.

Our goal is to put serious confidence in your hand for any situation where your safety—or your family’s safety—could be compromised. Your best choice would likely be proportionate to your threat, therefore we make self defense in numerous calibers and many sizes. We hope you never need it, but if you do, a GLOCK is very discouraging to the bad guys. The new GLOCK 42, in .380 AUTO, is a slimline subcompact pistol engineered with the GLOCK Perfection promise and able to withstand the rigors of routine training. Made in the USA, the G42 is the smallest pistol GLOCK has ever introduced, making it ideal for pocket carry and shooters with smaller hands. Years of requests across market groups for a super-concealable, reliable single-stack .380 GLOCK pistol prompted extensive research and development to bring the GLOCK customer the G42."
