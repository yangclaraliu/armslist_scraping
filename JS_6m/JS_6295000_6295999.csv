I have fired it with winchester low recoil low noise target loads. I really don't want to sell it but bills need to be payed...It functions fine. The magazine has a stop in it for hunting laws but it can be removed to add more shells. Although, it seems to be known on the internet as the ""widowmaker"" because of the way the gun was designed. I have never heard of anyone being killed by one but I need to say not to shoot it. The gun was made in 1898. The serial numbers on the barrel and reciever do not match as was standard for marlin at the time. Low 4 digit serials. It does not have the patented hang fire saftey release button that was added on to the gun in 1899. That makes this gun rare. The ATF says this is not a firearm! As such, it can be shipped to most states without an FFL!"

When I originally traded for this rifle earlier last year I was intending to take it hunting, but after alot of thought I just feel that the gun is too beautiful to take out in the woods lol. Plus after having started hunting for the first time last year I realized that I would prefer to have a caliber that could reach out beyond 200 yards with better precision and accuracy than the .44 mag. I have not shot this rifle since I traded for it, but I did disassemble the entire thing and give it a very thorough cleaning. The walnut stocks are still in beautiful condition too! I know these rifles go for $800 brand new, but I would be willing to let mine go for $600. If you're willing to consider a trade towards this gun then I would be interested in rifles only that are chambered in .270, 30-30, 30-06, 308, or something along those lines that will be a good hunting caliber for big game for between 200 and 300 yards. Let me know what you have! The worst I could say is no.I can also send some other pics of the rifle if you are interested. Feel free to send me a message through armslist and then I'll do my best to get back with you as soon as possible."

Both of them are in similar condition. Kept in those crappy old vinyl outside, soft lined cases, for years and not taken out much to be oiled. So they both have a few small spots of rust on the bluing. Most of it will probably clean up fairly well. Other than the finish issues, they look to be in good shape and lock up tight. I would say these are from the 60s / 70s era if I had to guess, but I really don't know.The Stevens is a model 511 series A, 12 guage, with 3"" chambers. It's pretty plain jane, but functional. It has a case colored receiver.From what I can find the ERA is the same manufacturer as a current Stoeger SxS, but I'm not sure if that is true. It is the better looking shotgun. Nice bluing and the wood is nicer with nice checkering. On the bottom is says ""Made in Brazil"", on the barrel is says ""Made in Brazil for F.I.E.

The gun is 90% condition, has a few scratches on the barrel and stock where the gentleman I purchased it from rode it around in his golf cart. I'm not at all interested in selling it, on trading for a nice semi-auto shotgun. This gun has a very low round count, and is pretty hard to find.

Nothing really ""special"" about this line of Smitty's but it is a very reliable, dependable, & affordable handgun. Perfect for someone wanting a bedside/nightstand home defense pistol. Similar to a Glock, there are no external safety mechanisms to worry about finding in the dark or what have you. It's a lock-n-load point-n-shoot pistol with plenty of stopping power yet very manigble recoil. It's a 14+1 capacity. I normally load 12-14 in the magazine, to not over work the spring,  & leave the chamber clear. It is very easy to rack the slide & chamber a round. This was my first gun ever & I still love it to this day. The only reason I'm selling it is because I'm buying a different .40cal that better suits my current needs. Feel free to ask me any questions. It does have an acessory rail under the muzzle on the frame. Also there is a small nick on the rear of the slide where I dropped it. See photo. I added the Hogue grip but will probably remove it to use on the other .40 I'm going to buy unless you want it to stay on for your use, just let me know when you inquire about it. Thanks for looking!Also, just a heads up, I only meet people in public places that are well lit & lots of people around. Something like a Wal-Mart parking lot. There's a bazillion security cameras around & it makes me more comfortable. Sorry for any inconvenience."

(Unless you want me to ship it and you are going to pay the fees in advance). Last, I am probably not interested in trades but I am certainly willing to read any offers you send.  If the offer is resonable and I am not interested I will let you know.  Thanks!"

Featured in a separate SHOT Show auction on GunBroker.com is a Kimber Super Match II 1911 with matching engraving and Serial number “SUPER1911”.The special pair not only marks the first time that Kimber firearms have been featured in the SHOT Show auction, it is also the first time that a themed handgun and rifle have ever been offered by one manufacturer. The rifle and pistol share the “SUPER” serial number theme to emphasize their “Super” status among target shooters, hunters and collectors.This SHOT Show SuperAmerica was hand-engraved by Rob Bunting of Baron Engraving in Trumbull, CT. Rob has engraved several of the most successful guns in the history of the SHOT Show auction. Commenting on the engraving patterns he selected for the SUPERAMERICA, Rob said, “This pattern has a very strong central spine with leaves placed more formally at regular intervals. The spine receives very little shading; the leaves are heavily shaded, and cross-hatched, which creates a very strong contrast in the design. I also removed a fair amount of background from between the scrolls and put a nice strong punch dot pattern down to increase the contrast. Black fill in the cuts makes the whole thing pull together and pop.
The Kimber SUPERAMERICA Traditional rifle offers an extraordinary combination of design and performance features that provide classic bolt-action elegance, reliability, accuracy and light weight. This .308 features a highly polished 22-inch barrel with match-grade chamber and is guaranteed to shoot sub-MOA. Stock is hand-rubbed AAA- grade walnut with ebony forearm tip. Pillar and glass bedding insure accuracy and strength. Five shot capacity with an overall length of 41.25” and weight of only 5 pounds and 10 ounces. This proven long-range rifle is fitted with a Nightforce 2.5 -10 X 42 NXS Compact Riflescope. The NXS is extolled for its streamlined proportions, minimal weight, and performance far beyond its size. The Nightforce NXS Compact has an objective lens assembly that focuses light rays more precisely for exceptional image clarity and color accuracy. The NXS 2.5-10x 42 Compact combines a versatile magnification range with a large exit pupil for fast target acquisition.Nightforce Optics has received major awards from Outdoor Life, Sporting Classics and other experts in the hunting and shooting sports media. Their rugged, reliable repeatability has been the subject of many press reviews and is a key reason demanding hunters, target shooters and tactical professionals have little problem in investing $2,000 or more for scopes like this Nightforce 2.5 -10 X 42 NXS Compact.The SHOT Show Auction is administered for the National Shooting Sports Foundation by the Hunting and Shooting Sports Heritage Trust."
