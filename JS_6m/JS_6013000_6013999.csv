They are finish-chambered and have a DPMS-style barrel extension installed and the gas port hole drilled for a rifle-length gas system. They also are threaded 5/8″ – 24 at the muzzle. These barrels are not compatible with the Armalite or Rock River Arms rifles. All versions of this stainless steel AR-type barrel are chambered with a PTG semi-auto match reamer. They are rifled with an 11″ twist 3-groove configuration in .308 Winchester and an 8″ twist 3-groove in .260 Remington. These barrels are also hand-lapped to our internal finish standards. The section forward of the gas block section is engraved: “Lilja AR .308 Win. 11T”. The barrel extensions are a DPMS type and these barrels will headspace properly with DPMS type bolts. The gas block and gas port hole are positioned for standard rifle length gas tubes.I am going to a shorter barreldue to weight and lack of long range needs. I paid 510 before taxes and shipping for this barrel. it had less than 300 handloads through it. This barrel shoots very well.

Only local meet ups please...near Fort Hood area. Comes with original box and 1 magazine. I will bring a receipt that is a bill of transfer to keep as a receipt for both parties.*****The CW380 pistol has a 2.58 inch barrel, an overall length of 4.96 inches and a height of just 3.9 inches. It weighs just 10.2 ounces without a magazine. The pistol has a black polymer frame and features 4140 steel inserts molded into the front and back of the frame for added rigidity. It has a machined, solid 416 matte stainless steel slide and a textured polymer grip.The Kahr CW380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, and utilizes Kahr's seven patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. The result is a micro-compact pistol with very little recoil and quick follow-up shots. The pistol features drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned-in polymer front sight.Differences between the Kahr CW380 and Kahr P380 models include: the CW series has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel found on P models; the CW slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CW series slide has fewer machining operations, and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; the P380 comes with two magazines, but the CW series comes with one 6 rd steel magazine with flush baseplate. Lastly, the slide locks back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of other value-priced compact semi-auto pistols. The durability and reliability of the CW380 model makes it a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement."

I bought this new in 1988. This is not the Mustang, or Pony version. Single action. It is in ""Good to Excellent” condition. No box, just the 2 mags and a Bianchi #6 that is as old as the gun and you would never know that it’s sitting at the “4 o’clock” position. I carried it for 20 yrs and put it in the safe because I wanted to “safe it”. From what….Don’t know?! I have hand polished this gun and it looks much nicer than the pictures show. I have pretty much shot only Hydrashoks and FMJ through it and have not had any issues. I just got it back from a “checkup” with the gun shop and had the rear sight re-staked. Slightly loose. He confirmed what I already knew. No functioning issues. All is well. I have extra recoil springs, mag springs, and extractor. All parts were bought with the intention of this staying around and in the family for a couple of generations. They stopped making these in ’97 and the new ones they recently came out with just aren’t the same, IMO. Specs and info can be found on the website Genitron.
From my research for sales on these,(they don’t come up much), the price is $675.00

Annual license holders must purchase an elk tag for $51, nonresidents must purchase an elk tag for $306.The hunt dates in our Special Southwest Zone are from Jan 01 - Jan 31 2017 and the elk can be taken with your choice of either a bow or rifle. According to the Oklahoma wildlife regulations, an antlerless elk is defined as any elk with no visable antlers, regardless of sex.The elk found on our ranch are free ranging descendants of those released in the Wichita Wildlife Refuge in the early 1900's by proclamation of Teddy Roosevelt.These are the same elk that hunters wait a lifetime to draw a tag for in the refuge which is only 11 miles as the crow flies from our ranch.There's no need to drive all the way to New Mexico or Colorado as we are nestled in the Wichita Mountains in Kiowa county Oklahoma which is only 200 miles from Fort Worth, an easy 3.5 - 4 hour drive and only 2 hours from Oklahoma City.There are several bulls, cows and calves making regular visits.I have a well concealed 2 person ladder stand and an established ground blind set up for a 30-50 yard shot, or you can pick a spot of your own choosing.This is a fair chase hunt for free ranging animals - not a high fenced canned hunt. Therefore you must rely on your cunning and abilities to bag one of these amazing animals. This is real hunting and as such there is no guarantee that you will fill your tag, that part is up to you.All game regulations will be adhered to and a contract must be signed and notarized.The accompanying photo for this ad is an actual photo taken with one of my trailcams. Contact me for available dates.580 9 one 9 seven 3 six 3"

It is so new in fact, that the action has trouble loading a second round sometimes because it has not been broken in at all. I chose to load it a single round at a time to preserve this factory freshness. I have fired approx 200 rounds through it, and at a veterans fun shoot i brought it to several shooters were consistantly hitting man size targets at 800 yards.

Here you have a collectors rifle, a REAL Sino/Soviet SKS! For those that do not know, after World War Two, Russia sold off a lot of its SKS manufacturing equipment and parts to China and had advisors train them in production, which went on for a short amount of time before relations soured between the two giants and the Russian parts had all been used up. These rifles can be identified by Cyrillic letters prefixing the serial number, side mounted sling swivels, and the Jianshe Arsenal ""26"" manufacturing stamp. I will provide much more detailed photographs if you email me and prove this is not a type 56 faker, but the real deal, a rare soviet ""letter gun"".  The stock has some intriguing trench art, including words and symbols I cannot understand next to several ""tick"" marks. The barrel is in beautiful shape and quite accurate. I will throw in 80 rounds of 7.62x39 hollow point rounds to get you shooting soon. Don't pass up on this rifle SKS enthusiest, the surplus guns have dried up, and are doubling in value, so these sino soviets will soon be all but gone. Open for trades or realistic offers."
