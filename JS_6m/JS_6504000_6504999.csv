It comes with the original box and 3 mags. This is an old first series model 92 that had the later straight slide in stead of the even earlier step side. Production on these stopped in 1983 and the mag release was moved closer to the trigger guard and the safety moved from the frame to the slide. It is very much not a 92fs, though the 92fs had great improvements this is more of a collectors gun. Gun shoots fairly accurate and is reliable as all those Berettas are. This is from wikepedia ""Production began in May 1976, and ended in February 1983. Approximately 7,000 units were of the first ""step slide"" design and the rest were of the second ""straight slide"" type. The total production of both designs was 52,000 pistols."" Sorry no trades, if you live in Carson City or Reno let me know, I make it around northern Nevada a lot. Must be 21 and have Nevada drivers license. Gun is in 9mm parabellum (luger) obviously.

973,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6504973,For Sale:  Mathews No-Cam (LH),"Woodbridge, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 995,"Listed On: Saturday, March 4, 2017",Archery,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Here are the specifics: -LEFT Handed -Currently the bow is set up with a 28.5 inch 85% let=off Rock Mods.  -The bow is set up with 60 to 70 pound limbs in factory Tactical finish. The limbs will top out at about 70+ pounds and can be set as low as 58 safely. Currently set at 70 pounds. -The riser of the bow is in Mathews Tactical finish.  -The string and cable are in great shape as they have been shot very little. I would give them an easy 9 out of 10. As you can see, they are in great condition. -Peep sight is installed, aligned and served into place. -String loop is installed and ready to shoot. -Custom Mathews Dampeners are installed on the two large riser spots as well as the small spot in the sight. -The sight is an Axion Gridlock 5 pin in matching Tactical finish. Just a fantastic sight. There are so many fantastic features to this sight that it would be tough to list them all here. Those of you who know and shoot Axion products know of their amazing quality and durability. 5 pins in .020 size. There is also an adjustable Axion rheostat blue light added to the sight. The light mounts in the bracket of the sight, so that it shines only on the extended fibers of the pins. This eliminates any halo that can occur when lights are shined on the pins themselves and helps to eliminate any external light so that you do not spook any game when hunting. Adjustable brightness on the light by simply turning it brighter or dimmer. 2 inch housing with Glo Ring. It also has a Mathews Harmonic Dampener in the sight to help eliminate any vibration and to match the look of the bow perfectly.  -The stabilizer is a Brand New Axion 6 inch in black finish As those of you who know the Axion products know, this is a fantastic stabilizer in both look and function. There are three Mathews Harmonic Stabilizers and one Mathews Harmonic Dampener in it. Again, matches everything about the bow perfectly.  -The rest is a Trophy Ridge Pro model drop away in matching Tactical finish. This is a great rest that gives you the best of both a containment rest and the drop away. The launcher on the rest can be locked into the up position preshot to contain the arrow for you. That launcher will not drop away until the bow is drawn and shot. With the this rest, you can draw the bow and let back down without the rest dropping away. Very few rests have this function as most other models reset when the bow is drawn. This rest will not drop away until the bow has been shot. The Pro models also have a lock down feature that will lock the launcher into place after the shot to avoid any vibration or noise. The rest is all set up and ready to shoot.  -Brand New braided wrist sling in black is also included.   -Mathews No Cam soft case.   - 1 dozen Easton Storm carbon arrows. Cut to 29.5"".   This setup is flawless and the only reason I am selling is to get a Halon. This bow shoots smooth and I do hate to sell it...but, I only need one bow, so I will pass along a good deal to another bow hunter. All this would be at least $1500-$1700 in a pro shop. $900 is a steal for all this bow comes with. Pretty firm on price. Serious inquiries can get more pictures through text, but you won't be disappointed. Oh, comes with all the packaging for accessories (as seen in picture) and a box for bow included.  Contact Steve @ REDACTED. Please be local to Woodbridge. Please only serious inquiries. I am not selling this because I have to...if need be, I will keep and use it this coming hunting season."
