Still functions flawlessly. It was poorly camouflage painted long before I purchased it and I never bothered to remove it. Comes with 3 barrels. All of them are 2-3/4"" and 3"" chambered. All are Mossberg barrels too. 1st is a 18"" slugger barrel with an extended turkey choke. 2nd is 30"" fill choke barrel.

Never Carried, always in safe. Comes with 4 Magazines (2 HIgh Capacities, 2 standard). HK Factory Night Sights. Also includes the Stream light TRL-3 light that mounts exactly for the pistol. Factory Pistol Case and all accessories This is the model you can drop in the HK .357 sig barrel to shoot an entirely different round with the same magazines. Sorry No trades at this time.USP COMPACT The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability. Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads. To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds. Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol. Features & System Characteristics: Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame Grooved target triggers Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes Specially designed captive recoil spring assembly with polymer absorber bushing Choice of corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish or stainless steel slide One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel No snag, bobbed hammer Flared recurve trigger guard Choice of flat and extended floorplate magazines Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories Ambidextrous magazine release lever Contoured, extended slide release Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator Patented Lock-Out Safety device Overall length: 6.81 in. Overall height: 5.00 in. Overall width: 1.14 in. Barrel length: 3.58 in. Sight radius: 5.35 in."

Essentially all that remains is the barrel. All work was done by Jim Ruiz of Predator Custom shop in Knoxville before they closed their doors in 2015. Jim is a well known smith and the rifle is a hammer. I have the original work order from the shop on all work done. Shoots sub moa groups and that is with a stock barrel and factory ammo. If you handload you can really make it sing. I'm looking to sell as a package with the scope, but I would split the scope and rifle for the right buyer. I am a professional. Please do not lowball me. No trades at this time. Happy to drive to meet up, please show TN ID or HCP. The specs:Remington 700 Action, blue printed and trued. Rechambered to M118 (mil sniper round)20"" barrel. Threaded 5/8x24. Thunderbeast brake/suppressor adapter included. Mcmillan A5 Adjustable stock, GAP camo. Skim bedded with marine Tex by predator. Done the correct way by one of the only qualified smiths in East TN. Badger Ordnance M5 Bottom Metal mag system, accepts AI mags. Come with one 5 round AI mag. Cerakote action and barrel flat black. Badger 20moa rail, Badger Medium 30mm rings. Scope is Leupold Mark 4 ER/T 6.5-20x50. TMR reticle. M5 Turrets. Mil reticle, .1 mil adjustments. This is a rock solid scope with mil/mil adjustments. Also included is Pelican 1750 hard case, w foam cut out specifically for this rifle. **bipod in pic is not included**I am am only selling because I have several other rifles and I am looking to buy a 300 WM setup. Again, no trades. Prefer to keep the package together but will separate scope and rifle for right buyer. Serious inquires only please. Very responsive to email and happy to answer questions. I can send additional pics to serious lookers. Questions on price, please email. I think you will find that by adding up components and shop work, this is a very fair deal. Thanks for looking!"

Finish is so good I suspect a refinish. I disassembled, cleaned, and test fired. Had a couple instances where it didn't re-cock, and worked on the recoil spring assembly which I believe fixed that (have not fired it since, it's been too cold). Pictures tell the story.

I also invested $230 in Carlson's chokes (Waterfoul and Turkey).  This gun has been patterened with reloads but shoots the factory stuff good. But my Turkey load for this gun killed TWO birds at 40 yards last year with the .665"" choke (clean head shots- Dead drops ;) and I can share that recipe with anyone who reloads too.The gun comes WITH a basic (but solid) case, and the FIVE (5) OEM flush fit chokes (and their case and key) for the $475 OBO.  I'd sell the additional Carlsons chokes:  Seven in all for another $150 (but ONLY with the gun for this price please).  More HIGH res pictures are available on request for serious inquiries.  Thanks."

In fact, the 2A/2A1 rifles are not conversions of .303 calibre SMLE Mk III rifles: they were designed and built right from the outset to fire 7.62mm NATO ammunition. Although the 7.62mm NATO and commercial .308 Winchester ammunition are physically interchangeable, these weapons were not designed for use with higher pressure commercial .308 Winchester ammunition.For more info or to order online click>>> used-ishapore-2a1-7-62x51"

Pmag.  This is a new unfired rifle that I never got around to doing anything with because of other projects.  I chose this particular AR-10 because I wanted a bit more range than a 16"" barrel would give and the medium contour barrel keeps the rifle as light as possible without compromising accuracy.  After looking over lots of ballistic data I saw no reason to go with a 20"" barrel, IMO the gain in velocity was simply not worth the extra length and weight.  Again, the rifle is new but it was purchased around three years ago, the only one I could find currently listed was one on Gunbroker for $1,650 in the same configuration.  I do have aftermarket pistol grips and stocks I can add for a little extra, just let me know.
$1,300 firm in cash or higher in trade.  This one cost well over $1,500 after tax and it's new.  Price dropped due to needing to take care of a couple bills in the next day or two.
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and shorter in 9mm and .45 ACP and cash or??  Might also look at a Glock 19, maybe 17 with factory Glock 15rd. to 30+ round mags, prefer a Gen 4 with bright night sights, but will look at Gen 3's too.  Not looking for one that has been ""customized"", except maybe a trigger improvement.  If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.
Must be able to own a firearm in TX.  I can ship insured to another TX resident for $30 more.
Thanks for looking!"

$550 firm in cash or best trade offer will be considered.
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and shorter 9mm and .45ACP.  I'll even consider PSA(or similar brands) pistol uppers and $300+/- cash, since I can buy those new complete from PSA for around $300 shipped.  Might also look at a Glock 19, maybe 17 with factory Glock 15rd. to 30+ round mags, prefer a Gen 4 with bright night sights, but will look at Gen 3's too.  If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.
No scammers and must be able to own a firearm in TX.  Can ship the upper anywhere for $20 more."

Just letting you know in advance that I will require authentication that you actually own the rifle so here is how the deal will go down.
I will require photos of the firearm with a clear photo of the model and serial number. I will ask that you put a phrase on a post it note and put it just under the serial number to prove the gun is in your possession.
Once we agree on a price I will get a cashier’s check drawn on Chase bank made out to you for the full amount and provide you with a photo of it proving I purchased the check. I will block out the routing details on the bottom of the check since you can cash them via image these days.
We will trade FFL names, address and phone numbers.   I will take the check to my FFL and they will ship the check to your FFL. Your FFL will hand you the check when you hand them the full rifle kit. Your FFL will then ship the rifle to my FFL so I can pick it up.
