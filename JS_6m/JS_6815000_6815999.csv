In 1985, he built a muzzleloader with the nipple at the rear of the barrel, directly behind the powder charge instead of alongside. This made ignition far more reliable and began the Great Blackpowder Revolution, which has resulted in muzzleloaders that are practically as accurate, reliable, and fast to load as cartridge-firing arms. All this drives traditionalists mad. But ordinary hunters love it.” Field & Stream"

Small Frame Pocket Model .32M&H Caliber Double Action Revolver.  This unique revolver has a rotating barrel which allows you to rotate the barrel 90 degrees, in order to pull the barrel and cylinder forward to remove the fired cartridge. In addition to the unique case extraction system, you can press an additional lever control when the frame is open that allows the owner to completely remove the barrel. This allows you to swap barrels, helps with cleaning, and makes a shorter conceal carry! The combination of extraction and barrel removal required very precise manufacturing tolerances, and these were considered to be the strongest and most well made revolvers of their time! Features also include a 3"" barrel with very good bore, 5 round capacity, mechanical loading gate, case colored trigger and hammer with nickel folding hammer spur to prevent snagging, checkered hard rubber grips, and retains all of its original factory nickel finish with only small handling marks!

I also have several listed as I am thinning out my collection some. Look at my listings. ThanksI will trade towards multiple cheaper guns, gun plus cash from you, gun plus cash from me, gun for gun, or whatever seems fair to the both of us.I am only trading for pistols, no long guns at all. I am specifically looking for the following.1) Gold coins at 95 % spot price2) Colt Snake guns Python , Anaconda , Cobra , King Cobra , BOA , Diamondback , Viper3) Colt guns ( I do like older ones)4) Nice revolver guns5) Nice 1911 guns 6) kimber k6 3577) Performance Center Guns8) Pre-lock Smith and Wesson revolvers9) Will accept ammo if still in the original box and at a really good deal. I can order ammo by the cases and get good deals so this is basically to even out trades or for bulk ammo at a good discount in case you have some calibers you don't need anymore. (mostly pistol ammo but will accept others possibly)Face to face transaction, I must see your concealed carry permit or get your pistol purchase permit. I will provide the same. If you do need to use a credit card, I do have an app that we can use but it costs 3% extra, and if anything goes through ffl, it is at your expense. I'm willing to help anyway I can on my end.

I have a couple I would be interested in trading. I have another post looking for an M1A and am still out for work. I will get more pictures when I finally make it home. The two rifles I would consider are the two bottom ones in the picture. The bottom one is the PSA. It has a Knight Arms quad rail with covers, Primary Arms Micro Dot with 1/3 co witness riser, Matech flip up rear sight, grip pod, and a 3 point sling (in safe). The middle one is an Anderson chambered in .300 Blackout. It has a free float rail and a 2X7 scope that I believe has the illuminating reticles if I am remembering correctly.
