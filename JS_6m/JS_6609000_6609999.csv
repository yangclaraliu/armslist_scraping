You can find these online from various different websites for anywhere from $250-$450 not including shipping costs. I am making these here locally in the Tri-Cities in my spare time just as a hobby. The approximate measurements are 40 inches long, 26 inches high and 4 inches deep. This version of the flag will have 3 separate compartments. The lower half of the flag will open up to store shotguns or long guns. The top left and top right compartments will open up to store several handguns, magazines, holsters, ammo or whatever else you may want to put in it. I will include 4 gun magnets with screws that you can mount in any of the compartments in any configuration you want. The doors of the compartments are secured with magnetic child safety locks with magnet key. Just pass the magnet key over the outside of the door where the lock is located and it unlocks the door. There are no visible locks for anyone to see. The door hinges are European type cabinet hinges where nothing shows on the outside of the cabinet. So basically when you look at this, it just looks like a decorative flag that's hanging on your wall. I have several different paint schemes I can do. I have that standard red, white and blue flag, the thin blue line, thin red line, thin green line. I also have some subdued military OD green and black flags. I can do them ""distressed"" to make it look old or leave it new. I have additional pics that I can text if you're interested. I am currently working on some different designs and sizes so if you don't see something you like, just ask and I can probably make it.
 
I am asking $200 each for this size flag regardless of colors. I will take either cash or PayPal. I will NOT ship these. The shipping charges are ridiculous. I am willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet but not too far. I will also entertain trades for firearms and ammo. Just let me know what you have and we'll talk. I currently have a few of each pre made but when those run out, I'll need a couple weeks to fulfill your order. Like I said, I have a full time job already. I'm just doing this in my spare time. If you have any questions please TEXT at REDACTED or email through Armslist. Thanks and God Bless!!"

This gun is available for the Gear up and Go promotion with 4 free magazines!!!          Our Range Officer® Champion™ is a perfect fit for those looking for a concealable 1911 that won’t weigh them down. While a normal, all steel 1911 can weigh over two and a half pounds empty, the 9mm Champion™ tips the scales at just 31.5 ounces. The .45ACP model weighs in even less at just 30 ounces, thanks to the bigger hole in the barrel. That’s quite a difference when it’s on the hip all day. While the overall height is the same as that of the Range Officer® Operator®, the Champion™ includes a four inch stainless steel match grade barrel as opposed to the Government size five inch barrel. In the Champion™, we use a bull barrel fitted to the slide that houses a supported ramp to save wear and tear on the frame over time. As a result, we can use lighter weight forged aluminum for the frame. That helps us shave weight for its intended carry mission.The sights are all business, with a fiber optic up front and a low profile combat sight in the rear that won’t snag during the draw. For recoil control and function, we use a dual-spring assembly that allows us to control precisely the recoil impulse in this smaller package, thereby ensuring reliable function with a minimum of fuss to the shooter. The Range Officer® Champion™ is available in 9mm and .45ACP. Both models ship with two magazines, seven rounds each for the .45ACP and nine rounds for the 9MM. Even though the Range Officer® Champion™ is smaller and lighter, you won’t have to sacrifice capacity for carry convenience.

(SER. NOS. 1-357,000) The author wishes to express thanks to Charles Layson for making the following information available and reformatting the Colt 1st Generation SAA section. The Colt SAA was produced in 36 calibers with many special order features or combinations available directly from the Colt factory. These factory special order features can greatly enhance the value of the revolver. The Single Action Colt, or ""Peacemaker,"" as it is often called, is undoubtedly the most collectible handgun in the world, and as such, can command very high prices. Values shown are for guns without special order features. Factory engraving, ivory grips, very rare special order barrel lengths, and special finishes Remember, this is a 1st generation Colt Bisley. Based on the serial number of 214265 it is estimated that this gun was manufactured in 1899. The gun is chambered in 41 Colt. The finish has worn to a fine patina but the function is excellent. The wear on the checkered grips is worn giving the gun the true authenticity of age. This is a fine collectible gun and not for the faint of heart. You may own Colts but if you own this specimen you have finally become the proud owner of a real COLT. Payments:USPS Money Order, Certified Check"

Only reason I'm selling is because It was an impulse buy and although I love it, it is more of a home defense weapon due to it's size. The 1911 grip angle is awesome, everything about this gun is awesome. I really would rather sell than trade but would be willing to consider a trade to something a little more compact.
