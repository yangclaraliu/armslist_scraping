If not a lefty, you can have it anyway if you want.Here's the disclaimer and why I'm going to lose a bit on this gun while someone will get a good deal: I tried to show in pics as best I could, but I dropped this in my hilly driveway and it slid a few feet so the slide on one side and a bit of the frame on the same side has several scuff marks on it. It's cosmetic, not affecting function, but it happened and am listing this in full disclosure.I can provide more pics if requested. Only trade I might be interested in would be a Glock 43 (maybe Glock 26 Gen 4) + cash. Buyer must provide copy of valid AL pistol permit and drivers license at time of sale."

One runs perfectly, the other could use some trimming and modding maybe and it might work. In all the years he's owned this pistol, dad swears up and down it's never had a malfunction besides with one of the Promags, I can atest that I've never seen one. He estimates it's got 2000 rounds through it. It's a great pistol and I was shocked when he said he wanted to sell, only reason he's selling is to recoup some money from a recent 1911 purchase. With all the magazines, case, and general shape of the gun, $350 is a more than fair price for what you get. (Pictured with a magazine in it) so yes, 6 magazines total.) do not need help selling. Will NOT make exceptions and sell to anyone not legal to own firearms."

Chinese SKS-M, takes Ak mags, for trade. Comes with original wood thumbhole stock and Tapco tacticool stock, may or may not come with vfg as pictured... depends on how badly party wants it. Not your everyday SKS. In beautiful shape, only minor issue being a couple of dings in the original stock (not uncommon for its age) and the rear dust cover pin being a tad loose, unlike it's other SKS brothers' pins being too tight to manipulate without a tool. Note! Tolerances for mags with this gun are uncharacteristically tight, metal mags work best. Tapco mags will fit, but too tightly for me to want to try them out. Unsure of fitment of other polymer mags. In NO rush whatsoever to unload, just wanted to see if interesting offers come along. But I'm not going to be a dick about price necessarily like I've seen on some similar models on AL... Figure trade value of roughly 700ish what with that Tapco stock and depending on number of magazines party wants with the rifle... I have many. Does also include original Chinese-marked 10 round mag as well. Not afraid to travel a reasonable distance for the right deal.Thanks for your time, fellow ArmsLister!"

In development for more than four years, the VP9 is H&K's first striker-fired handgun since the P7 series was introduced in the 1980s. Its premium light-pull trigger has a short takeup with a solid, single-action-type break followed by a short, positive reset. Customize grip configurations by changing the three included backstraps and six included sideplates to accommodate various hand sizes. All controls, including the magazine and slide releases, are ambidextrous. Patented charging supports at the rear of the slide enhance leverage and grip for racking the slide, speeding up reloading and making it easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. Extended Picatinny rail molded into the polymer frame supports up to 5.6-oz. accessories. Proprietary captive flat recoil spring improves shooter control.
