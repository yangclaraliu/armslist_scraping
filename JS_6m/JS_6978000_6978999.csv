Details  The P220 Legion is an enhanced version of the gun that started it all for modern day SIG. Finished in a proprietary Legion gray coating and featuring custom G-10 grips with a Legion medallion, the P220 Legion is improved in nearly every way. The stainless-steel slide sports SIG SAUER Electro-Optics X-RAY high visibility day/night sights as well as front cocking serrations that provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm or conducting press checks.The P220 in DA/SA includes a reduced and contoured Elite beavertail, which allows for a higher grip and a reduced profile, thus eliminating printing. More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip. An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. The P220 Legion also features low-profile decocking and slide-catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc. P-SAIT trigger. In addition, a solid steel guide rod adds weight where it matters most. The P220 Legion ships with three 8-round magazines.

It started out as a new model Marlin 336Y, youth model, 16.25"" barrel 30-30. I purchased this rifle new and added a custom stock from Boyds Stocks in OD Green. I added a XS Sight Rail mound a 2.5 power scope but never fired it, it has sat in the safe since. I set this up as a short, fast handling hog rifle but have since found a Marlin 336 LTS 30-30 so I need to move this one. I have removed the XS Sight Rail and scope and replaced the factory sights. The only blemishes on the rifle is where the blue Lock-tit made a slight discoloration on the receiver and the front of the XS Sight Rail made a small rub spot on the barrel. The factory youth stock is included in sale as well as factory box and all paperwork. For more information or pictures, CALL, no texts or emails, call REDACTED, if no answer please leave message and I will call back shortly. For in state, FTF sale, must have ID and be willing to sign BOS. Shipping is available to your FFL for out of state purchase.

The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset."

In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset."

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces."

Bought new and replaced factory walnut stock with a stock from JAE. The stocks are made of aluminum alloy with titanium fittings, and this one has the  Titanium finish. These stocks are super-rare, and sell for $1850, you can get info about the stock and pricing at this link: (jallenglobal.com/rife-stocks/jae-100-g3/jae-100-g3-standard-orders/).  Comes with factory walnut stock, a Sadlak scope mount (the alum version, well known as the best M1A mount made), 8 brand-new Check-Mate/C-products 20rd magazines, 1 factory Springfield mag, the only one of which has ever been used, 3 double-mag pouches, and a hard case. I have put approx 150 rounds down the pipe, its super accurate, and you will be able to tell it has been babied as it doesnt even have a scratch on its feed ramp let alone anywhere else.Now I know that these days putting out $2500 in one shot is painful, but the fact is this is an INCREDIBLE deal for anyone looking to build up the ultimate M1A. The only reason we are selling is that we are having to sell our large homestead due to health reasons and will no longer be able to take advantage of this rifles capabilities at our new house. (we have a 350 yard range built here) The fact is, I HATE having to sell this rifle, its my baby, but I know it will simply sit in the safe forever, so I decided to let somebody give it the attention it deserves.You may contact me if you are interested in buying just the stock and its factory accessories/adjustment tools, and we can negotiate a fair price. This would let me drop the price on the rest of the package and make it easier to sell.I also have 1,000 rounds of XM118 Long Range Lake City 175gr HPBT ammo. This is the ammo manufactured for the military by Lake City/Federal for the military units using the M1A for sniper applications. This ammo is super-rare!, and goes for around $1.50 a round or more IF you can even find it for sale. I would be willing to cut a deal on the ammo (at additional price of course) to whomever buys the M1A package. I WILL NOT sell this ammo until the rifle is sold, so please dont bother to ask.Pictured on the rifle is a Leupold Vari-x Lighted Reticle scope and a Bi-Pod THAT WILL NOT BE SOLD WITH THE RIFLE! The scope is already dedicated to upgrade another rifle when this is sold.Prices As Purchased New:M1A: $1500Sadlak Scope Mount: $170Magazines: $275Pouches: $75JAE Stock: $1850Total price invested: $3,870Will sacrifice for $2500 CASH, FIRM. I must see/verify your Florida ID when meeting face 2 face only at a safe location. NO TRADES! We live at the FL/GA border north of Madison FL, and will be willing to drive up to 75 miles to meet for the sale. If ad is still up, its still for sale! Would consider selling VIA an FFL dealer to an out of state buyer if you cover all costs of doing so, but your funds must be covered first."

I owned it for one dove season and, in that time, put no more than 500 rounds through it. The shotgun comes with original box/papers, 3 factory chokes and camo sling. From the manufacturer:The Affinity 3 semi-automatic shotgun is the ideal coming together of Italian craftsmanship and American passion. Even as you first shoulder it, you’ll be surprised by its lean dimensions, functional design and ideal weight and balance. The trim forend helps keep your eye close to the bore axis, meaning quicker and more intuitive pointing. The custom-grade controls—bolt handle, bolt release and magazine port—are oversized for positive use even with gloved hands. The Inertia Driven® system along with the TSA recoil pad makes the Affinity 3 easy on the shoulder in the field or on the clay range. http://www.franchiusa.com/affinity-3-semi-auto-shotgunPrice firm, not interested in trades.
