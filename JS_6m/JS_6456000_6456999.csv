FN is concentrating production on thier AR15 US Military contract they won last year, and most FN SCAR production models are going towards LE / Military contracts.  That's why you see so few of these over the last 6-12 months. LE / Military pricing has also increased for personal / agencies trying to get these from FN. Last years LE Pricing came in at $2585, this year i'm seeing increases of $2999. NUTS i know! 6 month wait for LE / Military persons @ LE pricing.For all you poor civilians out there sorry guys! It is what it is. Price of this gun as configured in pictures is set at a very reasonable cost of $3350. Lets do the Math. BLACK SCAR 17S are actively selling for NIB for $2800+. FDE models are gone in a matter of hours and start at that price, again SORRY. MREX Rail system with MLOK $248.00.

Description for each item below.This upper has had 20 rounds sent down range. After each round I pulled a Hoppes snake with CLP through it. The barrel never got hot. After the tenth round I cleaned and lubricated the barrel. The final 10 rounds were also slowly fired and the barrel had the snake pulled through. PMC bronze 55 grain brass cased bullets were used. This upper is unbelievably accurate. It is surgical. You won't believe how accurate it is. The condition is absolutely perfect, like new condition, not a scratch on it anywhere. I searched around to find the best armorer I could find to assemble this upper. He works for Black Rifle Works out of Raleigh. The head space was checked with a go-no-go gauge. A Troy Industries low-profile gas block and a Brownells stainless steel rifle length gas tube are installed. The upper is a Cerro Forge 7075 T6 premium anodized upper with a dry lube sprayed on the interior. A Brownells upper assembly kit was installed. The free float tube has two picatinny rails mounted at 9 & 3 o'clock. Both the upper and FFT are T-marked with white paint. Not included --- BCG and charging handle.

They are an up and coming manufacturer. Guns & Ammo actually visited their factory and had nothing but great things to say about Core in their review on their AR rifles. It seems Armslist does not allow links in listing so Google: “CORE 15 Hardcore AR Review” to read.Also, Tactical-Life chose this gun I'm selling to be 1 of the 12 of the Best 300 Blackout AR Pistols On the Market. Google: “12 of the Best 300 Blackout AR Pistols On the Market”Still not convinced? Core's warranty is unparalleled in the industry and applies equally to 1st, 2nd . . . 10th owner of their guns. Google: “The CORE Warranty”Not familiar with 300 Blackout? It is the fastest growing caliber on the market. Unless your target is 250+ yards away, it is far superior to the 5.56/.223 in many ways. Think of it as a 7.62 bullet in a 5.56/.223 case with powder that fully burns in a 10 inch barrel unlike a 7.62 or 5.56/.223 which don't burn completely even in a 16 inch barrel. If you want to know more about the 300 Blackout, message me and I'll reply with some links.This gun is brand new and has not been fired since it left the factory. Since the barrel is less than 16"" long and does not have a rifle stock, it is technically classified as a pistol.Specs:Weight: 6 lbs. 7 oz.Caliber: Chambered in 300 AAC BlackoutLower Receiver: CORE15® Mil-Spec Forged 7075-T6 Lower Receiver, Type III Class II Hard-coat anodized finish, beveled Magwell for improved reloading speed, machined chevrons in front of magazine well, bullet pictogram safety markingsUpper Receiver: CORE15™ Mil-Spec Forged 7075-T6 M-4 Upper Receiver, Type III Class II Hard-coat anodized finish, M4 Feed Ramps, (1913 Picatinny rail flat top) w/ dry lube internal finish and laser engraved T-markingsBolt Carrier Group: CORE15® Mil-Spec Carpenter 158 steel bolt, M16 Chrome Lined 8620 Steel Carrier, Mil-Spec Staked Gas Key, Tool Steel Extractor, Shot PeenedBarrel: 10.5” 1:7 Twist 4150 CMV Pistol Length Gas System Black Nitride FinishRail: CORE Keymod 9.5” RailGrip: Ergo Swift GripFlash Hider: Midwest Industries Flash HiderMagazine: 1 Magpul® 30 rd.

Key features include reliable mid-length gas-piston operation, a (3 second) quick-change barrel, extreme-duty breech bolt, vented high performance barrel extension, and dual-feed operation with installed belt-feed module. The entire weapon field strips in seconds with a cartridge as the only tool necessary. ARES-15 MCR Details Caliber: 5.56x45mm NATO Barrel: The MCR & Shrike 5.56 Quick-Change barrels are turned and chambered on precision MAZAK CNC turning centers from high quality 4140 and 4150V barrel blanks. Muzzle threads are cut to ½ x 28 TPI to accept most common muzzle devices and silencer mounts. Each high-strength and vented proprietary barrel extension is then carefully assembled to a barrel and torqued to exact specifications, and each barrel assembly is then individually checked to ensure proper head spacing. Once they are cleaned and inspected, the chambers and bores are hard-chrome lined for durability and corrosion resistance by an outside plating company that specializes in processing military rifle and machine gun barrels. Upon return to our facility, each barrel is subjected to additional quality control measures before being completed with a rich dark manganese phosphate finish prior to installation of the gas block. Gas blocks are secured with twin 2/0 taper pins and barrels are then fitted with a crush washer and A2 flash hider. All MCR and Shrike 5.56 barrels are fully interchangeable. Upper: The MCR and Shrike 5.56 upper receiver bodies are precision machined from 7075-T651 billet and are Type III, Class II hard coat anodized black in accordance with MIL-Spec MIL-A-8625 for maximum durability and corrosion resistance. Bolt: The premium bolts are precision machined from a proprietary aerospace alloy and heat treated to exacting specifications. The proprietary 6-lug design provides more shear strength than traditional AR type bolts, and also features tangential radii at the tips and root of each lug to minimize the stresses that cause premature failures in the “square-cut” legacy design. The MCR/Shrike 5.56 bolt design was developed for sustained fire applications and is considered overbuilt by most rifle standards, providing a level of safety that is absent in most other rifle designs. Barrel Extension: The specially engineered barrel extensions are at the heart of the quick-change barrel design and are precision machined from a proprietary aerospace alloy and heat treated to exacting specifications. The proprietary design provides more shear strength than traditional AR type barrel extensions, and also features radii at the tips and root of each lug to minimize the stresses that cause premature failures in “square-cut” legacy barrel extensions. The MCR/Shrike 5.56 barrel extension was developed for sustained fire applications and features a special “blowout” relief in the event of a catastrophic bore obstruction, providing a level of safety that is absent in most other weapon designs. Bolt Carrier: Each high-performance MCR bolt carrier is precision machined from aerospace materials and heat treated to exact specifications. The increased mass of the MCR carrier and increased dwell section of the bolt cam slot ensure a longer lockup time prior to extracting the cartridge case. This robust component was developed for sustained fire applications and features a shrouded firing pin area to protect the firing pin head from potential transverse loading by the hammer. s-Piston operationSemi-AutomaticQuick change chrom lined 16.25"" barrel1:7 RH twist1/2""-28 barrel threadsMIL-STD 1913 rail handguardPrecision machined 7075-T6 billet upper receiverForged 7075-T6 lower receiverCarbine length, 6-position telescoping stock assemblyFixed front and rear sight assembliesAccepts standard AR15/M16 magazines or M27 disintegrating linked ammunitionShips with one thirty round magazine and one bag of 100 M27 linksCaliber - .223/5.56"

Great looking and shooting gun only has a couple tiny scratches by the rear sight on top, they are small and look like a mag might have bumped it in the box but you hardly notice them, I just wanted to mention it. Im looking to trade becuase overall I'm just not a fan of the way glock changed the stippling and grip on the new Gen 4's.Im open to trades on other nice handguns H&Ks, Sigs,Brownings, Beretta, maybe a kimber, Im really open to a lot of different handguns as long as the value is around equal. Not looking for any rifle except maybe a Ruger Mini 14 or 30, or maybe an AR depeding upon caliber. No shotguns unless its an nice 12ga over under that is in my favor value wise. Shoot me an email with a pic and we can go from there. All Laws Apply. In order to buy or trade you must exchange a copy of your Nc CCW and Lic and sign a bill of sale like wise all give you a copy of my ccw and lic. Im in Rocky Mount/Tarboro and not looking to travel to far, at most 30 miles.
