I'll tell you what I know about it.     It was previously owned by a law enforcement officer.  I received it as part of a trade deal.  The previous owner shot it very little but he carried it in an inside the waistband holster a lot and the slide had developed a little bit of rust.  He decided to do some amateur gunsmithing and try cutting some lightening holes in the slide so he could use a ported barrel.  He refinished the slide with who knows what and it now has an uneven grey appearance.  He also decided to stipple the right side of the grip for better gripping abilityand sanded down the left side of the grip so along with the magazine release button so it did not agitate him by rubbing against his hip when he wore it.  He also had some of the trigger components replaced with powder river precision parts for a smoother lightened trigger pull.That is about all I know.  Like I said, it looks horrible.  But it functions fine.  I've taken it to the range a few times and probably shot a 1,500 to 2,000 rounds through it without any problems whatsoever.  Shoots great.  If you are looking for a cheap but functioning gun or just something you don't care about getting beat up then here you go.  Asking $250 obo"

Many in Mattapan recognize us as the  Hyde Park store owners who sold many blacks loophole guns here in the 1970's & 80's and on. East Chop,Martha's Vineyard. We sold Obama and associates of V.Jarrett many hand guns to fit Chicago's 1968 gun registration from our Want Advertisers 2004 ads.We delivered about a dozen handguns by Cadillac car of course to Rosemont of course  when Obama was in the Ukraine in Aug 2005.Obamas Aides on the Vineyard and Alex Okrent in Chicago provided us with Mayor Daleys 1968 gun reg cards to backdate ownership. We still have fake ID his Senate cronies provided plus papers with their greasy fingerprints .Obama loved having handguns but didnt want anyone to know he has them.He payed well and now he's out so the story cant hurt him.We are to be interviewed about Obamas Handguns...soon.  I dont make judgements.I am a mercenary to make money ."

Ok, now the shitty part. No trades. Im sure your P226 is great, but no, I don't want it. Price is firm. I'm more than willing to travel to meet you half way, but FTF only. EFA10 or FFL. Did I mention no trades?
 
A note on the TLR1- Even if you dont buy my gun, I highly recomend this light. I also have a Surefire x300 and this one performs just as good if not better for almost half the price.
A note on the Tagua holster - I also own holsters from Crossbreed, Safariland, Strong, BHI, etc.. And Ive got to say, the Tagua is probably my favorite. Again, even if you dont buy my gun, I recomend this holster."

Traps are 180 Sporters built by Outers, before Champion bought them and cheapened them up. Each trap hold 180ea 108mm targets.  All parts still available. Easy traps to maintain. Trailer is an 18' 10k gvw Gatormade from Kentucky with a spare. Easily pulled with a half ton truck. Top folds down for travel and storage. Can be set up and shooting in approx 15 minutes. Trailer has never been towed in, sat out in or used in the rain. Hate to sell it but it just sits in the barn now and would love to see someone else... individual or club or organization be getting some use out of it. Have much more invested in this than my asking price. Currently have some extras that can be thrown in. 8-10 cases of targets. Ear and eye protection. Table for shoot registration.

It is in 7.62 by 39mm. I dropped in a  better trigger Tapco. I also put news retaining pins and a safety lever as well as a retaining plate. It is read to go with a smooth trigger pull. It has very little scratches on the furniture and has been taken care of real well. I hate to part with it but money is needed and it is income tax time. Right now there is an effort to ban these such firearms but a loving patriot would be the ideal candidate to buy this weapon . We will meet at a pawn shop where I will pawn the rifle for 1 dollar. I will hand you the pawn ticket to get it under your name. No nonsense will be tolerated from all parties involved. I will respect your privacy and vice versa. This ensures you can legally receive the firearm while ensuring I have not used it for nefarious purposes. Cash will be exchanged for the pawn ticket aka the proxy the of the weapon. I will check the cash to see if it real at the register. It will cost 1000 less the amount to process the firearm. For example. If the papers are somehow 25 dollars to process. I will hand you the money necessary to complete the transfer of owner ship of the title. 1000 minus 25 is 975. That is what I would walk out the door with after everything is said and done. The amount may vary but the same rules apply. If you want to trade make it interesting. I like other guns such as a 10 mm, Ruger pistols, and tactical shotguns. I also like cash better and money talks. In saying so I might budge on price but not to where I'm getting taken for a ride. If you agree to the terms and procedures contact me to meet to transfer the firearm. It will most likely be at action pawn between our relative locations. Thank you for your time.

These also have a card-reader, so that you can check your trail cam by putting the card directly into the laptop.   Also, I am willing to configure these if the buyer would like.  I can replace the existing hard drive with a 128 GB solid-state drive for $50.  The solid state drive will be faster, and drain the battery less.  I can also add anti-virus for $15.  I know a lot of guys are concerned with online privacy, so if you're interested in an operating system that is designed for privacy I'm glad to accommodate those requests as well. 
 
I have most of the people that I do computer support work for transitioned to business-class laptops, and I have been very pleased with how well these work. The off-lease ones are a great value. The user experience is as good or better as a laptop you’d get from Best Buy, they’re more durable, and the price point is really great.

It is chambered for the .38 Special cartridge and is fitted with a 4-inch (100 mm) barrel, though additional barrel options have been offered at various times during its production. Originally known as the ""K-38 Combat Masterpiece"", it was renamed the Model 15 in 1957 when all Smith & Wesson revolvers were given numerical model numbers. It is a shorter barrel version of the Smith & Wesson Model 14 Target Masterpiece and essentially an adjustable-sight version of the seminal Smith & Wesson Model 10 (""Military and Police"") revolver with target shooting features. The main production run of the Model 15 was from 1949 through 1999. It was discontinued for approximately a decade until 2011, when a re-tooled version was re-released under S&W's Classics Revolvers line.REDACTED"

The Innovative KRISS Super V SystemThe KRISS Super V Recoil Mitigation System uses an innovative nonlinear operating system that revectors energy down and away from the shooter’s shoulder to dramatically reduce felt recoil and muzzle climb. This system allows the shooter to recover faster, for quicker and more accurate sequential shots.
Designed To Work With YouAn extremely low bore axis compliments the KRISS Super V Recoil Mitigation System by aligning the barrel with the user’s arm. This allows the user's body to work together with the KRISS Super V System for maximum control.
Caliber InterchangeabilityThe latest generation of KRISS Vectors are capable of changing calibers to user’s preference. Toolless disassembly lets users quickly change between caliber lower receivers in a matter of seconds.
Glock™ Magazine CompatibleThe KRISS Vector is designed to use the reliable and ubiquitous standard Glock™ magazines. Allowing you to share the same equipment and makes it easy to adopt into any system or loadout.
Threaded For AttachmentsThe KRISS Vector SDP comes with a standard threaded muzzle for the option of attaching your favorite muzzle device or suppressor.
Ready To Go With YouA quick detachable sling point located on the back end of the pistol lets you easily attach and detach a sling. This makes it easy to deploy and easy to store when you need it."

Lightly used hence why I'm getting rid of it. The mount is for the 223 scope. The 308 one that came with the scope had a defect so Bass Pro gave me that one (223) when they boresighted it. Had it on an AR10 and worked great held a zero just fine. Not looking for any trades.

One used magazine is included.   CASH only. I'm not looking for any trades. This is the serialized part considered the 'firearm"", so it must be transferred at an FFL. (No exceptions--Don't ask). My preference is to have it transferred at Island Firearms or Iron City Firearms.  If it is still up, I still have it. I will remove the listing as soon as it is purchased. No shipping."
