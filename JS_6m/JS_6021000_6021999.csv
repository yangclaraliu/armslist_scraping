Chambered in 9mm with 2 mags included. Gun has factory installed SRT (short reset trigger), sig night sights, and E2 grips (similar to a stippled texture and ergonomic). Grips are exceptionally stable and secure. Very comfortable in the hand. Couple that with the low recoil characteristics of a 9mm and you have a quick fire tack driver. Gun is railed and has never had an accessory mounted. Completely unblemished finish. Included is a custom molded Kydex holster from 3i holsters. I had it molded from my actual gun for a precise fit. Adjustable retention. Holster is thick, lightweight, and well made. It can be worn IWB or OWB. Both attachments are included. Kydex is black with red rivets. Also included is a single mag carrier. Also can be worn IWB/OWB. Adjustable retention on that as well. Package makes for a excellent EDC gun. I have included stock photos of the gun and mag carrier. The holster photo is actual from 3i's website. Original hard case, cable lock, paperwork is included, as well as 2 mags and 100 rounds of range ammo. Complete carry package. I will send many more pics upon request. I am looking more to trade, rather than sell, but the right cash offer will take it. I'm looking for a 1911. I higher brand or a mid-range brand with accessories included. I really like Sig, so any Sig offer goes to top of the list. I'm fair and open minded to offers. I am willing to travel within reason depending on the deal. I am in central Ohio, so I can travel all directions. Please send offers, worst I can say is no and I always enjoy speaking with like minded gun owners. Thanks for looking and have a nice day. As always, be safe and shoot straight. Note: I am fully prepared to sign a bill of sale as I will expect one signed in returned.
