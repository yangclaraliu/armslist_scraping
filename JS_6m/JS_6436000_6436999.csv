This gun doesn't have a serial number because it was manufactured before 1968 when they weren't required to put the number on firearms (look it up, it's true).

The trigger is ultra light Target AccuTrigger.  Single shot (no openning under receiver, to increase accuracy). The barral is heavy bull barrel, and 30"" long. The twist is 1 in 12"". With the outfit shown in picture, I managed to shoot 3 bullets in one hole at 100 yard. But I don't have a longer shooting range to shoot. So I have to give up this long distance shooting dream and pass this gun to someone who have access to a shooting range of 200, 300, 500 yards and beyond. The one solid piece base plate for scope will go with the gun for extra $90 ($130 new). This solid steel baseplate is made by Nightforce specifically for this gun model with a prefect fit for the contour of this gun's receiver. It has a 20 MOA offset for long range shooting. The Nightforce scope and Nightforce ring has been mounted by a gunsmith. The glass is worth more than the gun. So if you want to buy this glass, it will be a separate talk. If you are a serious into target shooting, we can arange to find a shooting range to try out this current outfit. If we reach a deal on the gun, I will take off the scope and sell you the gun. I bought it new and have shot about 30 rounds. Thanks for looking."

I am selling a like new (Just bought it about a month ago and put only less than 50 rounds through it) Henry 22lr -Small Game Carbine.I have changed my mind after buying it since I literally have TOO many 22lr's and not enough arms to bring it to the range.What is different about this rifle is that it has the octagon barrel, carbine length (16inch barrel), and PEEP sights. The peep sights are awesome and make this rifle a gun worth having!It shoots 22lr, 22 long, and even 22 shorts. and YES this is the model with the large lever loop. Looks awesome and very cowboyish.22 is coming back now because of TRUMP so nows the time to get a BA rifle and plink with family and friends!I bought it brand new at Cabelas for 420ish with tax. Still comes with original everything, tags, manual, and henry box.I am selling it for 300.00 FIRM. NO TRADES. NO LOW BALL. That is literally 100+ dollars off on a like NEW rifle.If it sells within the first week of the actual post from Feb 8th, I'll include a free box of Federal Bulk Ammo. I think it is a 333 round bulk pack valued around 19.99 at cabelas.After a week this rifle will come without the bonus ammo.If you have any questions or need any real pictures please give me a text not a call. I am usually working or taking classes.7 7 0 8 5 6 2 8 1 7 - LeI have the right to sell to whomever I chose.

This side-attaching scope mount for the AK variant rifles was born to meet and exceed the toughest objectives put in front of Arsenal The one-piece CNC precision machined SM-13 is manufactured from aircraft grade aluminum alloy for the minimum weight (only 5.76 ounces) and maximum strength.  The over-7.5-inches-long Picatinny rail that runs along the rifle, from the end of the top cover to the rear sight leaf, allows for attaching multiple devices at the same time or one device for the maximum eye relief. The SM-13 follows the contour of the rifle closely. The absolute low profile and the relief cut along the rail allow the use of the iron sights even when the scope mount is attached to the rifle.  The SM-13 utilizes the time-proven steel adjustable locking mechanism that allows instantaneous attachment and release of the scope mount without any compromise to the accuracy and loss of zero. Unlike some other mounts that attach to unstable top covers or gas tubes, the SM-13 attaches to the side scope rail of an AK variant rifle, which provides the most stable attaching platform on the rifle.Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.Buy this scope mount online at www.copsgunshop.net."
