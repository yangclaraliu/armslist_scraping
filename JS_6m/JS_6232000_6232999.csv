Added a genuine Russian Tula AKS-74U triangle stock. Fired 120 rounds through it and then stripped the gun down and sent it off to Area 15 in Mesa for Tactical Gray Cerakoting. Before reassembly, I swapped in the following new parts: Tapco G2 trigger, Krebs trigger pin retaining plate, new Arsenal Bulgarian trigger pins, top cover hinge pin, spring, catch, rear side-folder 4.5mm hinge pin, etc. and polished the bolt contact points for smoother cycling. Has not been fired since.Comes with original Arsenal sling, oil bottle, cleaning kit, cleaning rod, manual, and box. Also included is a new Arsenal Bulgarian Krinkov flash hider/booster (KR-007B) for when you eventually SBR this, plus two Circle ((10)) 30-round, 5.45x39 black polymer, steel reinforced magazines, and 390 rounds of Golden Bear 5.45x39 FMJ 60 grain non-corrosive ammo in a Plano plastic can.Please note that my trust name has been lasered onto the right side of the receiver, but this is NOT an NFA item. This was done prior to Cerakote, so it is very subtle. There are no legal constraints with having my trust info on the gun, but I understand buyer will likely wish to cover this over in some way. I've adjusted the price to account for this.I am selling everything listed as a complete package for $1,200. Do the math and you'll see what a huge loss I'm taking on this gun. Therefore, I'm not open to negotiating nor am I interested in trades. Cash only.Call/text Scott REDACTED. Not looking to ship at this time. Local buyers only."

In addition, this gun can shoot .32 H&R Magnum, .32 Longs and Shorts. I purchased this firearm a few weeks ago with plans to use it as my CCW, but decided on something else. It is brand new, never shot. It comes with all factory supplied items (box, case, papers, etc) and I have included a Galco IWB black leather holster(Top rated, most popular holster via Reddit & Amazon), and 100rds of .327 Federal Magnum ammo and 25rds of .32 HR Magnum Hornady Critical Defense ammo. Pictures are shamelessly stolen from the internet, as I am at the coffee shop and don't have any.
