Purchased for my wife but she opted for something else.The PT22 is a .22 LR semi-automatic pistol produced by Taurus and features an 8+1 round capacity magazine. The PT22 is a cast aluminum frame and steel slide, manufactured in Florida, USA. It has a spur-less hammer, and a long but smooth double action only (DAO) trigger. The ""tip up"" barrel is useful in that the first round may be chambered directly into the barrel, and the operator does not have to ""pull back"" or ""rack"" the slide. Retracting the slide is difficult due to the heavy spring required in this blow-back action.The grip feel of the PT22 is ""fat"", and fills a normal-sized hand. This width may make the PT22 difficult for some smaller handed people to hold comfortably. The Taurus PT22 is only able to fire standard or high velocity cartridges; CCI Mini-Mags work flawlessly.Will ship to an FFL if out of state for $35.00. Local purchasers must have a CCP or transfer will take place via FFL."
