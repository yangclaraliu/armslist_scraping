Nearly identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter owing to its forged aluminum frame, making it more comfortable for everyday carry. Very similar to the P-01, the PCR uses the same alloy frame minus the light rail, making it even more concealable. Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger pull is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicatorProduct Name  CZ 75 PCR – 9mm   SKU 01194   Firearm Type  Handgun   Purpose  Concealed Carry  Chambering  9mm Luger   Magazine Capacity  10  Magazine Type  Double Stack   Frame  Aluminum (7075 T6)   Grips  Rubber   Trigger Mech  DA/SA   Sights  Snag-Free Fixed 3-Dot   Barrel  Cold Hammer Forged   Barrel Length  3.75 in   Weight  27.5 oz   Overall Length  7.24 in   Height  5.03 in   Width  1.38 in   Safety  Decocking Lever, Safety Stop on Hammer, Firing Pin Block Safety, Loaded Chamber IndicatorWe accept visa/mastercard/discover at a 3% loss of cash.

In fact there are 6 configurations for all of the models. (9mm, 357 Sig, and 45 S&W)All in all this is a very well built gun that bears the Sig Saur name.The following text is from the official sig siteThe SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

Bought it brand new in November, but I have to part with it as I am moving. Only two magazines of ammo have gone through this firearm. Only got to carry it once.

The price is firm and I expect a few things if you want to purchase from me:-Valid Virginia driver's license-Valid concealed carry permit for Virginia with an address matching the driver's license-Willing to meet in a public place for the purchase-Willing to sign a bill of saleBelow is the description of the gun from CZ-USA. Everything in the description is available with this gun. If you have any other questions, please feel free to write me. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
Introduced in 2009, the CZ P-07 was the first handgun to feature the convertible Omega trigger system. A simplification of the CZ 75’s hammer ignition method, the Omega’s trigger parts are interlocking in nature, allowing full disassembly and reassembly without the need for gunsmithing experience or tools.
The best part of this system is its convertible decocker/safety system. Whether the user wants to carry the pistol cocked and locked like a 1911 or decocked for a double-action first pull of the trigger, a few minutes time allows the swapping of the safety for a decocking lever or vice versa.
The P-07 received a facelift in 2014, removing any sharp edges and adding forward cocking serrations and interchangeable backstraps. Metal sights, new trigger and hammer designs and a fiber-reinforced polymer rounded out the updates, resulting in a pistol that’s even more comfortable for all-day carry, increasingly adaptable to user preferences and hardier than ever before."""

This gun shoots AWESOME. It's extremely smooth. ONLY reason I'm selling it, is due to an old shoulder injury heavier rifles are harder for me to hold up and fire comfortably.
