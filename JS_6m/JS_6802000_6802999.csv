There are no upgraded parts on this firearm, everything is factory.  Chambered in .357/.38spl. The matte finish is really unique but the most impressive part of this revolver I think, is the beveled edges on the drum & barrel, and the cylinder release. It only needs to be pushed straight in, as most revolvers are not like this, it makes reloads slightly smoother. The Green fiber optic front & adjustable blacked out rear Novak Sights are very easily put on target. Rubber grips with cherry wood inlays. It has less than 100 rounds down the tube, you can get the rest of the box of ammo with the gun if you'd like. (15ish rounds) This gun retailed for $799-$829 when released, any that I can find for sale right now are asking $700-$750 in good condition. I'm looking for $650 or trade towards an STI 1911. It will come with the original paperwork, test fire casings, cylinder protector, disassembly pin and Ruger hard case. Emails tend to get overlooked, please call or text anytime for a faster response.

Includes whats seen in the pics, most notable of which is a blank ""Preferred Owner Program"" card. I never registered it so I guess you can do it if you wanted to, I just left it in the doc case. Watch is SS so it has normal wear marks, not abused at all. Sapphire crystal is in perfect shape no scratches. Recent professionally changed battery in the last 2 months. Can meet at a jewelers in Crestview if you wanted to make sure its legit if ya want. Watch guys know its priced fair. Google the WAF1110 and you'll see the going rates for these. Mine is priced right for the condition and since original box and docs included. Most offerings online do not include those items. $700 firm."

Ruger® Rapid Deploy folding rear sight provides windage adjustability, and pairs with the elevation adjustable front sight for a solid, reliable aiming system. The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed.
Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear.
Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.
Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability.
Front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A2-style F-height allows co-witness with many optics.
Patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts most standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired.
Milled gas block is located at a carbine-length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface.
Medium contour cold hammer-forged barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.
Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control.
Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.
Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting.
Handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability.
