And yes, it’s High Pressure Tested and Magnetic Particle Inspected (HPT/MPI) Nickel Boron has proven itself to be the most durable finish on the market. It’s much smoother than Hard Chrome, it’s easier to clean, makes the rifle cycle smoother, it can be run almost lube free for thousands of rounds, and it will never chip, peal, or flake off! Because of these benefits, Nickel Boron is being adopted by the Military as well as many Government agencies. As you can see, these BCGs are a huge improvement over a standard Phosphate BCG and it’s even an improvement over Hard Chrome. Upgrade to a better BCG today. You won’t be sorry! NOTE: This BCG works in AR-15s. This BCG does NOT make your rifle fully-automatic. Features  Machined from 8620 Tool Steel (Carrier) and 158 Carpenter Steel (Bolt) Shrouded firing pin.

The outcome is a firearm with superior suppression capability and enhanced reliability with both supersonic and subsonic loads A two-position gas block makes the transition from subsonic to supersonic as fast as flipping the lever. Changing between 300BLK and 5.56 NATO is as simple as swapping barrels and magazines in a matter of minutes. Converting to 7.62x39mm simply requires barrel, magazine, as well as an additional bolt change. Each SIG MCX features an aluminum KeyMod handguard, AR-style lower controls and utilizes polymer magazines. A revolutionary recoil system does not require a buffer tube, allowing for side-folding stocks. A picatinny top rail allows for the mounting of lights or optics. The aluminum forend allows for rail sections to be added where they are needed, permitting the attachment of accessories. The lower receiver offers familiar AR-style controls. Completely ambidextrous controls include the safety, magazine release and charging handle."

It is believed to be one of 5,320 pistols made for the Argentinean police and used  for about 70 years before Sarco imported it back to the USA,   where it was born.   During its time in the Policia Federale, this pistol  was undoubtedly used during Argentina's many revolutions and decades of political upheaval as evidenced by heavy use.   If only it could talk!   This particular pistol has had the disconnector and sear replaced by Wood Bros.   The originals that came with it are included. Included with this pistol is the original sear and disconnector,   set of Pachmeyer grips, Navidrex Mahogany grips, and a 50 round box Federal ammo.   As you can see, this pistol has been through a great deal of history but still functions great!   Made in America with the Colt pony still legible!  A special treasure for the serious collector!  Asking $950. Buyer must sign a Bill of Sale and must present a Florida Driver License or State I.D. Cash only.

Built around our newest 18” Strength to Weight, Cold Hammer Forged barrel, this platform delivers the speed, controllability, and precision required to engage the course designer’s most difficult stages. The V11 Pro carries the new SLiM Rail 15.0 which offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. Competitors will also appreciate the larger latch provided by a Vltor Gunfighter Mod 4 Charging Handle for easier manipulation under magnified optics. A newly designed Muzzle Climb Mitigator redirects propellant gasses through calibrated ports, countering both recoil and muzzle climb. A Geissele Automatics Super Dynamic 3 Gun Trigger delivers rapid hits on target with its light, short pull and quick reset. Combined with the softened recoil impulse of a rifle length gas system, equals shorter split times, more precise follow-up shots, and reduced fatigue.

The design is a rifle version of the popular Kel-Tec PMR-30 pistol. The same 30 round magazines are used. The single action trigger mechanism, bolt stop, ambidextrous safety levers, and mag catch are also identical. The CMR-30 rifle includes a collapsible stock and the 16” barrel is threaded 1/2”-28 to accept many different muzzle attachments. The multi-position collapsible stock allows for a short overall length of 22.7” with the stock collapsed, and 30.6” when extended. The long top picatinny rail will accept a multitude of different optics, and the removable under picatinny rail is included. The ambidextrous operating handles are non-reciprocating and latch in the forward position. The stock latch lever is also ambidextrous and located just in front of the trigger guard. An integral sling loop is included near the rear of the grip, on both sides. LAST ONE! Call ASAP to reserve.   The CMR-30 is constructed of hard-coat anodized aluminum for the upper assembly and rails and houses the steel barrel. The collapsible stock is made with aluminum stock rods, and a nylon butt plate. The stock was designed to have a natural cheek weld when extended. The grip, mag catch, safety levers, stock latch, and operating handles are made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel). The grip houses the frame which is made of aluminum. The bolt assembly houses a captive recoil spring assembly. Magpul®  flip-up sights included.   The extensive use of aluminum, and a lock time lower than most bolt action rifles makes the CMR-30 a very accurate rifle.

With the 50+ stains available at any hardware store, the beautiful brasswork, and 10+ finishes for metal parts, this is an opportunity for you to make, truly, a gun that is yours and yours alone.
 
For example, I chose to cerakote my barrel for a nice matte black finish. And rather than the traditional brown, I chose a deep, dark red stain, which compliments the matte black barrel beautifully. this is truly a customizable firearm, and for all my modern firearms, the one that gets the most talk at the range is still my custom Kentucky long rifle.   This is a wonderful project for anyone, and I promise, having built over a dozen, it's not nearly as hard as it seems. All the heavy lifting is done for you, all that remains is customization and final assembly.I am happy to ship anywhere in North America. Shipping is at-cost.I also sell packs of 100 .490 balls, for $18 per package. Please be advised, this will increase your shipping quote by several pounds, lead is not a cheap material. That being said, these are all handcast by me, out of pure lead. I don't sell rounds I would not personally use.Email me anytime."
