I bought this to shoot sporting clays, trap and skeet. It has performed flawlessly! The previous owner spent a considerable amount of money on having the fully adjustable comb and butt plate. It has the ported 30' barrels with extended Muller chokes. I tried six different Muller chokes and several Briley chokes and found the combination of U3 competition and U Passing to be the best for trap shooting. These chokes also worked well with sporting clays. The chokes were purchased new from Muller around May of this year.The case is the authentic Browning case made for this gun (not cheap) and is less than 6 months old. As you can see in the photos (sorry, I am not a great photographer) the locking lever is well to the right of center, which is a positive when judging the wear on O/U guns. This is the, in my opinion, best steel barrel the Brownings came with- the Japanese Miroku 'special steel'. I ran the s/n through Browning before purchasing it and found that it had been complete checked out by Browning along with the latest ejectors available. It fits like a glove and a solid shooter! Will consider selling without the Muller chokes at a reduced price."

The rifle has the USMG fake suppressor barrel ext and fixed triangle stock attached. The stock is held on by the pistol grip so the rear trunion is still undrilled. The rifle can be converted back to a pistol if you want and I do have the krink muzzle break the pistol comes with. I will not separate the stock and barrel extension though, it all comes as one. This takes STANAG mags so the same as any AR but with the reliability of an AK. 5 mags total and the gun has had less than 100 rounds through it. Selling mostly because I don't want to deal with 41f in converting it into an SBR."

Very interesting old revolvers. This one has a roughly 6 inch barrel. Fairly odd for this style revolver. The bluing has worn to a nice grey patina. Some original bluing still left on the trigger guard. Pearl grips APPEAR to be real pearl. Not faux pearl. Given its age, I'd bet it was real pearl. Timing is off slightly as should be expected on a gun or this nature and age. I carefully indexed each cylinder before firing to ensure no damage to the forcing cone of the barrel. Really cool pistol. Serial number dates this one back to probably 1898-99. So, if you want a pretty cool gun that probably has a whole lot of interesting stories to tel(if it could talk. Don't be silly. It's a gun.) then this is it. And it won't break the bank like some of Smith's more popular models like the Schofield. It is top break and a 5 shot. Shoots .38 S&W. NOT .38 Special.
