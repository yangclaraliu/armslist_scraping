Traded for gun from a kid who bought it but never got around to hunting with it. I bought a brand new mag and put 5 high quality Hornady's through it to see if it was good. Shot a great group and is pretty much zeroed in where she sits. I'm willing to trade for almost anything but a muzzle loader or single shot shotgun (double barrel is ok though). I'd be happy to pay up with cash if your trade is worth more to make it even. But I'll happy sell the gun straight out too and put it toward's something at my buddy's shop.Price is trade value, cash is OBO - please nothing that'll be insulting in cash - don't need it.I can meet in Bearice, Crete, or for a little more in Lincoln. I have ammo to trade too, or not if you don't want it. Plenty of 9mm (high and low quality) and a few boxes of nice .223 if you want to hunt coyotes with this gun today. It also came with a powerful red predator light and attachment. I'll throw that in with the charger for a few extra bucks if you like those things. Otherwise I'll keep it on one of my kid's 22's. Email me at 'dustysowards @ yahoo' or call/text at REDACTED. I work nights right now so anytime after 6 PM I'm awake and will take the call. If I don't, please leave a message (I've got a wierd VM message just ignore me and tell me its about the gun). Or text any time. Email is still great for reaching me too.There's not much else to say about the gun except Savage is putting out damn fine bolt action rifles these days and the scope is nice and clear. You can look up the package at Cabale's and of course you can see I'll beat the price or take that extra nice gun off your hands. Thanks a lot for looking - hope to hear from you soon. (Just an FYI it's just an extra gun from a trade, so please no insulting offers I don't need the cash, I'll find a trade someday - I'd just rather it be sooner than later since I use all my .223 ammo in my AR's currently).Quick FYI, The bipod is not going with the gun (I mean everything has a price if thats a problem)."

The Leupold Mark 4 will only be sold to military and law enforcement units starting January 1st, 2017. The Leupold Mark 4 series of scopes has been very successful in the civilian market over the years because of their success and endorsement by the military. With that being said, Leupold's target market for the Mark 4 is the military. It is disheartening that they will now reserve the Mark 4 for only them, but it does make sense.

With the intuitive operation of a 1911-style thumb safety, the Micro Bel Air gets on target quickly, when fractions of a second count. The aluminum frame keeps weight down for comfortable carry and resists corrosion from carrying the pistol close to the body. Low profile sights provide quick sight acquisition and interfere minimally when drawing the weapon from a holster or purse. A match-grade aluminum trigger offers a consistently crisp pull for accurate shot placement. The Kimber Micro Bel Air is an extremely lightweight and compact semi-auto pistol that conceals easily and deploys instantly."
