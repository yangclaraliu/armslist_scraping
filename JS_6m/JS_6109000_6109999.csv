The smallest targets appear highly detailed and and so close that you can touch them. Sensational 92 % light transmission and the unique 60 mm lens provide the necessary brightness to enable accurate long-range shots even at high magnification in darkness. A large exit pupil facilitates fast target acquisition as soon as the weapon is raised. The optical system on the VICTORY V8 impresses with maximum detail rendition thanks to its combination of HT and FL concepts, and also comes standard with parallax compensation. The latest VICTORY V8 from ZEISS therefore unites the properties of the most flexible riflescope on the market with those of a spotting scope. Another highlight is the finest illuminated dot in the world that features subtension the size of a two cent coin at a distance of 1.000 m. In short, it is the most powerful riflescope from ZEISS."

Two accessory rails come standard with the rifle and can be reconfigured easily to adapt the hand guard to your needs and can also be mounted at 45 degree offsets. The ergonomics of this rail set a new standard. The anti-rotational tabs make this handguard all the more impressive by virtually eliminating the possibility of the rail losing alignment even under hard use. And the QD sling mount that is included just makes this package that much more outstanding. The Adams Arms piston system is one piece and is accessible from the front of the piston block. Iron sight optics (not included) are designed to be affixed to the sturdy piston block which is attached to the barrel, as opposed to attaching front sights to our competitor's inherently flexible rails that have to be frequently removed and reattached. The Adams Arms patented piston system will run cleaner, cooler, and longer. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process making them incredibly hard. The Magpul CTR butt stock is designed for light, fast action.

The 5"" barrel provides a longer sight radius for enhanced accuracy, and faster recovery between shots to keep the shooter on target during rapid fire. This is a full-sized semi-automatic pistol meant for law enforcement, home defense, field carry, and tactical deployments. The ergonomic design of Springfield XD pistols optimizes pointability and shooting control. XDs have durable polymer frames and a Melonite-coated forged steel slides. Checkering on the frame provides a solid grip to keep the pistol in place when shooting, and dual slide serrations provide a secure hold when loading or clearing the weapon. A grip safety (similar to a 1911) blocks the weapon from firing unless the safety is depressed, which happens naturally when the pistol is held correctly, but automatically goes ""on safe"" when the shooter's hold is released. An articulated safety lever built into the trigger blade backs up the grip safety. A loaded chamber indicator and striker status indicator give both visual and tactile indication whether the gun is loaded and ready to fire in any lighting condition. 3-dot, steel sights on this semi-automatic pistol provide rapid sight acquisition, and are dovetailed into the slide for easy replacement with after market night sights; and, an integral rail on the frame allows the attachment of aftermarket tactical sights and lights. An ambidextrous magazine release accommodates either hand. The Springfield Armory XD Tactical Semi-Auto Pistol fieldstrips easily without tools for cleaning and maintenance. Comes with 2 high-capacity magazines."

Shipped in 44-40 WCF with a 4 3/4 inch blue barrel, which is the current configuration. The Colt archive letter will become the property of the buyer. Gun is all original and unmolested and has all matching numbers on the frame, trigger guard, and butt. Colt did not number the SAA cylinders and barrels after 1887.

Gun has black rubber grips with rampant pony on top, which have no cracks or disfigurement with checkering at about 75%. Also has composit Ivory grips. The Colt is in very nice shape for being 110 years old. Has lost most of the barrel and cylinder bluing and most of the case hardening color on the frame. Has an extra blued Gen 1 cylinder.

Bestguarder has the strap, it is easy for handhold; Bushnell has the rope ring to prevent it slip from hand. Bestguarder has two tripod jacks at the side and bottom, Bushnell just has one tripod jack.  --Functionality: They have the same hot keys for power, zoon in & out, IR, brightness, and REC, but Bestguarder has the built-in menu, I can program the resolution, date & time, video size, backlight and language, Bushnell doesn’t have these functions.  --Digital Zoom: Bestguarder has the 5X digital zoom from 1.0X to 5.0X, Bushnell just has 3X from 1.0X to 3.0X  --Resolution: Bestguarder has 3 resolution(2952*1944, 1600*1200 and 640*480) for picture and 2 resolution(1280*720, 640*480) for video; Bushnell just has the 640*480 resolution."

This rifle’s bolt design enabled soldiers of the British Empire to put out high volumes of accurate fire. The Enfield’s 10 shot magazine was also double the magazine capacity of the German Gewehr 98 Mauser 8mm rifle.  However the MKIII Enfield had its faults, namely its sights. The MKIII had open sights, which were inferior to peep sights for use in combat.  The No. 4 featured a peep sight that was more rugged than the Mk. V sights. It also had a heavy barrel and a spike bayonet. Further trials of the No. 4 were carried out to work out issues with the rifles, and the rifle was adopted for use by the British Army in 1939. Despite the adoption in 1939, mass production of the No. 4 rifle didn’t begin until 1941. During World War Two the No.4 saw widespread use by British forces.  The weapon was used in all theaters of war in which the British fought. The weapon performed well, and was reliable just like the MKIII Enfield which it replaced.  Canadian production of the Lee Enfield No 4 Rifle began in 1941 at the Long Branch Arsenal in Toronto. Wartime production of the No. 4 ceased in 1945, but the rifle was later put back into production from 1949 until 1950. Long Branch made over 900,000 No. 4 Enfield rifles in total.Clear coat has been put over the woodGreat Condition"

The accuracy of this rifle is simply AMAZING!!Look closely at the ad picture and you will see that the 3 shot group at 100 yards is about the size of a dime! Actually I mic'd the group and came up with .501"" and after subtracting the .284 bullet diameter, the actual group size equals .217"" (Less than a quarter inch!!!) I can't stand a gun that has harsh recoil because it makes me flinch and screws with my accuracy. This small group is testament to the fact that the felt recoil is very manageable. I have seen custom built rifles costing several thousand dollars not shoot any better than this one. After I shot this group, I prompted de-listed the ad thinking that I would add this rifle to my already safe-busting personal collection but practicality got the best of me and I've decided to go ahead and sell this tackdriver.Unlike the more traditional 7mm Rem mag, the 7mm WSM utilizes a non-belted magnum case, basically allowing for tighter tolerances.With the asking price on this rifle I will also include the dies and about 50 rounds of brass as well as the recipe I used to attain this small group.Be sure to check out my other listings.Text 580 nine 1 nine 7 three 6 three"
