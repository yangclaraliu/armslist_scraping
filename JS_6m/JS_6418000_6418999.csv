If you are unfamiliar with the conversion process, the details will be lost on you.The trigger guard/ mag-catch is one piece, not a bend around guard screwed in the receiver.The old pin holes are welded in, not plastic plugs.The whole gun has been media blasted and gun refinished in Norrell's Moly Resin.The brake is a functional hunting brake instead of a large AK-74 style.The other mods are intentional, not short-cutted. I wanted to keep the longer Saiga handguard, and Saiga 300 meter sights instead of switching over to AK style replacements. It makes the gun unique, lighter, and feels more compact.The grip is US Palm.The stock is Magpul.The trigger is a G-2.The extension tube is VLTOR.This is my last AK to sell, and by far the nicest shooting one out of close to a dozen I have already let go.The gun has about 40 rounds fired, and is in pristine condition.There are 24 or 25 mags ranging from 5rd to 40rd. They are all the best of what I had, and are Russian, Bulgarian, Magpul, etc.There is a 550 round sealed tin of Chines steel core that I have seen going as high as 1.00 a round.There is a another 400-500 rounds of unique ammo such as more steel core, copper washed, brass cased, German, and some Wolf.Also included is the original cleaning kit, a nice sight tool, and original owners manual to the rifle.I am asking 1250 for the rifle, 375 for the mags, and 500 for the ammo.I am not willing to separate at this time, as it is the last of my AK collection, and I don't want to be stuck with any of the items independently.If you know your firearms, or do some honest research, you should find that this is a deal."

68,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6418068,For Sale:  Classic and Rare Sig Sauer P230SL,"Homestead, Miami-Dade, South Florida",$ 699,"Listed On: Saturday, February 4, 2017",Handguns,Sig Sauer                                                                                ,380 ACP                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"For sale we have an absolutely gorgeous Sig Sauer P230SL .380 pistol. This one is a trip back in time to the 80's, when this pistol was as small as it got in a reliable carry firearm. In those days the Walther PPK and the Sig Sauer P230SL battled it out for recognition as the ""Mercedes Benz of .380s"". In my opinion, the Sig Sauer won this close contest, because it had a more modern design with no safety lever (decocker only) and was somewhat more reliable than the Walther with modern hollow point ammunition.
This particular pistol was made in 1986-87 in West Germany (when West Germany still existed) according to the factory, and is in mint condition. It has been test fired only and works great. It is superbly accurate. It comes with the two original 7 round factory magazines, all papers, and even the original factory test target. It has the highly desireable orange Sig factory box they used to use before going to plastic generic cases. This is a highly collectible piece of firearms history, and a must-have gun for the Sig lover. But, if you wanted to carry it for self-defense, you still could do that as well. The .380 ACP cartridge performs much better from this gun's 3.9 inch barrel than it does from something like a cheap plastic pocket wonder like a Kel-Tec or Ruger LCP, and due to its fixed barrel is stunningly accurate at long range. If you like the .380 but want to take a big step up in quality, this gun is it.
My price is relatively firm, even though there might be a small amount of wiggle room. If you have reasonable offer, let me hear it, but I have absolutely no time for low-ballers. If you have a trade in mind for a top quality handgun, let me know and we'll talk.Due to some mobility issues I have, transactions need to take place at my office in Homestead. Please don't email me telling me how far away you are. If I could travel to meet you, I would, but I can't. I'm also not sure what the distance from your place to mine has to do with the price either, but lots of people seem to think because they happen to live an hour away, my price should be lower. Here is a tip. Buy elsewhere, thanks. But if you don't mind riding to my office, I'll put on the coffee and you can handle this and maybe some other guns and if we can make a deal, we will. If not, you will have at least made a new friend. Isn't that better than meeting in some parking lot?To buy the gun, you will need a Florida Driver's License, a Concealed Handgun Permit (to bypass Miami-Dade's pesky 5 day wait) or be a law enforcement officer. You will also need cash. We'll do a Bill of Sale and trade copies of our ID's. If that does not work for you, again, buy elsewhere. Thanks a lot for looking at my listing.DUE TO THE COLLECTIBLE NATURE OF THIS FIREARM, IF YOU ARE NOT IN MY AREA, I WILL SHIP TO YOUR FFL AT YOUR EXPENSE. PLEASE INQUIRE."

That series reached 099999S in 1976, then passed 100000S and reached 101336S before it was noticed by Colt that numbers used in 1952 were being duplicated. In order to salvage the 1,336 guns already numbered past 100000S, they were hand stamped with an ""S"" prefix as well as having the ""S"" suffix, thus creating the ""Double S"" variation. All known examples are Huntsman pistols. This particular pistol is one of the 1,336 ""Double S"" pistols. The left side of the barrel is marked with the one line address, the left side of the frame is marked with the Rampant Colt over ""HUNTSMAN"" and the left side of the slide is marked ""COLT"" followed by the two line caliber designation. The serial number is marked on the right side of the frame. Blade front and windage adjustable rear sights, smooth trigger, blue Colt marked magazine and fitted with checkered walnut grips.

I know I just got it, but I'm not a huge fan of revolvers even though I keep buying them!The Mod 37 was the first ""Airweight"" revolver, actually before they came out with the name Airweight. The first ones had an aluminum cylinder and frame, but the cylinders would fail due to not being strong enough. They switched back to steel cylinders but kept the aluminum frames. This model IS one of the ones with the steel cylinders, so it's completely safe to fire.This revolver is in amazing condition. I have never fired it, not sure what the previous owner put through it but for it's age...this thing is very nice. The finish is great and it has absolutely 0 rust. There is barely a ring around the cylinder, and it locks up tighter than most new revolvers fresh out of the factory. The revolver comes with a vintage S&W Revolver box (from a different revolver though, not the original box to this one) which is also in pretty good shape!Asking $500 for this. Looking online, the only ones I can find are $500+ in beat up condition, nowhere near the great condition this one is in. I believe $500 is more than fair.Cash is preferred on this one, but I'm open to trade offers...I always like trying new things!Best way to contact me is by texting me at REDACTED or PMing me on here at any time, I always try to reply very quickly..usually within minutes.Thanks for looking!~ Mike"

Pmag.  This is a new unfired rifle that I never got around to doing anything with because of other projects.  I chose this particular AR-10 because I wanted a bit more range than a 16"" barrel would give and the medium contour barrel keeps the rifle as light as possible without compromising accuracy.  After looking over lots of ballistic data I saw no reason to go with a 20"" barrel, IMO the gain in velocity was simply not worth the extra length and weight.  Again, the rifle is new but it was purchased around three years ago or so and just sat in the safe.  The only one I could find currently listed was one on Gunbroker for $1,650 in the same stock configuration.  I do have aftermarket pistol grips and stocks I can add for a little extra, just let me know.
$1,350 in cash or will look at good trade offers.  This one cost well over $1,500 after tax and it's new. 
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and shorter in 9mm and .45 ACP and cash or??  Might also look at a Glock 19, maybe 17 with factory Glock 15rd. to 30+ round mags, prefer a Gen 4 with bright night sights, but will look at Gen 3's too.  Not looking for one that has been ""customized"", except maybe a trigger improvement.  If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.
Must be able to own a firearm in TX.  I can ship insured to another TX resident for $30 more.
Thanks for looking!"
