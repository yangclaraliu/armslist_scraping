We started with a battlefield proven Romanian parts kit with matching numbers. These parts came from an increasingly hard to find conflict rifles. All serial numbers match. The parts were mated to our fully hardened USA made a receiver that has the embossed Y and I markings of a true full auto military rifle. We do the hardening in-house using our digitally controlled kilns. These are not spot heated with a torch and a bucket of water, which will work but is not the way they are built by a real armory. To give this rifle the true look of a rifle that was picked up from the battlefield we processed this build totally different than other rifles we have offered here. After the hardening process, we did a military type packetized finish. While not as rust resistant as a cerakote rifle it is still a decent finish and leaves the rifle looking as true to an original AK47 as possible. All other parts are in the condition we received them. There is no rust on this rifle but the finish has a true working soldier finish. What this means is all the warts are there. Initials carved in the furniture, scratches, gouges, etc. One thing that is different with this rifle is the gas tube furniture has a crack along the top and is in two pieces. We will include a new gas tube furniture piece with the rifle at no additional charge. It's perfectly functional as is and the previous owner never changed this part so in the name of keeping it original we left it as is. This rifle accepts all standard AK-47 type mags, including drums. It comes with the standard 30 round magazine. We use type single hook triggers for zero trigger slap and a sweet 2-3 pound pull. The receiver is mated to the USA made black nitride barrel. This rifle has the look of the original including the crude trench art carved into the stock, handguard, and pistol grip. It has the original bayonet lug. This rifle is as close to a full auto battlefield rifle as you can legally purchase today in this country. It has just enough parts to remain 922R legal even when using surplus magazines. Full Specs: USA Black Nitride 16"" Barrel (Nitride is harder than chrome lined) Built on FULLY HARDENED USA Receiver Y and I Embossed Full Auto Pin Locations on Receiver Original Wood Furniture with Trench Art Bayonet Lug Military Parker Finish 2lb Trigger Pull Accepts all AK mags Including Drums 7.62x39 caliber Matching Serial Numbers Like most rifles, we produce this rifle is BANNED in socialist controlled states run by the Democrat party."

I can get the exact numbers later, it holds zero and has clear glass.  The bolt is super smooth and in good shape.It is chambered in .308 and i have made shots out to 700 yards with this rifle, and that is no where near the max limit.

Finish: Two tone Nickel finish
Category: Compact
Comes with all original paperwork and additional magazine firearm is in like new condition. Purchased to practice training with my Bersa Thunder .380 for plinking and realized I didn't really use it. ~300 rounds through the firearm.
Bersa of Argentina has been producing quality compact pistols chambered for the .22 Long Rifle cartridge. Firestorm are basically the same reliable Bersa pistols produced for years.
It is similar to the well known Bersa .380. The Bersa Thunder 22 offers the same reliability and accuracy, chambered for the excellent .22 Long Rifle cartridge for less recoil and lower cost ammor.
 
Compact frame and grip are sculpted perfectly for your hand. It obviously works well for smaller hands, but it is surprisingly comfortable for large shooters too.
Double-action auto pistol that holds ten cartridges in its magazine, with a total capacity of eleven.  Traditional double-action design where the first shot can be fired either by a long pull of the trigger or by thumb-cocking the hammer for a single-action pull, with subsequent shots fired in the single-action mode.

The ten shot magazine has a finger extension, to effectively lengthen the grip.
Barrel is three and five-eighths inch and is fixed to the frame – Barrel does not move with the slide at all, resulting in a very rigid barrel – and outstanding accuracy and reliability! Having a fixed breech, it gets more power from the .22 Long Rifle cartridge than does a revolver, due to the barrel/cylinder gap inherent to the revolver design.Feed ramp to the chamber is polished smooth for reliable feeding, even during extensive firing. 
Slide features a large extractor and large ejection port, resulting in excellent case extraction and reliability.
Safeties: Manual safety that disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer, and also serves as a decocking lever, which is well placed just above the gripping hand for easy reach.  Also has a magazine disconnect safety which prevents the gun from firing with the magazine removed. It also has a key-lock safety, if one so chooses to use that feature.
Magazine release button is located at the UPPER left of the trigger at the rear, and is easily operated by both right-handed and left-handed shooters."

The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots with a caliber this powerful have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the M1A™ SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armory’s® forward scout-style Picatinny mount.
