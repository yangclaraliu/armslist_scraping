I am open to just about any sort of trade you might offer as long as your offering involves ""pre-casted"", ""rim or centerfire ammo"", and a weapon that goes ""bang"" time after time by just pulling the trigger and not having to repeatedly ""ram"" projectiles down the barrel, load powder and/or pellets into the breach and primers onto the posts, etc. etc., etc. Just let me know what you have and chances are we can make a deal. These CVA's go for around $350 to $389 depending upon where you go but I could care less about an equal or fair trade as long as I can find someone who will enjoy this weapon and in return offer me a lazy man's alternative. Text to REDACTED is best but I do randomly check e-mail so you may be able to reach me that way. Good opportunity for a true ""black powder"" enthusiast to make one heck of a trade.
