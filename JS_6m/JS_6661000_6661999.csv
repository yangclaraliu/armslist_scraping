It has a few wear marks but most are showing up better in photos than they do in person. The 6940 is colts take on a monolithic upper receiver. I can say that they did a VERY good job. This rifle is very accurate. Some say they've had 1 inch groups at 100 with match ammo. (if you don't believe me just do a quick google) It has a 5.56 chamber and a 1:7 twist barrel with a sight/gas block combo (factory). The mods list is as follows... -Magpul ACS stock. (4 position tube) -Magpul ASAP sling plate -Magpul Miad grip -Enlarged Trigger Guard -BCM gunfighter charging handle -Troy rear sight. -Rubber rail covers -YHM flashider -QD sling attachment on front of rail (factory) -Vortex Strike Eagle 1-6x Illuminated Optic -Burris PEPR QD mount -Vortex 45 deg mount (future plans for mini red dot) -Accuwedge -Magpul RVG gripI would trust this rifle with my life anytime. Ive never had a single issue, although its only ever fired brass cased ammo, i would trust it with anything. Let me know what you have! I'm mainly interested in higher end ar15s (DD, LMT, AAC, etc) or the newer bull pups. However, a SCAR or Tavor is what i truly want, no matter the color or usage. 1275 w/out optic/mount, 1575 with. I would prefer ftf in lubbock or dallas TX. However, i can ship (ffl must accept from individual)! If you are in the state of Tx i can ship it to your door, provided i get a copy of DL!"

It was directly derived from the British pattern P14 enfield, which was chambered in .303 British. An interesting result of the conversion process to .30-06 caliber meant that the internal magazine can actually hold 6 rounds, instead of 5 such as is supplied by stripper clips or the M1903 springfield internal magazine.This rifle was built at Eddystone Arsenal in April 1918, which definitely would have seen use with the AEF with 7 months remaining in WWI after manufacturing date.Refurbished in WWII with the typical USMC (flaming bomb) bolt and JA barrel. Despite the military's general phasing-out of the P17 Enfield after WWI, there were still many confirmed reports of its use in WWII as well; primarily stateside for training (due to a shortage of M1 Garand's) but also to some artillery units and rear-echelon troops. This rifle's refurbishment suggests that it indeed served one of those purposes.This rifle has been pressure tested as of November 2016 and checked by multiple gunsmiths to verify its very good condition. It is fully functional and cycles and fires fantastically.The rifle, reproduction leather sling, and 10 stripper clips will be included.This rifle is being sold as-is, with no warranty implied or given. As such, I will not ship this rifle and will only meet face-to-face, so you can verify functionality of the action.Cash is king, but I will entertain all reasonable offers. I primarily enjoy rifles and unique firearms."

The JailBrake redirects muzzle blast uni-directly forward from the shooter so that users to the left or right of the rifle do not experience the typical harsh blast of from a muzzle brake on an AR type rifle. The GRY fills a void in the AR-15 market for those shooters who want a rifle that is fully field serviceable without any special tools that provides unique features not found on any AR15 on the market to date. The GRY is only available in two configurations full size (14.5"" barrel w/ pinned and welded muzzle device) and an SBR configuration (12"" barrel).

I am looking to get $750 but I am open to a trade for a 9mm plus cash. A Glock 19 and a Beretta 92FS are first on the list but I am open to others as well. If we are going to do a trade and cash I would like to keep it local. And of course the purchase needs to go through a FFL.
