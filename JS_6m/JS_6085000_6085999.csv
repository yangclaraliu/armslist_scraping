The gentleman I got if from had a very large safe, and more handguns then you can imagine, so when he told me it may have 50 rounds through it, I had no reason to disbelieve him, and the conditon of the gun speaks to that as well. This is in extremely good condition. The only reason I am parting with it, is that a few days after I purchased it, I ended up buying  a Dan Wesson Guardian, which is also a bobtail pistol.

The bore and the chambers are perfect and shine brightly. From the slight turn line, it appears to have been shot very little.  Factory original color case hardened trigger and hammer.  The sale also includes a new 50 round box of American Eagle ammo, which is a $50 value.  This revolver is priced to sell.  It is really a great gun at a price that you might never be able to replicate.  Face to face sale in Central Ohio.  CCW preferred.  Email me or text at REDACTED."
