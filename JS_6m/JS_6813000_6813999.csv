I'm not in a rush to sell it, I just ended up with a similar 1911 due to a trade, so I don't have a need for this gun now.The lighting is harsh in the pics. Anything that looks like rust or gunk or any significant cosmetic issue isn't really there. The gun is in excellent shape, there are a couple of minor scuffs. The slide and frame coloration don't quite match, but it looks fine. The only flaw is that the front sight tilts a little to one side. It doesn't affect aim. Rear sight is adjustable.The gun has an Auto Ordnance frame, Remington Rand slide (refinished and no longer obviously Remington Rand - slide is not suitable as a collector's item), Colt barrel and other U.S. parts, many of them USGI.It's very reliable. I shot an entire box of Remington Golden Sabers through it on Saturday without a hitch.At listed price/trade value, it comes with the FDE Magpul grips you see in the pic plus the original GI-style Auto Ordnance brown plastic grips, two GI-type magazines and a 25-round unopened box of Remington Golden Saber hollow points.You must have NC DL and either NC CHP or PPP that I will retain, no exceptions."

This is a mid 90's Intratec Sport 22 chambered in 22LR. This is the 22LR version of the (in)famous Intratech Tech 9 that caused quite the stir just prior to the Clinton Assault Weapons Ban in 1995. Production of the 22LR variant was very limited. What makes this an even rarer find is it's in near perfect condition, comes with the original Intratec hard plastic case, which is also in excellent condition, and it also has the factory user manual. Also included are factory 10 and 25 round magazines. The magazines are also Ruger 10/22 pattern. I've not seen any Intratech pistols in this good of condition in years. To find one with all the goodies in this condition is almost nonexistent. The only thing missing is the lock and I'm not even 100% sure these came with padlocks. If you're a collector of rare and oddball firearms then this is right up your ally! Gun Broker is all over the place with the few listings they had for these and none of them were in this condition. So we're going to price this one at $450 and go from there! If you have any questions or would like some more pictures of this firearm, email me directly at REDACTED or call me at the shop and ask for Brent. REDACTED!

Selling because I'm saving up for a VCOG or other quality variable power optic. This ACOG is perfect though for speed and precision from close range to mid range, as it is so incredibly lightweight (very close to most micro dot sights) -- much unlike larger scopes, especially variable power. Used gently only, in perfect like-new condition.
I am *unlikely* to accept trades except for ultra high end 1-6x or 1-8x optics. No trades for pistols, rifles, ammo, vehicles, etc."

The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken! Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver."

Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles. The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers. The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems. Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life. But unlike the HK416, the MR556A1 does not use a chrome-lined barrel. Chrome-lining can sometimes mask bore imperfections and negatively affect accuracy. For the new series of Heckler & Koch semi-automatic MR rifles, HK designers and engineers believe best accuracy comes with an unlined bore. Used with the HK Free Floating Rail System, the barrel does not touch the handguard, ensuring the barrel is truly free-floating for maximum accuracy. The unchromed barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately “swagged” with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. The thick, heavy contour 16.5-inch MR556A1 barrel also contributes to its excellent accuracy. A precise enhanced two-stage trigger adds significantly to the accuracy of the MR556A1 and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a telescopic sight easier. The retractable buttstock can be locked into a solid, non-moving position by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock. Special target rifle takedown pins ensure the upper and lower receivers are firmly mated for accurate performance. Designed to function with a wide variety of high quality 5.56 x 45 mm ammunition, the MR556A1 uses a C.I.P. dimensioned chamber (a chamber with dimensions specified by the Commission Internationale Permanente).The MR556A1 also functions reliably with most quality Caliber .223 Remington ammunition. The MR556A1 is being produced with the same commitment to quality as German-made HK firearms. By using joint U.S./German manufacturing, Heckler & Koch leverages the relative strengths of two continents to make the preeminent AR-type firearm, combining the designs innovations of the USA and Germany into one new product."

IC-A5 SBR
Individual Carbine
Directly descended from the rifles developed by LWRCI to meet the requirements for the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program, the IC-A5 is built for high performance.  The IC-A5 SBR model delivers the same great features, fit and function of the full size IC-A5 in a compact 10.5"" barrel configuration

The IC-A5 SBR  is the latest model in the IC  Individual Carbine series. Customers called for an adjustable gas block and user configurable rail system on the same rifle. We listened- the IC-A5 SBR is designed with a low profile 2 position adjustable gas block allowing the shooter to compensate for running a suppressor with the added benefit of our longer modular rail system. 

The Monoforge upper receiver with LWRCI modular rail system is stronger and lighter.  Access to the gas piston system is quick and easy by loosening 2 thumb screws on the IC-A5 SBR.  This IC-A5 SBR brings together the best features of the IC Enhanced and IC-SPR in one compact SBR package.

Like all IC models the IC-A5 SBR is constructed using the highest quality materials, built on our patented self-regulating short-stroke gas piston system, machined from materials that belong to the super alloy family of steel alloys most often used in aerospace, LWRCI raises the bar on reliability and ease of maintenance- delivering the highest level of performance. 

Dual Control fully ambidextrous lower receiver includes bolt catch and release, magazine release and fire control access from both sides of the IC-A5 SBR.  LWRCI Enhanced Fire Control Group comes standard.  Our investment castings are x-rayed for imperfections and nickel-boron coated for a smooth crisp trigger pull with positive reset.  

Our IC-A5 SBR uses LWRCI manufactured- NiCorr treated cold Hammer Forged standard barrel.  The LWRCI Nickel-boron coated bolt carrier delivers unparalleled wear resistance, corrosion resistance and permanent lubricity.  



The LWRCI IC-A5 SBR comes complete with, LWRCI Skirmish Back Up Iron Sights, LWRCI Ambidextrous Charging Handle, LWRCI Adjustable Compact Stock, MagpulÃ�Â® MOE+ Grip and LWRCI High Efficiency 4-Prong Flash Hider."
