The rifle  has double set triggers, which function flawless with an extremely light break when set.  This rifle also features Suhler Einhackmontage or claw mounts for the scope - meaning the scope can be removed to shoot with the iron sights or for traveling and then placed back on the rifle in 3 seconds with no change in zero.  These claw mounts have been modified with standard US 1"" rings, which allow any American made scope to be used on the rifle.  A very nice feature which cannot be found in most claw mounts.  This rifle also comes with an El Paso made Weaver K4 with standard fine crosshair.  Optics are very good.  The rifle is extensively engraved, with the builders name stamped into the barrel.  A 'butterknife' or 'spoon' bolt handle enhances the elegance of this prewar German sporting rifle.  The bore is good with high lands, however there is some darkness in the groove.  The rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser.  The front sight has been modified to accept both the enlongated sight insert as well as a typical barleycorn side to side sight insert.  No inserts are included with the rifle and should be customized to the buyers preference.  The original stock is missing, however the rifle comes in a very lovely military Mauser stock with almost perfect inletting and an extensive amount of tiger stripe figure.  Additional pictures of anything on the rifle - just ask.  Any questions you may have, just shoot me an email.  Check out the Husqvarna rifles I also have for sale.I will ship the rifle at the buyer's expense, but only to an authorized FFL.  If you are a PA resident, we can discuss further options.See my other ads for some other interesting old guns.Trade interests (I can add cash on my end or you can depending on the trade): BRNO sporter rifles, Oberndorf sporter rifles, BRNO 16 gauge sidelock, French shotguns ( Manufrance, Robust, Ideal, others) SKB 280e with English stock in 20, 28, or 410 V.

Retail is $170. Specifications Output / Runtime -- White Light High 300 .0 lumens / 1.5 hours Med 60 .0 lumens / 7.0 hours Low 15 .0 lumens / 13.0 hours Weight w/Batteries 3 .5 ounces Batteries One 123A *Runtime until output drops below 10% of maximum output at this setting Description The robust, always accessible 2211X is the lightest weight, most affordable member of SureFire’s category-redefining WristLight family. Developed over years with input from active-duty police officers and other hardcore users, this compact, lightweight wrist-worn light boasts a proprietary reflector that shapes the light from its virtually indestructible LED into a wide, perfect MaxVision Beam™—ideal for closer-range tasks—at three useful levels: 300, 60, and 15 lumens. And because it’s strapped to your wrist, the 2211X is always ready for action since it won’t get lost, dropped, or left behind when you need it most. Just press the 2211X’s pushbutton switch once to unleash all 300 lumens. When paired with a handgun, it’s more than enough light to identify targets and to overwhelm a threat’s dark-adapted vision at close range. And the LED has been ingeniously positioned so that it automatically aligns to illuminate a closer-range target when worn on the support hand wrist and used in a standard two-handed grip. Or press and hold the same switch to cycle to the longer-runtime 60- and 15-lumen settings that are ideal for a wide range of non-tactical close-range tasks such as loading gear, working on a car, or making your way around a dark house when the power goes out. The 2211X is constructed from a durable, lightweight polymer that resists impact, is non-conductive, and corrosion-proof. An adjustable rugged nylon wristband keeps the light securely strapped to your wrist, so instant illumination is never more than a button press away. Powered by a single disposable 123A battery that can provide up to 13 hours of useful illumination, the 2211X makes a great everyday-carry or backup light that’s as convenient and comfortable to have on you 24/7 as your favorite watch. Always on you, and immediately accessible—no matter what. Features: Virtually indestructible LED regulated to maximize output and runtime Faceted reflector creates flawless MaxVision Beam™ that’s broad and evenly dispersed, perfect for close-range applications Ergonomic, intuitive pushbutton switch delivers max output on first press; or can cycle through lower levels with a sustained press Construction—lightweight, durable polymer body; adjustable nylon wristband Securely straps to support-hand wrist for instant access and automatic alignment with handgun when using a standard two-handed grip Includes two disposable, high-energy 123A lithium battery with 10-year shelf life.  I will ship at buyer's expense once payment has been received via paypal or USPS money order."

Way cheaper to shoot than firing 5.56 or 223, plus much more punch! If you're unfamiliar with these rifles, check out the video on youtube (PSA KS47 -vs- CMMG Mutant).The PSA KS47 is based on the AR15, and combines the modular construction, accuracy and precision of the AR platform with the stopping power and the magazine options of the AK.
