The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game. Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec  Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports.

Awesome shooting rifle with lots of nice parts. FN stainless barrel, Leupold VX2 scope etc. I have this rifle setup for minimum recoil, minimum moving action for suprressor shooting (suppressor not included!!) and it is awesomely quiet. If you have a suppressor or considering it with the likely reclassification of suppressors under NFA this is a great platform to use. Only reason I'm consider selling is I am starting a very custom build and need the money. Price is firm, not looking for trades. Please, don't waste my time if you're not serious. This is a repeat listing because too many time wasters out there. Prefer CWP, ftf, cash in hand sale in Greenville, Pickens, or somewhere in between. Thank you."

The Slide Fire Solutions SSAK-47 XRS Bump Fire Buttstock utilizes the same groundbreaking design and technology as the SSAR-15 line of stocks, offering the same level of performance, reliability, and superior craftsmanship for the more economical AK-47 platform of rifles. The SSAK-47 allows the shooter to safely bump fire their AKM-pattern rifle from the shoulder, effectively and legally simulating fully automatic fire, and allowing for an unprecedented measure of control that is severely lacking when attempting to bump fire a rifle in the traditional, ""from-the-hip"" manner. The SSAK-47 features a shelf that positions the shooter's index finger in a fixed position in front of the rifle's trigger. To fire, the rifle is moved forward with the support hand pushing on the forend, thereby bringing the trigger to the shooter's finger and discharging a round. The rifle's recoil causes it to move rearward, allowing the trigger mechanism to reset. When the right amount of constant forward pressure is applied, the rifle will continue to fire as the trigger is brought forward and depressed by the shooter's stationary index finger, causing the gun to Bump Fire. With a little practice, the shooter will be capable of delivering accurate single shots, bursts, or even full magazine dumps on demand using the SSAK-47. The SSAK-47 employs a simple stock locking mechanism that allows shooters to select between their preferred firing methods easily and quickly. In the extended or ""Open"" position, the rifle's receiver is allowed to freely slide rearward during the recoil impulse into the hollow stock, thereby allowing the gun to be bump fired. The stock may also be locked into a collapsed, or ""Closed,"" position into which the Interface Block attached the gun's receiver is held in place within the hollow stock and unable to move, thereby facilitating semi-auto function. The SSAK-47 is designed to be compatible with most Stamped Receiver, Fixed Stock AK-47 and AK-74 rifle variants, as well as Saiga Rifles and Shotguns that have been converted from their imported sporting configurations to accept a pistol grip. Stock is NOT compatible with Milled Receiver rifles or those with Underfolding or Side-Folding buttstocks. No permanent modifications or gunsmithing required! SSAK-47 assembly includes the XRS Stock, Interface Block, Nut Retainer, Hex Key, Mounting Hardware, Instructions, BATFE Approval Letter, and a Lifetime Factory Warranty. Made in the USA. Technical Information:Model: SSAK-47 XRSStock Material: Reinforced High Strength PolymerCompatibility: Stamped Receiver, Fixed Stock AK-47/AK-74 variants, Converted Saiga Rifles & ShotgunsNOTE: The Left Hand Model has a fixed finger shelf located on the right side of the stock.

The DC model is upgraded from the factory with nicer grips, all black finish and unbelievable Night Sights. Only 50 rounds through this Safe Queen in Excellent condition. I'm not a dealer just a fan. Three magazines included as well as all factory paperwork and box. Earlier Solos had FTE issues but this is a late serial number DC model built in 2016. Priced right too. Retail is $825 but CASH IS KING, first $575 takes it.  These DC models will only go up in value!  James REDACTED"

The reason being, is that it has a faulted frame. The piece of metal that once held the slide release safely in place somehow has broken off, the spring itself now is not safely secured. Meaning that when fired it is likely to not engage the slide release downward, catching the slide not allowing to cycle the next round. I've had work done on it by a local gunsmith, such as having the front sight drilled and colored and putting on brand new factory grips. I personally upgraded to a new firearm, and just wish to move on with selling the Bersa as is. I'm positive that a gunsmith could fix the issue. I have also taken the liberty to take pictures of the problem. On the brighter side it is an accurate pistol, feels good in the hand and you can't go wrong with 45 as a defensive round. Before it broke, I could spend hours at the range chewing through ammo. With it comes the original box, papers, 3 factory magazines, a custom IWB holster and a special key that locks the internals of the firearm itself. This will be a good starter gun once it’s repaired. This is also up for trade. Feel free to contact me over email, or phone. 1REDACTED"
