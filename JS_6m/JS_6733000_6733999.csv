If you have a 4 or 6 inch 686 pre-lock with factory walnut target grips in excellent condition; I would trade this gun even for it.However, if you have a 686 with a lock, has rubber grips, or it is a 7 shot; I would still be interested in it if it is excellent shape, but you would need to put cash with it to trade for this 1911.

I been kicking this idea around. But if you offer a trade it has to include a set-up ready to shoot, so it must include a pump or bottle.Micro pistols… maybe if you have something interesting.

It is finished in Mossy Oak bottomlands camo. It has a 26"" inch barrel with interchangeable fiber optic front sight. Comes with two chokes, extra full turkey and over decoys. With it I will include a sling and a few boxes of 3 1/2"" #5 turkey loads. Bought this last fall thinking of taking up turkey hunting but have now decieded against it. Again this gun has never even been fired. I'm looking to trade it and am open to offers. I may sell it so cash offers are welcome but I would prefer a trade. I am wiling to travel a short distance for a transaction and other party will need to show an Ohio drivers license or state ID card. CCW card would be preferable and all laws apply.

I been kicking this idea around. But if you offer a trade it has to include a set-up ready to shoot, so it must include a pump or bottle.Micro pistols… maybe if you have something interesting.

If you have a 4 or 6 inch 686 pre-lock with factory walnut target grips in excellent condition; I would trade this gun even for it.However, if you have a 686 with a lock, has rubber grips, or it is a 7 shot; I would still be interested in it if it is excellent shape, but you would need to put cash with it to trade for this 1911. Cash price is $1050.I’m in the mood to trade and here are some things I’m interested in.:Smith & Wesson K or L frame revolvers in .357Mag. 686, 19, 66, etc. Not really interested in J-frames unless it’s a stainless .357Mag.Older(70’s) Belgium Browning Hi-PowerPCP Air Rifles. I been kicking this idea around. But if you offer a trade it has to include a set-up ready to shoot, so it must include a pump or bottle.Micro pistols… maybe if you have something interesting. I’d like to stay away from .380 but haven’t ruled them out.Not interested in Black Powder, Pump shotguns, archery, or anything in rough condition. Money can go either way. If we trade firearms I require ID showing you are a Tennessee Resident 21 or over and a signed bill of sale (I will provide). I’m in the Murfreesboro/Shelbyville area."

A few months after purchasing the rifle I was diagnosed with a lung disease that restricts my physical ability. This rifle is beautifully made with the famous Model 70 Pre-'64 type claw extrator with positive Controlled Round Feeding in matt stainless, 3 position safety, aluminum bedded Bell & Carlson lay-up composite synthetic stock with sculptured check piece for positive scope alignment, M.O.A. trigger system, Packmayr decelerator recoil pad and stainless steel fluted 22"" barrel with recessed target crown. With premium ammo you can expect it to shoot 1 MOA. I will pay shipping to your FFL in lower 48 states."

Personally have fired about 100 rounds through it, and is the funnest gun I own, just looking to sell it and buy something bigger... Iron sights on this gun, no scope, but is drilled/tapped for a scope base. Have shot 2 Inch groups at 100yards with the irons being right on target. Gun is in overall good condition, no issues. Recoil is not bad with the brake, have shot 20 rounds in a range session without too much shoulder pain. 115 Loaded rounds included (about $500 worth of ammo). Theres about 50 500gr loads and the rest are 300gr handloads. Also included is about 100 300gr projectiles and 42 pieces of 1x fired brass and reloading dies. If the buyer so requests I can load up the fired brass prior to sale (Would make a total of 157 rounds, ~$650 of ammo) Has a recoil pad on the back. I dont need to sell this gun, just seeing if I can get some money to upgrade to something else. With that said I would be willing to possibly trade for anything in the following calibers: 300/338 RUM, 338/378/416 Weatherby, 50 Peacekeeper/BMG. Feel free to shoot me a trade offer, worst I can say is not interested. Asking $1050, which includes everything listed above. Buyer must have valid NJ-DL and FID. Selling out of Milford, NJ but Commute to New Brunswick Daily. Note: One of the photos shows a size comparison of the round (223,308, 300gr 458 mag, 500gr 458 mag, 338 Lapua)"
