I am NOT in a rush to buy, as I really dont even need this gun, so I wont entertain anything over $500. If you feel your pre owned (even if it has 5 rounds through it) is worth $10 less than a brand new in box gun from the store including transfer fee, I am not your buyer. If you are hoping to cash in on pre election panic, I am not your buyer.  If you realize the average great condition used Glock pricing for pretty much all models (except the cheaper 42 / 43) falls between $450 -500 and you have one within this range, I would be interested in hearing about what you have. As someone who buys and sells Glocks a dozen times a year on here and armslist, I know what they can be had for and what I have sold for, so serious inquires only.......

Adjustments are standard with the Nightforce low profile ZeroHold feature, and available in .1 Mrad (12 Mils per revolution) or .25 MOA (30 MOA per revolution) increments. A capped windage adjustment helps prevent accidental adjustment in the field. The parallax adjustment is marked with approximate numbered distances and is coupled with DigIllum digital reticle illumination. The eyepiece features enhanced engraving, an integrated Power Throw Lever (PTL) and an XtremeSpeed thread for making a fast diopter adjustment. All of these features are paired with intelligent, Nightforce F1, first focal plane, reticles that provide for fast hold-off adjustments and precise ranging calculations."""

Only $2800 I can't go any less sorry I already lowered the price from $4000. It's estimated to be worth between $5000-$6000. These are hard to find just as a mountain gun and to add the fact old style 4 bolt frame stock was used makes this a extremely rare gem! This one is even more rare because it's blued also during the introduction the factory used up old 4 bolt frame stock only an estimated 30-60 exist! These were not sold as limited 4 bolt model 29's later after they had been introduced people started to discover and confirm that the Smith and Wesson factory had used old ""classic"" stock and it was only done with the blued framed. There is really no way to compair pricing because none have came up for sale. I was told the last one was sold at over $8000 and that was ten years ago. Buy it and place it into collection or post in on line for $5000 and make some money. I would like to trade for two smith and Wesson revolvers.The standard limited production was 2500. These are priced between $1200-$1600 on line. However most are stainless very few are blued mountain guns they are much more rare than stainless. There seems to be several of these avalible when I say several, maybe 3-4 total the rest are charished by there owners. I have read several forums about the rare 4 bolt mountain guns and again these were only in blued finish. I can't compare pricing but I was told not to take less than $4000 for it. I don't collect guns I use them and shoot regularly. Anyway I am looking to trade for maybe two model 29's 629's or other similar revolvers. I am not a fan of auto pistols sorry but I might consider one with a revolver. I would alsoconsider Taurus recolvers as well. I would do a straight trade for a S&W 500 performance model."

Bought brand new in January of 2016 and have put over 300 factory manufactured 147 grained manufactured ammunition( no reloads). Only cosmetic scratches to composite black stock and affixed sling stud mount to the front stock hole opening to mount Harris style Bipod. Scewed in and attached with red loctite glue so to stabalize bipod mount under extereme heat and pressure. Iron Sight are extremely accurate out of the box and hits bulls eye from 100-200 yards without optical sights. Want to upgrade to a Super Match model to utilize iincreased presision customization for competition shooting at long distance and high powered Optical Scopes which costs 3-4 times more. I wish to sell this fine rifle to subsidize my investment in the upgraded, more expensive models. This is a great rifle and a favorite in accuracy and reliability but let my fascination with buying the more expensive customized versions be your benefit for one of the best American, Semi-Automatic, accurate and reliable rifles on the market at a great price. Used unversally by LEO and Military as a semi automatic sniper rifle, you will not be disappointed since their prices do not fluctuate through time. I would prefer local( to Houston) purchasers, but will only deal through my own FFL sealer and your own FFL dealer to transfer the and ship the firearm. Comes with original box and mauals and 10 round magazine. Prefer local transactions so we can use my own or your preferred FFL licensed dealer or if you have a Concealed Carry Licence for the exchange. Background check for my FFL contact will be paid by myslef. Let my vanity for the best of the best be your opportunity to purchase a great rifle with a great history of performance and reliability at alower price and probably have the same accuracy and reliability at short to medium distance. For now, with the political climate I do not want to transfer to a non-second ammendment friendly state, other than Texas for now. I am sorry but want to try local and then see if there is interest outside the state."
