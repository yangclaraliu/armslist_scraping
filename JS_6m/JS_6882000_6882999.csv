Trade value of everything is around 900.00 so keep it fair please.  I would also entertain a good full size semi auto handgun of quality make in 9mm, .40 or .45 with cash on your end depending on the make and condition, or a pistol and good tactical 12 gauge shotgun.  Thanks for looking!  I have photos, just contact me and I will send them to you."

This one is the manual safety model with standard 3 dots for sights and is DA/SA. Can be left ""locked and cocked"" like a 1911, or at half cock for a lighter first trigger pull, or even have the hammer all the way down for a really safe way to carry. It's your preference. Safety can only be engaged at full cock though.Feels great in my hands, and looks great so I literally purchased it brand new a week ago from my local gun store to give it a shot (ba dum tss). I couldn't find a range that had one in stock that I could rent so I bought it to try something new. Shoots great, no issues at all out of it, but I can't shoot it as well as I shoot a Glock so I want to go back to what I know works better for me personally.I've put 200rds through it at the range (went two times this week and shot 100rds each time with zero issues). I've cleaned it and put it back in it's brand new box.Comes with everything from the factory. Paperwork, two mags (10rd flush and a 14rd extended), and the cleaning rod/brush. I also have some aftermarket Elk stag grips that come with it too that you can use if you like the look of them (looks very similar to Ivory).Comes loaded with Federal Premium 124gr HST (the perfect bullet for a 3"" barrel 9mm in my honest opinion)Looking to trade for a Gen 3 subcompact model Glock *prefer unmodified* +$100 cash, or sell it for $550 cash. (literally purchased BNIB for over $600 at the store on 5/19, and have the receipt) Will entertain substitute of cash for ammo, extra mags, or conversion barrels (if applicable) with a trade.Any questions, requests for more pictures, or offers just text me at REDACTED.

I will include 80 rounds of ammo, 75 of which are hollow points. Included are 2 holsters. The one seen in the photos and a smaller Don Hume slide style leather holster that allows the barrel to protrude through the bottom of it. The action is tight on this and the trigger is perfect & smooth. I personally have never handled/shot a revolver with this smooth of an action/cylinder. The bore is in great shape as well. There are some spots on the cylinder where the bluing has been worn away from repeated insertion/removal of the holster. Most of these spots are on the cylinder and a minimal amount at the muzzle of the barrel. I would rate it's conditon as 8.5/10 and I am likely being overly strict with it. Trade Interests:I am mainly looking to trade down to a lesser valued gun with cash added on your end, but I could potentially do a straight trade.

I've got too many firearms now.Aimpoint Micro T-2 MOA Sight - The Aimpoint Micro T-2 is the latest and greatest offering from Aimpoint, and is testament to the Aimpoint's constant pursuit of improvement! This cutting edge red dot has a host of new features, from enhanced lens coatings that radically improve the shape and clarity of the 2MOA dot to a heavily ruggedized housing for even greater protection. The combination of advanced optical lenses and new lens coatings reflect the dot's selected frequency of red light at nearly 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy, while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass through with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest, brightest image possible, allowing for use with all generations of night vision, as well as improved clarity when coupled with a magnifier! Last but not least, Aimpoint has added flip-up front and rear lens covers to the optic to protect the lenses from nearly any weather conditions you may encounter in the field or on the range.why buy a Trijicon MRO, primary arms, sig, Romeo, Eotech, when you can have the best?"

Built around a Cold Hammer Forged, 16” barrel, the V7 has a DD improved Flash Suppressor to reduce flash signature. The mid-length gas system provides smooth and reliable cycling under any condition and reduces both perceived recoil and wear on moving parts. A free-floating MFR XS 15.0 handguard offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. With the M-LOK attachment points that run along 7 positions and an uninterrupted 1913 Picatinny rail on top, the V7 has plenty of room for the sights, optics, and accessories the user may require. The rifle is finished off with the rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

This gun was made for the USAF between 1981-84 before the 92fs mass production models. The model 92SB is rare but a compact 92SBc is even more rare. All 92SBc models were Made in Italy. I have (4) original beretta mags. All mags were made in Italy. (3) 13+1 mags and (1) 15+1 extended mag. (these are not aftermarket mags)This is a collectors gun. I have never seen a beretta with a better finish, it's beautiful especially for over 30 years old. Bore is clean and riflings look new. It shoots, and functions like a sewing machine. Smooth and accurate like a beretta is suppose to be. It's amazing how easy you can rack the slide. The gun is equipped with a hi-viz yellow dot front sight. Great sight picture. 750$ cash - Looking for a target model 1911 with adjustable sights. Maybe a Glock 19/17 gen 4 +cash. Email me me your number and I'll text you back. FTF in Tulsa metro ONLY."
