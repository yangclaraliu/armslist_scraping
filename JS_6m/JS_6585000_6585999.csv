Instantly dropped the rifle into an old school m14 stock and put this one up. Might have a few handling marks on it. Not sure. I'll also throw in a B-Square mount for free. $200 in or around Winston. Please email REDACTED or text Dave at REDACTED for response. Usually in the bed pretty early for work so I may not respond instantly. Many thanks and God bless!"
