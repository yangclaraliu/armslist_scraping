Please read and let me know which option(s) you are wanting to buy or trade(higher in trade value) for, so I know the deal, please don't make me guess because I will guess in my favor.  Not interested in taking any less than the posted prices, if it does not sell, I'll just keep it to go along with an AR9 build.  Pics included with different options.  If you think the prices are high, please look up the parts and work before contacting me, there was around $1,200 spent on the complete package, not including the finish as I know it's not for everyone.  If you are looking to spend what a plain Glock .40 or 9mm goes for, there are plenty of those listed.  This one is priced very fair, Thanks!
$700 firm in cash or higher in trade for the above listed.
$760 with the Raven Concealment Magwell(cost $95 new) included.
$880 with Lone Wolf threaded 9mm barrel & thread protector($140) and 15rd.+2 9mm Glock mag($35)
Prefer cash right now, but might consider trades, depending on the deal.  Please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??  If you don't mention a cash amount or other item(s) either way, I will assume you want a straight trade and respond accordingly.
Mostly interested in semi-autos, but will consider others, depending on the deal.  Items I could use more of, AR FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger & Law Tactical Gen 3-M folding adapter.  Also, a 9""+/- 5.56 upper, a few side charging uppers, 9mm stripped lowers similar to the Joe Bob's Spartan I have now and maybe an AR pistol in .45ACP or parts.  Could also use several factory Glock 33rd. 9mm mags in new/like new condition.
Must be legally able to own a firearm in TX.  Please, no lowballers, scammers or flakes!

The only one I've seen is on gunbroker for 1,200 but I'm not out to rob anyone. Just keep in mind that these aren't made anymore. So feel free to offer. The scope, bases, and rings are $200 because that's what I have in it. So include that in your offer and specify if you want the scope. If not I will assume you don't want it. Bipod not included. I will trade for a nice over under with removable chokes in preferably 12 gauge but may do a 20 gauge also. Any other trades just email me with offer. I'll say yes or no either way. Thanks"

I sold the original 1-9 twist upper back in January and replaced it with a PSA Stainless heavy barrel with 1-7 twist, 16'' midlength gas system.  5.56 chamber. Forward assist and dust cover.  The new upper has 84 rounds on it so far.  A2 stock and magpul moe pistol grip.  Comes with 1 gen 2 pmag and 1 gen 3 pmag, both 30 round.  Also includes a mil surp carry handle sight and caldwell shell catcher bag.  I never zeroed the carry handle sight on this upper.  Aside from a small scratch on the shell deflector, I'm pressed to find any scratches on this rifle. It is in EXCELLENT CONDITION  It includes a mounted and zeroed 3-9 power no name scope.  Not sure on the make of the scope, it came as part of a combo on a 308 bolt action.  It would not hold a zero with the recoil of the 308, so for kicks I threw it on this rifle. Probably around 200 rounds on the scope between this upper and the original upper and it's held a zero fine.  I have grown bored with 5.56/223 so I figured I'd see if there is interest.  $500 CASH ONLY, price is firm.  Selling to fund a 1911.  Weekdays I can normally meet between 11am and 4pm, free after 5pm Saturdays and all day on Sundays.  Depending on time, will drive up to an hour to complete sale.IF IT'S LISTED IT'S AVAILABLE"

This is a Palmetto State Armory PA-10 complete rifle chambered in .308/7.62x51.

My list price will be for the rifle plus a Silencerco muzzle brake, BCM gunfighter AR10 charging handle, Magpul MIAD grip and Magpul STR butt stock. Those things are currently on the rifle and make it look and feel better in my opinion so I consider those must have upgrades but they did cost me money so some of that will be added to the price I paid for the plain complete rifle. Here are the specs on the upper from PSA's website:PSA Gen2 PA10 18"" Midlength .308 WIN 1:10 Melonite 15"" M-lok Upper - with BCG and CH -516445087I have the original flash hider, grip and adjustable butt stock which will also be provided to the buyer of the complete rifle. The asking price for the complete rifle as shown is $1,000 and I just dropped the price from $1,100 down to 1k on 3/17/17. I also have a brand new Vortex 6-24x50 FFP scope and the Midwest Industries QD mount if wanted but those bring another $1,000 into the equation. I have three 25 round gen 3 pmags which I will give to whoever buys the complete rifle as is for $1,000. That's about $100 gift to you. I also have around 500 rounds of quality boxed factory ammo if wanted and I will sell all for .50 a round and there is some match grade ammo included in that count. I have very limited trade interests at the moment: BCM 300 blk upper or complete pistol or a IWI X95 Gen2 Tavor."

Box, lock, both mags, different grips, papers etc. As you can see from the photos I purchased it new from Cabela's in 03/02/2014. If you want it let me know. My preferred FFL for transfers is Sound Loan in Everett (the charge $25 I believe), but if you have a different place in mind let me know. If it's not out of the way I'm happy to accommodate.

The wood does not have to be nice guns are ment to be used so some character scratches are ok with me even a few chunks dont matter so much I just want a 28 gauge to hunt with seeing as my neck injury limits my ability to use the 12 or 20 to much and I just like the 28 very well.  If any one has one I am willing to pay a fair price just make me an offer if you have one. You can reach me at my email, or by text REDACTED. If you want more then my listed price well you can contact me but the local flea market has one for 200.00 could have bought it today if I wanted, not looking to spend twice what they cost new in 2012 for a used gun unfired or not. I will intertain other 28 gauge models such as 870 Remington 1100 Remington or other older single barrels and willing to be fair with the price of those as well but I am not looking for a collecters item or a resale just a good hunting gun thank you."

I want to stick with 9mm and 3gun competitions. Has fully adjustabe target sigts, a ramped match barrel, full length gude rod and an adjustable trigger. It is a Canadian made version so it is higher quality when they moved their factory into the states. This gun has a tuned slide release and some mags were tuned to remove the slide lock for competition use. It comes with 8 mags. 5 are canadian made with extensions, (3 factory para extensions, 2 brand new Dawson HiCap extensions with new springs), 2 mecgar mags, and 1 9mm mag I used for a stage start load to get an extra round into the gun at start. The gun also comes with 2 mag pouches and a bladetech holster and just over 400rnds of ammo. Most of it being hollow point stuff. If you are wanting to get into action pistol shooting on a budget this setup will be a great start. All you need to do is add a belt of your choice or run a stiff leather belt and you are competing.Asking $700obo I am in Louisville and Lexington frequently so I can meet either place easily. Email me for more pictures, I can take pictures of whatever you want on the gun, holster, mags, or ammo.The only trades I am looking for are a Dillon 550, 650, or 1050 or a glock mag 9mm AR. Don't bother asking if I want to trade for anything else unless its heavily in my favor. I can work a little if buyer doesn't want as many mags or belt gear."

My asking price or trade value is about 700. Just shoot me a reply with your offer and I'll let you know what I think. Please, no lowball offers. I'm not desparate to let go of it so give me a fair and reasonable offer if you expect a reply.This gun is in great shape with only a few boxes of ammo through it. No scratches or dings to speak of on either the stainless slide or the poly frame. The gun has had the springs replaced recently since I'm not sure if the others were original to the gun. It has tritium insert night sights which will glow bright and have plenty of life left. I will include a Bianchi OWB leather holster, a second 10 round magazine, and some various ammo. You'll get about 50 rounds of fmj target ammo, 20 Hornady critical duty +P, and some federal JHP ammo. What I am interested in are other pistols. Pistols must be in good working order and of equal value. If you have something worth a little more and wants cash on my end, let me know what you expect in addition and we can go from there. If you wish to do the reverse, that's fine too.  I'm not terribly interested in revolvers, rifles or shotguns but I suppose the worst I could do is say no. I do like military arms and such but cash is king Thanks for looking and let me know what you have or if you would like additional pictures"
