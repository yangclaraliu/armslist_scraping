I took it to a friends house and gave her a ride and she commented how it went more places than her Kawasaki Mule.It has about 70 miles on it and most of those are from running up to Walmart and back. Your supposed to get 30miles to a charge and more times you run it all the way down the better the charge holds. The only downside to this UTV is it sat out over at moms house the summer before last and the cammo decal on the hood qrinkled up so I shot it with a little olive drab.

It has a beautiful case-hardened receiver, 28"" barrel and deluxe checkered walnut furniture. This shoots paper cartridges that are easy to make by hand without any reloading presses. It shoots any standard 54 caliber bullet or ball, and is primed with musket caps. Comes with the reloading dowel that is the same diameter as the chamber, for wrapping the nitrate paper around. Also comes with a bunch of nitrate paper, about a dozen loaded cartridges, can of some musket caps, new padded case and original manual, paperwork and easy directions for making paper rounds.  The blueing and case hardening is probably in 98% or better, and the stock is about the same, with only safe-queen wear. No damage or corrosion.  The buttplate is steel, and the rear sight is a flip-up leaf-style with marks out 800 or 1000 yards.  The front sight is a soldered post that will accommodate a period spike bayonet.This gun has always been cleaned and oiled after each use. Also, the gas check plate on this rifle moves freely as it should, and is in good condition.Overall a very nice example of a 1863 Sharps. Since it's primed with a musket cap, legally it's a black powder rifle so no transfer (or transfer fee!) is required. I live near Mt Vernon, Burlington, Sedro-Woolley, and can meet you near I-5.  Sorry, I'm not looking for any trades, and the price is firm.As long as there are no restrictions on black powder firearms in your state, I can ship it to your door.  Looking at the USPS website, it looks like it would cost about $45 to ship it to the east coast; probably less for closer states.  I can give you an exact shipping quote if you let me know your zip code.Thanks for looking, and have a great day!"
