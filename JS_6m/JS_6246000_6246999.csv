The most special attraction on this Jewel however is that it features custom professionally lengthened forcing cones done by highly respected/old fashioned method - Master Gunsmith Jerry White, from Fort Collins Colorado; who's one of only a handful of Smiths in the country who's been lengthening forcing cones for over 50 years. This treatment is considerable more desirable and more thoroughly/attentively preformed than the work of big companies who are contracting forcing cone jobs for large conglomerates such as Browning with the purchase of new fire arms. It’s a custom and careful enhancement, which combined with the porting.. makes this 12 gauge feel and handle nothing short of amazing. Mr. White generally has a one year waiting list due to great demand by competition shooters for his expert and unique forcing cone treatments; mostly sought out by to perazzi owners, and other competition clay busters of all kinds, from all over the country.   I also had the pleasure of having Mr. White do me a custom adjustable comb in the walnut stock while the rifle was in his shop for service.  It's a good combo, and I’m letting it go for a great price, but you'll have to meet me in person in Alamosa Colorado to purchase the weapon, we can meet at Walmart to do the transaction. I am unable to drive long distances currently due to medical restrictions; so, if you’re interested please understand that I can't travel to meet you. I myself am a retired 20-year Gun Smith, and retired US Army LTC. and can guarantee the value in this offer if you're willing to make the trip to pick it up. The rifle has very little wear (a minor scratch on the foregrip is all), and overall has been fired less than 1000 times, so is in excellent condition. I just don’t get out as much as I used to..  I find my eyesight slipping alongside the other joys of old age.. anyways... let’s talk. thanks for your time,  James Maxwell You may call me @ REDACTED - (please leave a message if I don't answer, leave a name and contact number, and I’ll get right back to you, thanks again.)"

These KS-47s are basically an AR platform that is chambered in 7.62x39, and accepts any AK magazine. Way cheaper to shoot than firing 5.56 or 223, plus much more punch! If you're unfamiliar with these rifles, check out the video on youtube (PSA KS47 -vs- CMMG Mutant).The Palmetto State Armory KS47 is based on the AR15, and combines the modular construction, accuracy and precision of the AR platform with the stopping power and the magazine options of the AK. While the current AR47 fires the 7.62x39 AK round, it uses modified AR-style magazines that are not nearly as plentiful as AK-style magazines, that were optimized for reliable feeding of the 7.62x39 round. The KS47 lets the AK shooter capitalize on his inventory of magazines and ammo with an AR-style platform. Unlike the AK, where the barrel is permanently pressed into the receiver, the KS47 features an AR-style modular configuration which consists of a barreled upper receiver, and a lower receiver that houses the fire control group and magazine. The modular configuration allows customers to have several different barrel configurations with one lower receiver, just by releasing two pins. Lower: The 7075-T6 billet lower receiver is hardcoat anodized, and accepts standard AR15 fire control groups. The extended magazine release is outside of the trigger guard for safety, which allows for an AK-style release movement, but also features oversize side paddles for fingertip release by the trigger finger. Fitted with a Ergo grip and M4-style stock, the receiver also features a standard, mil-spec diameter, 6 position, 7075 carbine buffer tube. The KS47 lower has steel reinforcements to accept AK style surplus magazines including drum-style.Upper: The KS47 hybrid upper receiver is precision machined out of billet 7075 T6 aluminum, and then hardcoat anodized for durability. While retaining the look of a standard M4 upper, the KS47 hybrid upper is designed to work with either the KS47 lower, or the standard AR47 lower. The chrome moly vanadium barrel is chambered in 7.62x39 with a 1 in 10 twist, has M4-style feed ramps, is nitride treated for accuracy and durability, and is finished off with a 5/8-24 thread A2-style compensator. The forward, assist, dust cover, charging handle, and safety are all standard AR15, as is the PSA Slim Keymod free-float rail and barrel nut.BCG: The hybrid KS47 Bolt carrier group works with either AK47 magazines or AR47 magazines, and features an extended firing pin. The carrier is made of 8620 steel, chrome lined and phosphate coated, and the chrome lined gas key is attached with grade 8 bolts and properly staked. The Bolt is made of phosphate coated 9310 steel. The KS47 Upper and Hybrid BCG are compatible with standard AR15 lowers for use with AR47-style magazines.I'm asking $900 for the rifle with one steel or PMAG 30 round magazine (buyers choice). *** Drum magazine in pics is not include with this sell.Private Party DetailsRegistered on 12/30/2013Listings by this userLOCATION: Raeford, Fort Bragg, Fayetteville, North CarolinaSHIPPING:NoCATEGORYRiflesMANUFACTURER Palmetto State ArmoryCALIBER 7.62x39ACTION Semi-automaticFIREARM TYPE Rifle"

This One of a kind Browning Citori 12 Gauge has the gold engraving on its receiver indicating: ""Special Sporting Clays Edition"", and features 32"" magnaported barrels, Walnut furniture, 2 custom chokes (installed) blued finish, Gold trigger, and comes with a nice storage and transport case. The most special attraction on this Jewel however is that it features custom professionally lengthened forcing cones done by highly respected/old fashioned method - Master Gunsmith Jerry White, from Fort Collins Colorado; who's one of only a handful of Smiths in the country who's been lengthening forcing cones for over 50 years. This treatment is considerable more desirable and more thoroughly/attentively preformed than the work of big companies who are contracting forcing cone jobs for large conglomerates such as Browning with the purchase of new fire arms. It’s a custom and careful enhancement, which combined with the porting..
makes this 12 gauge feel and handle nothing short of amazing. Mr. White generally has a one year waiting list due to great demand by competition shooters for his expert and unique forcing cone treatments; mostly sought out by to perazzi owners, and other competition clay busters of all kinds, from all over the country.   I also had the pleasure of having Mr. White do me a custom adjustable comb in the walnut stock while the rifle was in his shop for service.  It's a good combo, and I’m letting it go for a great price, but you'll have to meet me in person in Alamosa Colorado to purchase the weapon, we can meet at Walmart to do the transaction. I am unable to drive long distances currently due to medical restrictions; so, if you’re interested please understand that I can't travel to meet you. I myself am a retired 20-year Gun Smith, and retired US Army LTC. and can guarantee the value in this offer if you're willing to make the trip to pick it up. The rifle has very little wear (a minor scratch on the foregrip is all), and overall has been fired less than 1000 times, so is in excellent condition. I just don’t get out as much as I used to..  I find my eyesight slipping alongside the other joys of old age.. anyways... let’s talk. thanks for your time,  James Maxwell You may call me @ REDACTED - (please leave a message if I don't answer, leave a name and contact number, and I’ll get right back to you, thanks again.)"

Each rifle has exactly 20 rounds through. Both were sent back to Springfield's custom shop and reworked(have the paperwork to prove it). Absolutely mint condition, you're not going to find a cleaner ""used"" rifle. 1. Springfield Saint AR15. 16"", 1/8 barrel, all BCM furniture, really nice rifle. Trigger is excellent after having gone back to the factory, the 20 rounds I put through it were inside 1-1.5"" at 100 with iron sights. All original paperwork, hard case, one magazine, Springfield BUIS. 2. Springfield Socom 16 M1A. This is a beast of a rifle. 16"" barrel on a semi auto .308 platform gives you all the advantages of the .308 Win cartridge in a rifle that isn't four feet long. Trigger was redone by Springfield and is on par with a NM rifle. No creep, breaks like glass, almost no overtravel. Haven't really shot it for groups, but all 20 rounds I fired hit a 9"" target at 100 shooting offhand. Zombie slayer or deer rifle, this will get it done. All paperwork, factory box, one magazine. I paid $3000 OTD at Shorty's in West Allis for the pair, never fired them, and then had them sent off for a custom tune up(I know a guy).

Brand new, never used. The Improved BedNet System (IBNS) was designed to fit securely onto a military cot with push-andlock straps on all four corners. The IBNS can also be used in the field thanks to its strong, waterproof tub floor. Its instant deployment, waterproof floor, and four corner buckles make the IBNS an efficient, fast-access shelter to protect soldiers from insects while asleep or resting on a cot OR in the field. In addition, the IBNS is designed to be upgradable to our EBNS using a single pole and fly. This givesyou protection from the elements in addition to the IBNS's unsurpassed protection from insects. The IBNS is constructed of 70 Denier 1.9 ounce ripstop nylon and fine mesh. It is EPA registered and has Permethrin bonded to the material for insect repellency. It is supported by a strong and ultra-light .134 diameter pultruded fiberglass rod which winds around the shelter, expanding it to its given shape. When the rolled up IBNS's cinch strap is removed, the shelter is released and snaps into shape automatically; no assembly or set-up is required. A carry bag is included. The coiled, stored size of the shelter is 13"" x 13"" x 3"". Since they pack so small they are perfect for ""bug out"" or disaster bags. CPAI-84 Fire Retardant rated.
