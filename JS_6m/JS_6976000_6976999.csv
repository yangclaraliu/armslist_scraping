There is no original box. Bought this Glock from Academy and found out later the extractor was missing (I had Academy replace it). I suspect original owner removed it by mistake and forgot or did not know how to install it before He sold it to Academy, therefore it never was used much. This GlocK has no signs of use at all. It has night sights, extended magazine release, Talon grips, extended slide release, gap filler and Scherer magazine extension on one of two magazines. I’ve added a NDZ 3.5 pound trigger bar (original is included). This is a great combination for a carry gun that results in about a 4.5 pound smooth trigger pull. Known as the ""BABY GLOCK,"" the GLOCK 26 Gen 3 in 9x19mm has been the most sought-after concealed carry option since its release in 1994-a market once dominated by the 5-round revolver. Especially with the Fiber Carbon IWB holster & Remora magazine holder included. The magazine capacity of 10 rounds is standard, and the highly accurate firing characteristics (almost the same as a full size Glock 17) explain why the G26 is the mainstay backup option among security personnel and agencies worldwide. Interesting that any Glock 9mm magazine can be used including a 33round magazine. I will ship to a FFL dealer. My contact info is 1-REDACTED"

It is very crisp and has an excellent reset. Just about everything in and on this pistol has been changed. Just to list the ones I remember are: MGW three dot sights, commander hammer, beaver tail, extended safety, extended slide release, Magpul polymer grips, Wilson adjustable trigger, Wilson custom fitted barrel bushing, front grip tape, polymer checkered back strap , stainless steel grip screws & steel guide rod. The ejector now ejects the cases straight up & over the operator. Stock ATI pistols have a reputation of ejecting rounds in your face. The slide has been blued & the lower is Painted “Desert Tan” with Brownell Aluma- Hyde. Aluma-Hyde is a very tough epoxy paint finish. The pistol has been test fired only and is new.

One is in caliber .308 (THE .308 HAS BEEN TRADED AWAY, I WILL REDO THE AD WHEN I GET TIME) and the other is .223. Both come in unfinished wood, perfect for those who like to upgrade to aftermarket furniture anyways, wood could also be finished if you desired.  Both are the square back receivers which allows you the option of  countless aftermarket products. Both are unfired, and have been living in my safe unmolested since the Muslim put a ban on their importation. I have the boxes they came in with paperwork and two mags I believe. These are very well made firearms, the receivers are thicker than other Ak's, you do not see these everyday, especially in these calibers. Please make fair and educated offers, both trade and/or cash. Please do not ask ""how much"".  A transfer will have to be done, and I prefer that to be done at East County Guns in Elma, but it is quite possible we could work some other plan out as well. I can ship to a FFL as well. Ignore the ""Saiga"" under the manufacturer tab, Armslist doesn't provide the proper options. NO flakes, noone that can't legally own, also any ridicolous offers will not be responded too."
