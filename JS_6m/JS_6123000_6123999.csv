Ck out the specs on the image tube data card and compare it to others. Unlikely you will find any as good. Despite the card noting resolution of 64lp, it calculates out to 72lp (2167.2 / 30.1 = 72) Can be weapon mounted and rated for up to 7.62 (.308), unlike many of the others out there either not reccomeneded for weapon mounting or limited to 5.56 or less. THIS IS NOT AN AUTOGATED UNIT.   Have extensive pics/video on line; address above. Video/pics include resolution chart, with inside dark and outside before moon illumination scenes. Remember, photo/vid through night vision devices is substantially less sharp than an in person view.

Hooks to any picatinny rail with set screws.The bad: Smooth bore so the rounds tend to spawl after launched. It is a black powder charge (you can do smokless but Ive never tried) so range is only about 250-300 feet. Its not quiet. If you are used to firing an M203 that ""thoop"" sound when you fire it doesnt happen. This is more like a black powder pistol going off. rounds are not cheap. Much better if you load your own which is time consuming. I purchased this at the Berea gun show last February from American Specialty ammo for $350 Nice people but not very informative. Im not parting with any of the rounds I have so please dont ask. Just selling the launcher. Open to REASONABLE offers. No trades"

Comes with IWI cleaning kit and (1) 20 round magazine and (1) 25 round magazine. From the factory:The UZI PRO pistol is a modernized Micro UZI semi-auto pistol based on the world famous UZI sub-machinegun, variations of which have sold in excess of 2,000,000 units worldwide. The new blow-back operated 9mm UZI PRO incorporates advanced polymers in the lower section of the receiver resulting in lighter weight and relocation of the magazine release to a more practical and traditional pistol based location. Unlike earlier UZI models, the charging handle has been moved from the top of the pistol to the left side of the receiver. This allows the addition of a full length Picatinny rail to the top of the pistol, permitting the use of any optical device that utilizes a Picatinny rail clamp mount. An additional Picatinny rail is incorporated in the polymer lower that allows the use of lights and/or lasers to be mounted directly under the barrel. Extremely reliable and accurate, the UZI PRO pistol incorporates three safety mechanisms: Manual thumb safety, Grip safety that must be fully depressed before cocking or firing Firing pin block. Each UZI PRO pistol is supplied with two magazines, one 20 round and one 25 round in states that permit these magazine capacities."

Overall this rifle features many correct Remington parts on an original barreled Remington 1903 with dark parkerization. The barrel gauges new with a ME of 1 and TE ~2 with CMP gauges. Rear Sight which smoothly adjusts with out sloppiness or play. I purchased these rifles for use in Springfield Matches and shooting and first and foremost wanted a good shooter with a new barrel and tight adjustable rear sights. Most CMP1903's I had inspected had been Greek refinished dark blue and featured well worn barrels with muzzle wear of 2-3+. The VFW returns I inspected were with a few exceptions more ""correct"" as issued with barrels fired with black powder blanks and pitted and dark bore barrels. Converted drill rifles came later and were considered unsuitable for reconversion to firing use. I have removed the grease preservative from the wood and metal, a many houred labor. Otherwise the rifle is how I purchased it from the CMP. I have found these 1903 rifles to be the most accurate of the US military issued rifles, including the M1 Garand, M14, and M16, only a 1917 with new bore will equal it in slow fire accuracy. With the barrel condition on this rifle it is unlikely to ever be worn out through shooting."

This is a brand new custom built AR15 in the 450 Bushmaster caliber.  Total weight is a very light 6 lbs. 5 oz.    The upper is a Franklin Armory 7075-T6 aluminum forging made specifically for large caliber AR-15s like the Bushmaster 450 cartridge.  The upper features a factory oversized ejection port, factory installed dust cover, and forward assist.  The lower is a matching Franklin Armory 7075-T6 aluminum forging marked Multi Caliber.  The lower contains a tensioning screw that can be used to remove all clearance between the upper and lower creating a wobble free assembly.  The adjustable carbine stock, trigger guard, and grip are Magpul MOE in flat dark earth.  The Magpul stock can be adjusted to 6 different positions. The Magpul MOE grip has a storage compartment.  The lower parts kit is Milspec.  The aluminum free float hand guard is a 12” long key mod rail system in flat dark earth. The top of the rail is full length picatinny with 2 additional 3” long FDE key mod rails that can be attached anywhere along the sides or bottom of the hand guard.  The ported barrel is manufactured by custom barrel manufacturer Deadshot Barrels.  This 16” barrel is of the heavy contour style and is manufactured from 4140 Chrome Moly steel with a non-reflective armor black Cerakote coating.  The barrel is ported and therefore does not require a flash hider or muzzle brake.  The ports act as a muzzle brake which keeps the recoil down and since it is integrated into the barrel the overall length is kept to a minimum.  The barrel features a center feed ramp for proper feeding of the Bushmaster 450 cartridge.  The barrel is manufactured for a carbine length gas system with a .875” diameter gas block seat.  The underside of the barrel is dimpled for proper gas block alignment.  Rifle comes with one stainless steel 5 shot magazine.  Awesome looking and handling rifle.  Nothing to do but mount some optics and start shooting.  Rifle has been function fired to ensure proper function.
Payment: If local cash only.  Must have an active drivers license and sign a bill of sale.
If shipping is required I will ship to a licensed FFL holder of your choosing for $40 which includes insurance.  Payment can be in the form of USPS money order or cashier’s check.

It is best for applications where maximum suppression is key.The ULTRA 9 will suppress a typical .308 bolt-action rifle down to approx 132-134 dB1. The ULTRA 9 will suppress a typical .300 Blackout bolt-action rifle to about 118-120 dB shooting subsonic ammunition. The ULTRA 9 weighs just 11.9 ounces.ULTRA SERIESThe ULTRA series represents a revolutionary improvement in titanium precision rifle suppressors. We took everything we’ve learned over the last half decade building the best precision rifle suppressors in the world and put it into the ULTRA design. The ULTRA series offers unprecedented light weight and class-leading suppression levels.Compared to the prior 30P-1/30CB9 series, the ULTRA series is 25-30% lighter, 4-5 dB quieter, and much stronger. The ULTRA series holds the same precision and repeatability as the 30P-1/30CB series.The .30 caliber ULTRA series includes three suppressors: 9-inch, 7-inch, and 5-inch versions are available. They are available in either our Compact Brake (CB) “Thread Over Muzzle Brake” (TOMB) mount or in a direct thread mount. The CB mount and direct thread mount have equivalent accuracy and repeatability.With the CB mount, the suppressor mates to a conical shoulder on the brake and locks up rock solid and extremely tight. In direct thread configuration, the ULTRA suppressors use a heat-treated 17-4 thread insert and initial blast shield. The .30 caliber ULTRA series suppressors also have the flexibility to be changed from direct thread to CB mount and vice versa via a simple factory service operation, in case your needs change. This is accomplished by removing or replacing the default brake from the direct thread version.The ULTRA series is constructed of titanium with a fully-welded core. This material and construction"
