This is an original Armalite (not an Eagle Arms made in the Armalite factory) with 3 30 round factory steel magazines, 1 30 round Pmag, and a fresh 420 round can of Federal 5.56 NATO 62gr. steel core green tips. This model has a true H-bar 5.56 NATO chambered barrel, with a mid-length gas operating system. Came from the factory with a heavy buffer and mil-spec bolt carrier group. A few modifications have been made which include: 
- A.R.M.S. #41B front gas block A2 style folding front sight. This is, in my opinion, the best folding sight on the market. They do not wobble when in up position and truly do retain a great zero.
- Diamondhead rear folding sight. Makes centering on target a breeze!
- Troy mid-length Delta battle rail with two extra rail sections installed.
- Mag-Pul UBR adjustable stock. Rock solid, provides a solid cheek weld (and doesn't pinch your beard, for you guys that know what I mean)
- Mag-Pul AFG2 vertical grip
- Ergo Grip 
- Anti-tip followers were added to the magazines.

The metal fit and finish are markedly better than most production guns today. All external metal parts are highly polished and hot-salt blued, yielding a beautiful, deep black, gloss finish. The wood-to-metal fit is very good; the wood is slightly proud, as it should be in a new gun to allow for future refinishing and shrinkage. Drilled and tapped for tang sight… The American black walnut stock is lightly oiled; this will allow the wood to take on age patina with use. Alternatively, the owner can occasionally rub in a little stock oil to keep the stock looking fresh and to cover scratches. Beautiful Brush Gun… - MODEL:1873 Carbine, I Will SHIP the Rifle for $30"

Slightly used; only been to the range once.  This KSG has an extended mag selector switch and an upgraded forend grip, both from SMT tactical.  This is serious fire power. From the factory: The KSG is our first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape and design are similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gage 3"" shells each, for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4"" shells). The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine."

The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gage 3"" shells each, for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4"" shells). The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine."
