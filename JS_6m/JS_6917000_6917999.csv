It was made at BRNO for Czech military use, and it is NOT a Romanian contract rifle.

Gun is in 85 percent condition with both sling loops on both sides for a total of 4. Fires 8mm accurately- I was able to squeeze a 5 MOA group at 100 yards, impressive for an old war horse with open sights. Feel free to respond to this post with your offers.

The Beretta 92A1 was designed for the Marine Corp and has substantially beefier slide and frame with an internal shock buffer to reduce wear and increase the life of the pistol. The pistol also has a picatinny rail and dovetailed sights. The barrel is chrome lined. The pistol was manufactured in Italy and commands a hefty price tag (see receipt)because of all the improvements. This pistol is contructed to improve accuracy and you can see by the target it is one hole at 7 yards (combat fighting distance). It also comes with (3) PVD coated magazines that are impervious to corrosion and sand resistant and new Beretta walnut grips. Included is the hard case, manual and all associated paperwork. If you want to save a bunch of money, purchase this almost brand new pistol. This is an awesome deal for the seasoned shooter or a beginner shooter as it is a very soft shooting pistol. I have $820.00 invested in it and will be selling the pistol for a highly discounted price."

I am thinning my collection and have several listed so please take a look at my other pistols on armslist. Thank you for your time and have a good day. I do have other hard to find guns that are not listed. For example I have many colt guns such as hard to find EL CEN series 1911 38 super, Detective Specials, Snake guns such as unfired enhanced drilled tapped 4 inch Colt King Cobra , unfired 4 inch drilled tapped Colt Anaconda (extremely rare year of 2000) , stainless 4 inch Python (shot 6 times), 6 and 4 inch nicel Python.Hard to find Smith and Wesson guns such as 625-2 (model of 1988 which is believed to only have had 1500 made, all original), Pre-lock Lady Smith revolver, pre-lock 29-3 combat, chiefs special cs-9 like new, and an engraved unfired Smith model 29-10.Have several 1911 guns in brands such as Rock Island, Ruger, Springfield including Loader Operator MC and TRP Operator, Para Ordinance 14 45 limited stainless double stack with 4 mags, early Kimber combat carry with laser gripsAlso have a Walther PPK (Interarms Richmond VA the rarer one) basically like new and a Walther ppk/s with crimson trace laser and box, (smith and wesson) I may accept trades toward other guns and/ or ammo if at a really good deal. Trades would need to be in my favor or something rare that I am looking for. Multiple gun trades are welcome. I prefer pistols though.If you live out of state, purchase will have to be through squaretrade or venmo to protect us both. If you have to send payment any other way, it has to go through gunbroker. We will have to do the transfer through an ffl and you will be responsible for the transfer. All state laws will be followed."

I purchased it new for a rifle less than a year ago and just never got around to shooting much of it. It has been in a climate and moisture controlled environment. I originally paid a little over 1$ per round as this ammo is kinda pricey. You definitely get what you pay for though! I'm mainly looking to sell it however may be willing to accept trades on 7.62 or 5.45 steel case russian ammo, or American Eagle 5.56 55gr, AK mags (not magpul, pro mag, or tapco). If you do a cash price I will be willing to do a price per round thing based on exactly how many rounds I have. I'm looking at around .95 cents per round.  Midway USA currently has it for 1.13$ per round + roughly 10 dollars for shipping on the order. I also have for sale an Inforce Hayley Strategic WML and Mossberg 590 Marine Magnum (1990's model so it isnt the new junk, 20"" 8 round tube) Contact me if you are interested in any of these things.
