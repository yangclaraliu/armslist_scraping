If you have something I am interested in, we can make the trade and I will pay her cash.  If you send me an email asking how much I want for it, you will get no response because I am looking for best offer (again cash or trade).  Trade offers I would be interested in would be Colt/Smith & Wesson revolvers, sig sauer semi-autos and no long guns.  Thanks for checking out the ad and let me know if you are interested.I was told that this gun was new because when he purchased it many moons ago, he put it up and his wife said she knows for certain he never fired it once.  I just don't know if it was fired before him because I do not know where he got it.  If it was fired before, then the previous owner was meticulous in cleaning it up because it is very nice.  So shoot me an offer.UPDATE:  I pulled this post because I had an overwhelmingly amount of email responses to respond to (115) but I am putting it back out because I am getting even more asking if it is still for sale.  So I guess I will just manage.  If it is pulled again, consider it sold!"

There is some pitting in the nickel steel receiver, this is common in old 95's. The rust blued barrel retains most of the bluing, no rust, and has a great bore. This old repeater has the famous Climbing Lyman rear sight, probably from the factory, this was a common option on these long range repeaters. The rear dovetail has a filler plug that looks like it's always has been there. Teddy Roosevelt's favorite rifle was a 1895 Winchester he named Big Medicne. The 30-03 was the U.S. Military's official caliber for a very short time. A guy named Spitizer designed a pointed full metal jacket bullet to replace the big, round bullet designed for the 03 Springfield ergo the 30-06 we all know and love. Most of the 30-03's went to the Mexicans fighting their Revolution. (we had a bunch of surplus ammo). this rifle fires 30-06 ammo through it's shiny bore like a champ. I have had this fine piece of history a long time. The stock has some dents, it appears that it rode in a rifle rack a good bit. The wood has no cracks, it's a rock solid rifle. I can send a lot of photos. It even has some black ebony or buffalo horn in it's forearm. It is all original. I saw one like this in rough shape for sale with a price of $3000.00. I would feel guilty and sleep poorly if I received that much. I will take $1800 though, it is worth much more.

ONLY the upper is for sale here, so no FFL needed and I can ship.My work is forcing me to use their issued Colt upper, so this upper I had built is redundant for me. No expense was spared and this is a GREAT upper. It has an HBAR marked barrel for maryland compliance; it's stamped ""H-BAR"" right on top so you never need to worry. It started as a complete Aero Precision upper (finest in the industry, used by the premium brands), and then the armorer replaced select parts to make it, in his words, ""an unstoppable duty rifle"". Accuracy is incredible with a FN HBAR barrel and free floating handguard. The heavy barrel is compensated for by the lightweight upper and handguard; total weight of the rifle on my issue lower is only 6lb 13oz, unloaded. This upper is brand new and was test-fired with a single 30 round mag dump on a full-auto lower. All rounds ejected perfectly at 4:00. Bolt locked open on empty mag. This upper is fantastic and no expense was spared, you really can't get any better. There's nothing to improve on, this upper is ready for duty, plus it's HBAR marked for guaranteed compliance. I'm asking what I paid because guaranteed maryland-legal uppers are rare.

Rare and Desirable Model of Colt’s Horse Pistol
 
Here we present an antique, much sought after Colt Second Model Dragoon Revolver. This pistol was designed for use by horse-mounted rifleman, and it is so much pistol that you will want a horse to carry it for you. This pistol weighs in at over 4 pounds.
 
The Second Model was first offered in 1850 and continued production through 1851, for a total of only 2,700, the rarest of Colt’s models of Dragoons. Colt’s Dragoons experienced some of the harshest conditions the mid-19th century had to offer, and it is amazing that any survived, especially in this condition.
 
This specimen is in fantastic condition, as cleaned. The one piece, walnut grips have been refinished and still preserve the inspector cartouche “WAT” for Capt. William Anderson Thornton. The frame also bears the “U.S.” under the “Colt’s Patent” marking. The cylinder shows the entirety of the Texas Ranger Indian Battle scene, with only small detail lost to age and cleaning. It is still quite clear. The action is excellent. All serial numbers match. This is a great addition for any collection.
 
Own the original! This is a legitimate antique and not a reproduction. Compare to other 2nd Model Dragoons available for up to $55,000 or more!
 
Barrel is 7.5 inches in length.
 
Caliber: .44 percussion
 
Bore is in very good condition and the firearm is in working order.
 
Overall condition as seen in photos.
 
Here is a fantastic 2nd Model Dragoon to be the crown jewel of your collection."

This is a great pistol--extremely acurate to the point of being boring almost. It's a nickel version, and the finish is a bit wonky in a couple spots. I installed a new fiber-optic front sight on the pistol and now it's accurate and easy to get on target. The original front sight was black so it disappeared from time to time depending on the target. The trigger is amazing on this too, way better than any other pistol I've ever had. It comes with everything in the pictures: original box and manual, 2 10 round magazines, holster with Browning logo that has a slot for the additional magazine (this is really nice for in the field--I used it squirrel hunting and could go all day on just the two mags).Nothing wrong with the gun.  I bought it for my son and I to shoot together, but he's not too interested anymore, so I'm selling it to fund some other projects I'm working on.
