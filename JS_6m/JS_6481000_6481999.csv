These are steel casings, brass polished, steel tip, 147 grains (I think). It's getting hard to find these online anymore, when they are used up they will never be found again. I am firm on $160 but have about 10 of these I can part with, if you buy 2 or more cans I will include an original can opener for free.  At $160 that is just $.36 per round. I will usually ship to most people but only if you want 2 cans or more.  The shipping charge per 2 cans is typically $50.    Lower 48 states only.  Thanks for looking."

The release-2 version of the original LCP also has better sights and a new, vastly improved trigger which has a much shorter and lighter trigger pull than the original version of the LCP. This sale includes a nice ankle holster for deep concealment and a Kydex OWB holster, factory lock with two keys, three 6-round mags supplied by Ruger with pinky extension baseplates installed (also with flat floorplates in the box), factory box and all paperwork that came from the factory (as shown in photo). On this model which came with three magazines, Ruger also threw in a small plastic hard case allowing travel with the gun and one magazine.  The hard case is included as well.I prefer a face-to-face transfer in east Texas without shipping. Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with a valid TX driver’s license or permit. I’m in College Station so anyplace in the DFW, Austin, Houston triangle is OK.  Maybe we could split the driving distance to help each other out.If the ad is still up, the gun is still available."

What you are viewing is a Remington 870 12 GA magnum Police model (see what that means below)that has been converted to a Bullpup. The auction includes all parts to reconvert it to original condition. The 870 is parkerized with a 20"" barrel, has no rust and shoots great. It is a magnum so it will take 3"" loads. I have added a magazine extension, flashlight with rad laser, Iron Daniel Defense sights and a sling. The Bullpup kit is from Bullpup international and when installed works like a dream. No racking issues, no jams just a smooth operating tactical weapon.
Here is list of differences between Remington 870 Express and Remington 870 Police. Most of the parts which are used on Remington 870 Police are easy to get and install on the Express version of a shotgun.
870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection.
All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift.
All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality.
Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function.
A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs.
A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds.
Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.
The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks.
The Police shotguns utilize the heavy duty SPEEDFEED Stocks and Fore-ends.
The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty.
The Express model has a BEAD BLAST BLUE finish while the Police models utilize either High Luster bluing or Parkerization.
The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing.
The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a “ball detent” system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade “synthetic magazine spring retainer” lock down as used on the Express system.
The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization or bluing.
Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express models.Shipping will be done through an FFL dealer."

This was one of 263 ever produced in 2007-2008. I will NOT be including the sling or the scope. I will ship in the original box. Here is a quote from Jason Cloessner on the Lipsey's website... The K1A 6.5X55mm was the third installment of the K1A Series. The Ruger Number 1 was way overdue in this classic caliber. For those who love the 6.5's, it really doesn't need much of an explanation as to why. This model was the fastest selling and is still today the one we get the most calls for. Most of the rifles produced were shipped in 2007 and a few came in early 2008. If you are one of the few people lucky enough to have one of these, you really have a gem of a rifle. The feedback I have received from those who own them has been very positive towards the accuracy of these rifles. With the 1-in-8"" twist, you can take advantage of those long high sectional density bullets that the 6.5X55mm is known for. WILLING TO SHIP,"
