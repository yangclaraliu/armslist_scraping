The firearm works great, never had any issues, has been well maintained. Standard AR pistol grip, low profile stock, standard 6.8 BCG and charging handle. The complete upper itself cost me 550 without any other parts.

I have 3 boxes of 20 rounds, 2 S&B soft tip boxes for hunting, and 1 standard federal 20 round box as range ammo I will throw in for an extra 30$.If you have any questions feel free to contact me via email."

Keep in mind that the Standard M1A is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A a great shooter.

This pistol utilizes a long stroke rotating barrel locked breech recoil system with dual extractors for its robustness and reliability. Boberg machines their barrels with precision tolerances allowing for equivalent and sometimes superior ballistics to common full size semi auto .45acp pistols. The locked breech rotating barrel recoil system allowed Boberg to employ a recoil buffer and slow cycle speed down by 1/3 of traditional semi autos providing substantial recoil reduction and control of the pistol. The feature that stands out above the rest is the ammunition feed system which utilizes a pull push system that pulls the round out of the magazine from the back and then pushes the round forward to chamber. The design is fascinating and fun to manipulate. Look for our two other Boberg models in the coming days. The pistols will ship with their factory box, two magazines each and documentation. There is one notable difference in the factory configuration of these pistols: one is outfitted with Tritium night sights and the other has white three dot fixed sights. Thanks for looking!"
