The slide recoils with every shot to pick up the new round, it can be disassembled by taking the slide off and it's all steel. Making it feel almost identical to the real thing.The gun itself was around $100 when I bought it and the extra mag was $30-$40.

The Katana has some light surface rust near the tip of the sword from when someone handled it and put it back in sheath without me knowing. I would like $500 cash OBO for the set. I can even throw in the training Bokken if interested. Serious trades would be considered, but I prefer cash. Cheers!"
