I am not the original owner and do not know for sure the grain.  I believe it is 149 grain which is the original US Military Lake City XM80 projectiles firing at 2700 fps. If so this is identical to the ammo issued to the US military.  Regardless I don't think it is less than 149 grain and could be as high as 175 grain.  I have this PRICED to sell so it is priced at the lower bulk price of $0.70 and there is no shipping."

An outstanding representative of this iconic weapon, this rifle was in service in time to have played a part in WWI, and having remained in service until after the Korean conflict(denoted by the Nitro-Proving marks on the barrel), it undoubtedly saw combat in WWII, and possibly Korea. An outstanding, sturdy service rifle, the Lee-Enfield gave the British soldier of the early 20th century, an almost unmatched advantage in terms of sheer volume of firepower. Having the smoothest bolt action ever designed, the Lee-Enfield often gave the enemy the impression that the Tommies of WWI were armed with automatic rifles. Often seen in well-used condition, this rifle is in stark contrast to those normally encountered by the collector. Non-import marked, it would be an excellent acquisition, worthy of the advanced Enfield collection.Condition:Is near excellent-the rifle shows no sign of post-service refinish, and arsenal bluing is better than 90% having only mild fading and high edge wear. Metal surfaces are void of pitting and rust, and all markings are well-struck, legible and correct. Matching serialized components include the receiver, barrel, bolt handle and nose cap/bayonet lug, with the rear sight being a service replacement, the furniture unnumbered, and the magazine having a different number. As stated, no import mark was found. Mechanically flawless, the action is properly fluid and smooth, while the bore is near excellent with strong, well-defined rifling and no rust or pitting."

An outstanding representative of this iconic weapon, this rifle was in service in time to have played a part in WWI, and having remained in service until after the Korean conflict(denoted by the Nitro-Proving marks on the barrel), it undoubtedly saw combat in WWII, and possibly Korea. An outstanding, sturdy service rifle, the Lee-Enfield gave the British soldier of the early 20th century, an almost unmatched advantage in terms of sheer volume of firepower. Having the smoothest bolt action ever designed, the Lee-Enfield often gave the enemy the impression that the Tommies of WWI were armed with automatic rifles. Often seen in well-used condition, this rifle is in stark contrast to those normally encountered by the collector. Non-import marked, it would be an excellent acquisition, worthy of the advanced Enfield collection.Condition:Is near excellent-the rifle shows no sign of post-service refinish, and arsenal bluing is better than 90% having only mild fading and high edge wear. Metal surfaces are void of pitting and rust, and all markings are well-struck, legible and correct. Matching serialized components include the receiver, barrel, bolt handle and nose cap/bayonet lug, with the rear sight being a service replacement, the furniture unnumbered, and the magazine having a different number. As stated, no import mark was found. Mechanically flawless, the action is properly fluid and smooth, while the bore is near excellent with strong, well-defined rifling and no rust or pitting."

The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.   Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports.

SERIOUS OFFERS ONLY! NO TRADES! I CAN SHIP IF NEEDED.Springfield Armory® was the first 1911 manufacturer to offer a frame that included an accessory rail as part of the forging. The Champion™ Operator® mates this forged Operator® frame with a shorter slide and a 4 inch barrel. This results in a pistol that is suitable for concealed carry or operating where a light is needed – and it doesn’t sacrifice any capacity.Pick up a Champion™ Operator®, and you’ll find that it’s a feature-loaded expression of the classic 4 inch 1911. The beavertail grip safety, flat mainspring housing, Lightweight Delta™ hammer, extended ambidextrous thumb safeties and extended trigger give you all the ergonomic advantages you want in a carry pistol. The 3-Dot tritium combat sights mean that the Champion™ Operator® is ready for any conditions. A carry gun also has to be reliable. Thanks to the lowered and flared ejection port, fully supported ramped match grade barrel and proprietary dual-captive recoil system, the Champion™ Operator® is guaranteed to perform when you need it most. And the Armory Kote™ finish will keep it performing for years to come.You can carry the Champion™ Operator® with you all day, appreciating its smaller size and standard capacity. Then slide your favorite tactical light on the rail, and put it on your nightstand.

This rifle started as a Remington 700, and now is a custom built F Class Precision rifle. It is built left handed so that a right handed shooter can manipulate the action without removing their dominant hand from the grip and trigger. This action was chambered, blueprinted, and threaded by Arnold Dew: Larry Vickers personal gunsmith with over 20 years experience. Ask anyone who the best gunsmith around is, and no fail his name will be given.I will attempt to list all the parts, but I know I will miss something:Douglas Barrels Air Gauged Chromoly 30in bull barrel. 1.5in at the receiver, 1.25 at the muzzle with AD Customs indexed BrakeMDT Tac 21 Chassis with 20 MOA top railXLR Industries Heavy Duty butt stock drilled for MonoPod1911 style pistol grip (which accepts any custom 1911 scales)GG&G Extreme Duty BipodTimney Calvin Elite .8-1.5lb triggerBurris PEPR scope mountNikon Monarch 8-32x50ED M BDC2 x Accuracy International 5 Round MagsThis rifle shows very light wear as I have only put about 100rnds through the bore, and she has always been transported in a Pelican Case. From the beginning, I've easily had Sub 1/4 MOA at 100yds. Only time it's been outside that was because of shooter error. She has less recoil then an AR, and I have videos to prove it.  I have well over $5000 invested in this gun.  I am taking offers for cash, and will CONSIDER offers of cash and partial trade for your AR in .308, 5.56 or .223 Wylde.
