This pistol also is equipped with Tru dot night sights with the ledge for easy manipulation the pistol is overall the best concealed carry combat weapon I have handled or purchased on the market and I am a firm believer in Hammer fired pistols and this particular pistol has a steady light Lem double-action trigger that feels very much like a single action trigger and the reason I think a lot of people love this particular set up is because this pistol has a steady and safe trigger system without a safety it's a longer take up but a very quick one when you pull your finger back with intention to shoot if you want to you can stop at the break or you can go with a crisp shot giving you the opportunity to actually time your shot this particular pistol is amazing and the concept behind it is nothing short of it. This is your opportunity to get this pistol with every option out of the box in mint condition $575 cash money and it is yours this is a low price for this pistol and is well worth every penny!

I actually have another one of these set ups on another 40sw PC n also have the larger equinox digital scopes with features such as zoom, video out etc. on yet another but the bigger digital scopes are heavier and not as simple to use. ""Less is best, under stress"" I've found.The field of view of this scope is the same as the bigger scopes if it's married to the same red dot optic because you need to remember that this type scope itself does not have a reticle.Also have an ATN Warrior, true analog from 15 years ago and I prefer it over the digital as a designated rifle mounted scope with retical. May be selling that too.    I'm a livestock farmer and I love this set up as it was my primary fox and coyote gun (my mini yoat smoker) and the only reason I'm selling is because I recently upgraded everything.  If you would like to buy just the Scope and Red dot and laser combination on that rail I will sell that all for $450 (firm) alone and you can clamp that right onto your favorite guns rail and zero it in.The gun is not for sale without the optics package I just as soon keep it because it's a great gun without any scope.I have other pictures available they only allow three here, text me or give me a call and I can send them to you if you're interested but please serious inquiries only.Be sure to look at my other listings cause I have other Gunns I'm looking to trade and have several night guns listed, mostly interested in a trade.ALL MD laws apply.

Micro slides are made to the tightest allowable tolerances, with barrels machined from stainless steel for superior resistance to moisture. All Micro frames are shaped from the finest aluminum for integrity and strength. In many respects a miniature 1911, among the most important Micro design advantages is a single action trigger with the kind of short, smooth pull that ensures accuracy and builds confidence. The thumb safety, slide release and magazine release are pure 1911 as well. Standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Sights are steel – not plastic – and mounted in machined dovetails for additional integrity. Each Micro includes a flush-fitting 6-round magazine and an extended 7-round magazine is available as an accessory.
 
Ideal for shooters with small hands as well as those who insist on mild recoil combined with enough power for concealed carry or home protection, Micro pistols are the right choice for many applications. Best of all, they offer unequaled Kimber quality, dependability and performance.
