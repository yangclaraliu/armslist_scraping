This is a beautiful 1998 ""born on"" date Marlin MR-7 chambered in 30-06. In almost like new condition with absolutely no flaws, it has a beautiful walnut checkered stock inlaid with the Marlin bullseye, 22"" fully floated, crowned and recessed JM stamped barrel, almost flawless bluing, and a stunning jeweled bolt that was masterfully reworked by Skip Baldwin in Michigan. It is topped with a matching set of Leupold rings and bases and an awesome period correct Swift Model 656 3-9x40 scope. Here is a brief history of the rifle, which is touted as one of the finest and most accurate bolt rifles to ever be produced:The Marlin MR-7 was only made from 1996-1999. It was only chambered in .25-06, .270, .280, and .30-06. It features a 3-position safety, a bolt face encircled by three rings of 4140 steel, a shrouded striker and high-visibility cocking indicator. It has an adjustable 3-6 lb trigger, a forged, machined and heat-treated receiver and an extra-strong bolt lockup. The MR-7 has a hinged floorplate with a removable yet securely mounted 4-shot box magazine (The MR-7B does not). It has a 22"" barrel with 6-groove precision rifling and a recessed muzzle. It also has a classically configured, cut-checkered American walnut stock. The later (1999) MR-7B was made with birch wood for the stock and the MR-7B didn't use a floorplate. It was a few $ cheaper and in 1999 the MR-7B was only available in .270 and .30-06 calibers.The Ring of steel around the cartridge and the strong locking lug bolt-face was mimicked off of the Remington 700.The wing-style safety was mimicked from the Winchester Model 70.The ""Dogleg"" Bolt handle mimicked the Ruger M77The floorplate with the detachable mag was mimicked from the Browning A-Bolt.This would be a special setup for someone's collection or a superb and accurate hunting setup. Also included in the deal is an extra factory box mag which is almost impossible to find available. Asking $700 sale/$750 trade, and I'll consider any nice firearm offers, especially a nice factory built AR or big bore wheelgun. Thanks for looking!"

For sale is a M1903 Springfield rifle, barrel date 7-18, and a serial number above 800,000 with sweeping bolt in .30-06. Yes, that means this is one of the ""safe shooters"" so highly sought. It has several stock cartooches indicating one, or possibly two rearsenal stints after the war, which is where it recieved the green-gray parkarization common from late 1918 through WW2 (this was very common among service weapons, though I will point out that WW1 Springfields were originally factory-blued when issued) and a new (but still WW1) bolt. The stock, rear sights, and other parts maintain their original WW1 set-up/configuration.This is a solid rifle and a chance to up your WW1 arms collection during the centennary without breaking the bank (if this were still factory-blued/skipped rearsenal it would easily be in the $3000 range). The M1903 leather sling pictured is a reproduction and would come with successful sale.Asking $1200. Feel free to ask questions/seek further pictures. Thanks for looking!"

The coating is beautiful and has not worn down or chipped in the 8 years I've owned this rifle. I've switched to .308 so this has been sitting in my safe, oiled, but unused. I have put less than 60 rounds through it since I bought it. The action is excellent and the rifle is a tac-driver. I've shot paintballs at 50m. The scope is pretty bare bones but perfectly adequate for hunting in North Carolina as flat as 30-06 shoots. It has cross hairs only, no bdc or mil dots. I also have about 100 rounds of ammunition I'm throwing in. Mostly assorted hunting loads, but also some match grade Hornandy which I used to test accuracy. This gun does shoot sub 1 MOA easily. I've verified that indoors at the Wake County Public Firearms Range with Match Grade ammo, best 5 shot group was touching. Basically, it will shoot what you the shooter are capable of shooting. I will only do an in person transfer of this firearm at a local FFL. If you do not want to transfer this rifle through an FFL, do not waste my time. Since I get inquiries all the time about this statement, first, I know that I do not need to do an FFL transfer for a rifle in North Carolina, so don't try to educate me. Because, second, I don't care. I have a job where I cannot have anything come back on me. Even though I know that if I have a bill of sale and a copy of your driver's license or CCP, I'd be fine, I don't want to ever have to go through that hassle. I'll even pay the transfer fee. So please, don't contact me if you don't want to do the transfer through an FFL.Thanks for checking out my listing. REDACTED."

This is not magnum ammo. It is of recent production by Winchester. It was made for use in very old guns. It will chamber in a .22 magnum gun but it is shorter than a .22 magnum. It will not chamber in a .22 LR gun. The ammo is clean and nice.

We are supremely proud to offer this gem of a shotgun, rarely seen in the gun market. Only 5000 were made, and the early version was even more scarce. Check your Flayderman's on this one. He states that the first production guns did not have the model stamped on the upper tang, and the patent dates matched that of the model 1898. The later, and more common version carried a 1904 patent date. Keep in mind that Marlin shotguns shared the same serial numbers, just like their lever action rifles did. The first model 16 was made in the 15,500 range, and this gun was made shortly thereafter. The highest number on a model 16 was over 142,000. To really spice things up, this is the nicely engraved C grade, with beautiful engraving, checkering, and highly figured extra select walnut. She sports an LOP of just under 14 inches to the factory Marlin butt plate. The top of the receiver is finely matted. The biggest number of questions about guns I offer has got to be ""Is it original?"" This gun is very original. She bears some light handling marks, and the blue has long since silvered out to a pleasing patina. She received good care, though. The stampings are clear and sharp, and the wood is all there. The action is crisp and smooth, and the full choke bore is bright and shiny. Barrels were only offered in 26 and 28 inches, and this is the long one. Touted as the lightest repeating shotgun, Marlin caused quite a stir with this model. Firing 6 rounds in 4 seconds made for some good bragging rights. This is a slenderized version of the 12 gauge model 1898, and I placed one in some of the photos for comparison. Both bear the unique engraving pattern designed by John Ulrich himself. WILLING TO SHIP,"

BRIEF DESCRIPTION:  The Sig P220 is configured as a double action / single action pistol and makes use of a de-cocker to lower the hammer for safe carry and uses no external safeties.  The Sig P220 is full-sized, but not overly bulky, and it fits my hand well. Relatively lightweight for a big 45, weighing in at just under two pounds empty, the Sig carries well in a good holster, and is very comfortable to shoot."
