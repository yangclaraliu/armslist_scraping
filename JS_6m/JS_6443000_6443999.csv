This was a ton of fun, but its a bit large for her hands and heavier than she likes. Plus she likes to rattle off 25 rounds as fast as she can more than she likes to shoot accurately. I want her to learn markmanship better... so a bolt action will hopefully slow her down. I am meticulous when it comes to the care of all my firearms. When I first bought this rifle in December 2011, it had a couple failures to eject. The extractor just didnt want to let go of the casing. I sent it to Mossberg and they replaced the entire bolt assembly. After getting it back, we logged about 600 rounds fired without one single failure of any kind. We took care of the break in period for you. I always cleaned and lubed it after we shot it. It is extremely clean. This rifle eats anything and is surprisingly EXTREMELY reliable. I started with Ar-22 specific ammo. Then, I tried general bulk ammo or whatever I could find when .22LR was difficult to get. It eats them all. It is very accurate as well. I sighted it in at Pine Tree pistol club as we usually shot indoors. If you can shoot, it can drive tacks. Not shown in the photos is a scope mount that is included. I put a scope on it at one point in time and was easily plinking wild apples at the outdoor range at 50yards out.Serious inquiries only. I will run your FOID card to make sure it is valid. I will write up an official bill of sale with both your FOID card and my FOID card scanned into computer and added to the document so we have each other's identity if ever needed. I will include a copy of the original bill of sale and the service form from when I sent it to Mossberg. $225 and it's yours. I think the price is fair. Cheaper than new and it's broken in, has any ""New gun quirks"" worked out, clean, pretty much like new, and proven to be reliable. It includes an extra mag as well. I dont have a box or case for it. Youll have to bring your own case to carry it out."

However, this hasnt been the case with most of the firearms we have tried since I acquired these rounds.  I do know that Glocks and Springfields won't fire those that have CCI 400s. Depending on what you shoot you may have some that you can't fire, but others will have no problem.Many people dont know much about the SST casings.  These are a very neat concept and I would encourage you to read up on them.  They are much lighter than a traditional brass case and unlike many casings with this appearance they are actually reloadable with the right dies made by Shell Shock Technologies.  A couple benefits I saw personally was the weight of the firearm was noticeably less than when loaded with brass rounds. Tigher grouping was also a difference with this case vs others casings of brass, nickel, or steel.Long story short, I wont ever shoot all of these, so if you are interested, try these things out.You NEED to understand that there is a possibility you will get some CCI 400s in your mix and they may not fire for you. Because of this possibility and the fact I want to keep everybody happy, Im going to price them at $0.20/ea in 1000 round quantities plus shipping.   That way if you happen to get some that dont fire, you wont have paid full price for them and you could find another firearm or just break down the components, oil the primer, punch it out and start over with a new case!Also,  I have quite a few, so if you want more than 1000 I can do that too."

Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol? The XD-S® Single Stack  from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there. The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it. The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use. Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™."

In the post-War years, as 1911s became increasingly common in the civilian market, shooters and custom shops found new ways to upgrade their .45s. Uncle Sam’s original spec sheet was a one-size fits all. But the 1911-loving public quickly figured out that America’s favorite autoloader could be improved with customization. The Loaded Series from Springfield Armory® brings you the culmination of those lessons. These pistols are Loaded with all the features a 1911 should have. Whether you’re looking for a pistol to use for target practice or home defense, you’ll appreciate the extended ambidextrous thumb safety found on all Loaded 1911s. Likewise, the ergonomic beavertail grip safety, lightweight delta hammer and extended trigger enhance handling and performance in any situation. But not every feature does all jobs, and so the Loaded Series is a diverse lineup. The variety of finishes, frames, calibers and sights means that there is a Loaded 1911 designed to handle your intended application. If you’re ready for a 1911 that brings you upgraded features without a custom shop price tag, look into the Loaded Series."
