The Mauser Construktion 96 was the Mauser Company’s most successful pistol and was even used by the likes of Winston Churchill during the Boer Wars. He is attributed as saying that it was “the best thing in the world”.This particular variant has a shorter barrel and is also known as the M1921 or the “Bolo”, the latter due to its association with the Bolsheviks and the Red Army after the Bolshevik Revolution. “Bolo” was a derogatory term for those who identified as Bolsheviks. The victorious communists purchased many of these pistols and likely scavenged them from their defeated enemies, the Whites, who also bought them in large quantities. These were certainly popular in other parts of the world as well and were heavily adopted by many in the post-WWI German Freikorps, who fought against communists in the Balkans.This specimen is in very good overall condition. 50% of the original blue finish remains. The bore is very good.

Has a 6” barrel. Has an eight round capacity that goes faster than a six round capacity.MUST have a Missouri CC Permit to purchase. Local pickup in Saint Charles area required.Revolver comes with orginal box and a cross draw OWB holster. Take notice to scuffs on ejector rod which is from me checking for a bent ejector rod (it is straight from what I could see.) There is a small difference in gap between forcing cone and cylinder as cylinder rotates. This is the only issue with the revolver. Apart from this the revolver shoots fine; groups decent.Originally purchased for squirrel hunting. Now that task is done with a rifle. I no longer have a need for this revolver.

Also Wolff spring pack, with the lightest hammer and trigger return spring installed has DRASTICALLY reduced pull in double action and made single action very clean. Factory springs and 2 other different weight combo Wolff springs come with it. Gun is a great shooter and Ive had it for very long but hardly shoot it anymore, just want to fund a new reloading machine set up is all.

This rifle is in .45 ACP and cannot be sold with the magazine UNLESS purchased outside of Maryland by a resident of a state which allows high capacity magazines. (Check your state law). These rifles where manufactured From 1969-1975 and take a standard Grease Gun magazine. It is quite the attention getter at the range! The rifle is old and thus has some minor dings, scrapes, blueing wear and such. The bottom left of the receiver looks a little chewed up as well but isn't as bad as it sounds and still functions properly and is the closest you can get to having a Thompson replica in the state of Maryland."

It is a Stevens 320 and was imported by Savage Arms. It holds 5 in the tubular magazine then one in the chamber. The Stevens 320 is very similar to the Winchester 1300. I would know as I have taken apart both firearms before. This particular shotgun had jettisoned its own bead sight from the gun while shooting slugs so you are just left with a threaded hole near the muzzle. I am not sure what the choke is on the barrel but it appears to be cylinder choke, also the barrel 18.5 inches long. The receiver has provisions to accept a picatinny rail and I could throw one in for a little extra. In my expeirence this gun has done good with wax slugs, Remington, Federal, Winchester bird shot loads and Winchester slug loads but it chokes on Suprema Buckshot and Hornady Buckshot(half of the time). What I mean by this is that sometimes it has a harder time than usual extracting and ejecting spent shells but it was never something I couldn't handle by getting aggresive with the pump. Most times this gun will open up the action a little when shot if you dont have a hand on the forend. Which isn't really a problem, but you should just be aware of this. So if you want simple, cheap shotgun you can abuse and not worry about damaging then this is your gun.I will probably be in Des Moines around November 18th-20th so I could meet up there if you wish.Feel free to contact me any time at REDACTED.
