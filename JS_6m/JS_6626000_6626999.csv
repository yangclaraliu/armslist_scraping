The 1905 designation is due to the 1905 adoption and issue of the .303 caliber Ross Rifle. However, the Ross was not originally equipped to allow attachment of a bayonet. The bayonet was officially adopted in 1908 - although patented prior to that in 1907 - but was not issued until 1910 (the confusion over model-year designation becomes very apparent). In reality this bayonet is best known as the Ross Rifle 1910 Mark II Bayonet.These bear the distinctive markings: ROSS RIFLE CO. / QUEBEC / PATENTED 1907 on the pommel, right (obverse); various acceptance/inspection marks can be found on the left side (reverse). These marks usually consist of: two-character designation II (for MkII); an ""arrowhead shape in a circle,"" the Canadian Government Ownership Mark; a ""crown over a number"" is a Ross Factory Inspection mark; and an issue date, i.e. 8/10 (August 1910).The .303 Ross Rifle and Bayonet were used by Canadian units in WWI from about 1914 to 1918. They were phased-out - when possible - by the .303 Lee-Enfield Rifle and Bayonet. Hilt has an oddly ""squared"" steel pommel; integral push-button/internal-spring latching mechanism. The cross-guard step - unique to the Mark I - has been removed on the Mark II as well as the internal muzzle spring.Steel crossguard with upper half being a muzzle-ring, lower half being a quillon with flat drum finial.Single-edged, knife blade is un-fullered; there are at least three accepted variants. The scabbards are brown leather.  Call or text 717-468-8446 $165.00  OBO"
