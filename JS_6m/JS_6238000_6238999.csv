Works with all types of 22lr. Never had this jam on me, which is one of the benefits of a revolver. The gun fires straight on and the sights are 100% accurate. I have been able to hit emtpy shotgun shells with this thing at 25 yards in a sitting position.

A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.Here is the link:https://diamondbackfirearms.com/collections/db380-pistol-series/products/diamondback-db380?variant=REDACTED8"

That being said, she's doesn't really have a job in my arsenal either so she's on the chopping block. She's got a keymod rail, MBUS Pro front and rear sights, and one of their older, three pronged, flash hiders. Like I said, runs fantastic, just eats ammo I don't want to buy and doesn't have a job. She's been well taken care of but needs a new home that'll take her out for walks, let her chase targets, and maybe even put some food on the table.This add is just for the Upper by the way. I have another posting for the entire rifle for those interested."

This is one of the hardest to find Daisy rifles for the collector.  It does have a piece broken off of the receiver near the tang, other than that it is in really nice condition and I have more pictures.  Here is a link to one that recently sold on eBay that is missing the exact same piece so if there is not somebody local who wants it I will put it on eBay.

$560 firm in cash or best trade offer will be considered.
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment.  Might trade for a CX4 in 9mm that takes 92 mags or the PX4 mag version and I'll get the 92 mag adapter.  Maybe the Kel-Tec Sub2000 Gen 2 9mm that takes 92 mags, might consider the Glock 17/19 version Gen 2, but needs to include a couple 15-17rd. mags and a few 33rd. mags, factory Glock mags please, not really interested in non-factory mags.

$600 firm in cash or best trade offer will be considered.
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment.  Might trade for a CX4 in 9mm that takes 92 mags or the PX4 mag version and I'll get the 92 mag adapter.  Maybe the Kel-Tec Sub2000 Gen 2 9mm that takes 92 mags, might consider the Glock 17/19 version Gen 2, but needs to include a couple 15-17rd. mags and a few 33rd. mags, factory Glock mags please, not really interested in non-factory mags.
No scammers and must be able to own a firearm in TX.  Can ship the upper anywhere for $20 more."

She's got a keymod rail, MBUS Pro front and rear sights, and one of their older, three pronged, flash hiders to complete the upper.Smith & Wesson Lower Reciever with a match trigger and Hogue Grip as well as a Heavy buffer and Enhanced Carbine Recoil Spring from Damage Industries are the guts for the lower. A Utility/Battle Rifle (UBR) stock from Magpul tops off the lower for a rediculously comfortable and consistant shooter.  She's had about 500 rounds through her but I'm cleaning out the safe and she's got the least milage on her. I'm just not a huge 300 BLK fan for the price rounds are at the moment. That being said, she's amazing to shoot and accurate as can be. Her only limiting factor is my willingness to buy 300BLK over standard 5.56 or 7.62. Like I said, runs fantastic, just eats ammo I don't want to buy and doesn't have a job. She's been well taken care of but needs a new home that'll take her out for walks, let her chase targets, and maybe even put some food on the table.This add is just for the full rifle by the way. I have another posting for the upper alone as well as the UBR for those interested."

$880 cash or better in trade.
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment.  Might trade for an excellent condition CX4 in 9mm that takes 92 mags or the PX4 mag version and I'll get the 92 mag adapter.  If you don't have as many factory mags(not interested in 10rd. or non-factory mags) as I do, I will need some cash, nice optic or other to make up the difference.  Might also consider a Kel-Tec Sub 2000 Gen 2 that accepts Beretta 92 mags or maybe even Glock 17/19 mags, but will need cash or other, since I can pick one up new for $450 right now.
