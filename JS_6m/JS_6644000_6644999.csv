These were finely tuned for my Savage rifle (FCP-SR 24""), but I recently had a new barrel installed and must now re-tune my reloads.
These are all loaded the same with IMR 4064 powder, 175gr Sierra Matchking bullets set with a competition ogive die, and Federal Match #210 primers.  The powder was measured to the hundreth of a grain.
The brass is assorted civilian brass that includes Lapua, PMC and Hornady.  The cases have been fired at least twice, but no more than four times.  The cases were cleaned with a liquid tumbler.  Packed in bags of 50, by case brand.
****This ammo's performance is slightly better than what I was able to get out of factory Federal Match 175gr SMK ammo.  I've used this ammo in tournaments, out to 1000 yards.****
Was $350.  Now $300!
If this ad is up, the ammo is still available.
**UPDATED**
I was asked some questions:
Brass sizing.  All these cases were full-length resized with my Redding die.  (in preparation for my new barrel)
Why?  These rounds are too hot.  My new barrel has added over 200fps to the muzzle velocity so I need to load a new batch for a slower rate. 
Cases are trimmed to, or under, 2.015"", chamferred and deburred.
Thanks."

I will not travel anywhere else or do the transfer anywhere else.I will be willing to ship the firearm at your expense through an FFL to your FFL, all I will need is a copy of your driver's license for my records and I'll message you my FFL's fax number for you to have your FFL fax to. The FFL's will do the rest one I get payment. It will be a cost of $90 for my FFL fee and shipping, so I don't think it will be worth it to you.  Before we meet, you will have to send me your valid Driver's license and FOID so I can run the number through the ISP for an approval number. Once we get the approval number, we can schedule the meet up. When we meet, I will have a bill of sale for both of us to sign and then we will be good to go! Should take less than five minutes. Illinois is very anti-firearm and the laws surrounding legal private transfers are particularly finicky, so I want to do everything as safe, legal and on the up-and-up as possible.

This Colt .45 comes in Excellent, Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition. While it does have some minor signs of wear/tear, overall, this pistol is in fantastic shape. This can be attributed to the fact that it was well taken care of, and only lightly used, despite having been previously owned, and originally manufactured in the 1940's during World War II. This pistol comes virtually unchanged from how it came off the assembly line, and features all of the original hardware and parts. The one notable exception are the grips. The grips on this pistol have been changed/replaced with a set of newer, more modern grips (though still from the same Colt line of products). The chamber and barrel of this pistol are very clean, having only been fired very lightly. The action slides back and forth with ease, and the mag drops and catches with equal ease. This pistol is both a piece of American History, as well as an excellent firearm. Please see our listing images for the EXACT condition of this item, and feel free to contact us with any additional questions or concerns that you may have."

The major noticeable attributes of a Fitz Colt are an open trigger guard and ""hammerless"".  This allowed the officer to use a holster with an open side so the finger is on the trigger as you are pulling it out.  First shot survives!  It fires well. Shoots both double and single action but single requires a half cock to get your thumb on the hammer.  (not really meant for single action)  Its a fun, unusual gun to the right guy.  Rubbber grips/pacmire style.  I will entertain any reasonable offer or trade."

For a Type 99, the stock is in beautiful condition, bright colored and original varnish with marks of character all over - not a faded and black stock that may or may not have been resanded, like most Japanese rifles. The AA sights, rubber muzzle cover, cleaning rod, and monopod are all original, but the dust cover and the sling I believe are repros, unfortunately. Chrome lining is still in good condition. Mum is ground off, but still partially visible towards the top of the receiver. The Japanese characters for ""Type 99"" are very visible, same goes with the serial #. Asking 800 or best offer.all IL laws apply."
