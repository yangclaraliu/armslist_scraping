I had every intention of not relisting again. I decided to do a little research just to be sure I had a below average price and beyond fair because I wanted to make a quick sale. Much to my suprise these have apparently gotten even harder to come by since the last time I checked and the cheapest one I could find was $200 above what I was asking. Yet I still was offered $200 less than my asking price. So I'm gonna try this again and all you lowballers can tack on an extra $200 if you want to try again for wasting my time. Prices are now firm and as follows. $800 cash you come pick it up price, $900 I meet you out of town, $1100 trade or with partial trade and cash. How you see it is how I bought it and how it will come. Rifle is in perfect working condition, bore is excellent, bright shiny with sharp lands and grooves. The only flaw if you want to get picky at this price is the finish of the receiver. The rear is properly converted, bullet guide installed. And its a pre Obummer russian trade embargo rifle. Not the new issue lesser rifle. Real deal Izzy. Send me all the hate mail and low ball offers you want. I'm just going to delete them while I laugh. I've been on armslist far to long to fall into your trolling traps and B.S. games. Yeah armslist hasnt treated me very well. Dont be a dick and i wont be a dick in return. Terms are absolutely firm, asking for any deal outside what is listed will get you ignored. If you aren't itellegent enough to read and comprehend a simple sales ad, you shouldn't own a firearm in the first place."

This example is in excellent condition both in appearance and mechanical function with just the slightest hint of wear on the very end of the muzzle. The hand-fitted lockwork is as tight as a new gun and the rifling is bright and crisp. These guns are capable of shooting the powerful .357 as well as .38 special rounds. The stocks in the picture are reproductions of the Colt full-checkered design. Included with the gun are its original Colt service style grips that are in excellent condition as well. I do not have an original box. The gun comes in a soft case. The value of this model Colt has risen rapidly in recent years and examples in this condition are getting harder to find. This is as fine a shooting revolver as has ever been made."

The Renegade + embodies everything a direct impingement AR-15 can be. With improvements such as our roller cam pin and patented heat sink barrel nut, these upgrades go well above mere aesthetics often found in rifles today. Put simply, the Renegade + addresses all of the weak points of the direct impingement system. The Dictator 9-position adjustable gas block gives you ultimate control of your rifle, whether tuning for ammo load or suppressor use. The straight gas tube eliminates heat build up from the weak points of standard gas tubes. And the roller cam pin ensures a smooth and more reliable relationship with the upper receiver.The Renegade+ is built off of our Gen 4 billet lower receiver and Ultimate Bolt Carrier Group. This receiver is completely ambidextrous and includes our flat 3.5 lb match grade trigger with KNS Precision anti-walk pins. Competition ready right out of the box. The magic in the upper receiver is held within our Ultimate Bolt Carrier Group which is high phosphate nickel coated for maximum protection & reliability and features an integrated gas key (no screws required). Like the Renegade, the Renegade + comes with our M-LOK compatible Renegade rail, covering the 16.5” nitride heat treated barrel.IF THERE EVER WAS A DIRECT IMPINGEMENT RIFLE THAT EXCEEDS ALL EXPECTATIONS, THE RENEGADE + IS IT."

There is also an alternative pair of sights included (I believe they are Dawson Precision) Also included is a front sight tool in case you want to change the front sight. A total of three guide rod assemblies are included ($80? value alone) with three different recoil spring weights so that you can fine tune the pistol to your load or to your suppressor for 100% reliability. $800 invested, sacrifice at $499 for a fast sale. Two small imperfections in the slide finish by the rear sight, see pictures. Can be touched up with a casey black pen, barely noticeable. This gun has only seen a couple boxes of ammo ran though it. There is zero throat erosion, a sure sign of light use.Must meet in OzarkCash only"

I am looking to sell or trade my MP5/HK94 clone rifle. It is made by MKE. It is an AT-94A2 model, very rare and high quality. It is made on HK tooling. The gun has only minor wear on the finish. Specifically where the lower connects by the magwell, which is typical of these. Comes with 5 korean mags, original MKE 10 round mag, claw mount top rail, and original case. Takes the 30rd mags and has necessary 922r parts. Has the restriction bars removed. These guns were made on HK tooling. A lot of the parts are interchangeable with true HK parts. They take any mags that HK94 take. These aren't ones that take only proprietary mags. The AT94 are more desirable and rare than other clones because they have a thicker barrel than the newer clones. There were only 700-1300 of these imported to the US. It's an all-around great gun. The recoil on this is non-existant. I have not shot any other factory 9mm that shoots smoother than this.Will trade for:PS90TavorAUGKushnapupOpen to firearm offersAT94A2AT94-A2AT 94A2AT-94 A2"

Majority of bluing is gone, very minor pitting is visible on the sideplate. The gun has two broken springs, but can still be fired. One broken spring allows the cylender to be rotaded counter clockwise when the hammer is down. This is not a huge issue and the original DA 38s didnt even have this part. The other more important spring is on the hand. I have found that the gun typically still functions, as long as you dont aim up. I have done some shooting with it, no major issues other than the occasional failure for the hand to return. This gun certainly aint for self defense, but I'd make a decent shooter or collector. It's chambered for 38 Long Colt, which can be loaded for using standard 38spl brass. I'll even throw in my remaining Black Powder loaded cartridges with the gun. The grips aren't original, and If you want new grips I have discovered that the gun fits Colt I frame grips. The gun is an antique, no need for a chl or ppp, but I will ask to see your driver's license just in case.I'm open for cash or trade offers, all offers will e accepted. Taking it to the gun show in Winston Salem, so no offer will be accepted untill after the show. Thanks!"
