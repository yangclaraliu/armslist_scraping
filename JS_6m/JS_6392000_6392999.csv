One of the magazines is a Pro-mag. Pro-mag does not make very good mags, it's fine for the range I guess but I don't recommend carrying it. The night sights are SigLite from the factory, still have a good amount of life left. I will even throw in a box of defense ammo.I'll give you the rundown of this package so you know you're getting a good deal:Sig P232 DuoTone w/1 mag (Sells for about $750 alone WITHOUT night sights & usually w/1 mag)2 Extra factory mags ($45 ea)1 Pro-Mag ($25)Nill Grips ($150)SIG Box50 rounds of Winchester PDX1 Defender 95gr JHP ($25)So you're getting about $1100 worth of stuff in this package, that's online prices before shipping & FFL fees, and Nill's 3 month wait to make your grips and ship them from Germany eh. Purchased locally, you'd be looking at a lot more.Asking $800 for this, which I believe is more than fair. It's actually less than I sold my old P232 for and that one was plain with no extras.Cash is HIGHLY preferred here.

Pmag.  This is a new unfired rifle that I never got around to doing anything with because of other projects.  I chose this particular AR-10 because I wanted a bit more range than a 16"" barrel would give and the medium contour barrel keeps the rifle as light as possible without compromising accuracy.  After looking over lots of ballistic data I saw no reason to go with a 20"" barrel, the gain in velocity was simply not worth the extra length and weight.  Again, the rifle is new but it was purchased around three years ago or so and just sat in the safe.  The only one I could find currently listed was one on Gunbroker for $1,650 in the same stock configuration.  I do have a Hogue or Blackhawk grip and/or Magpul MOE stock I can add, if wanted, just let me know.
I'll take $1,400 in cash or look at good trade offers.  This one cost well over $1,500 after tax and it's new.  
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and cash or??  Might also look at a Glock 19, maybe 17 with factory Glock 15rd. to 30+ round mags, prefer a Gen 4 with bright night sights, but will look at Gen 3's too.  Not looking for one that has been ""customized"", except maybe a trigger improvement.  If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.
Must be able to own a firearm in TX.  I can ship insured to another TX resident for $30 more.
Thanks for looking!"

This is a beautiful rifle. Hardly any signs of use, handling, etc. looks to be safe kept/ displayed for 99% of its life. Email me and I will send high detailed pictures of anything you'd like on the gun. I received this through a series of events, I am not the original owner and I don't know the history of this gun since 1949. Please do not expect me to know how many times it has been fired, how many owners, etc. it's your responsibility to come look at it and guess for yourself. The numbers and stamps all have hard edges and the metal has not been re-blued or redone. The stock IS ORIGINAL WALNUT, but may have been refinished in its lifetime. Again, i don't know for a fact, since it looks well done. I've never owned a fully original so I cannot compare. Hence why this isn't priced at 800+. No lowballing or wanting to trade terrible no name guns. I know what I have and it has been appraised well over asking. Will not ship. Will only meet face to face in daylight.

**** Text me @ REDACTED. Price is firm. No trades. Will sell as a package or can sell accessories separately. Without optic: $1,999.This rifle package has a $3,200 value & comes with:- Aimpoint Micro T1 w/ TD housing, KAC extended battery cap (provides 10 years battery life continuously running), ADM Mount, and Trijicon (pelican-style) case- KAC Micro flip sights, rear and front - Surefire + mount- KAC FDE foregrip panels- 2 Pmag 30 M3 Magazines- Standing bipod- Rifle caseThe Knight’s Armament Company SR-15 line represents the pinnacle of firearms based upon the Eugene Stoner designed operating system. The Mod 2’s 16” chrome lined, 5.56mm NATO barrel is manufactured to military specifications, and features a proprietary mid-length gas system that increases reliability and durability while also reducing felt recoil. An improved E3 round-lug bolt design both enhances function and increases bolt life far beyond the industry standard. An ambidextrous bolt release, selector, and magazine release offer left-handed users the ergonomic advantages inherent to AR15-based controls, as well as giving right-handed users alternative methods of manipulation to increase efficiency of movement. The drop-in two-stage trigger serves double duty as an aid to long range precision marksmanship while enabling surgical speed shooting at close range. The Mod 2 update introduces several notable features to the SR15 IWS line: a URX4 handguard with Keymod accessory mounting points for-ancillary device attachments increases cooling characteristics and reduces weight and bulk compared with standard 1913 rail attachment methods. A Mod 2 gas system with a proprietary design minimizes leakage and ensures more consistent operation in harsh conditions. A gas block secured with a locking ring instead of taper pins increases barrel rigidity and eliminates the need to custom fit the gas block to the barrel. Included parts and features, such as the two-sided receiver end plate QD sling swivel mounting point, collapsible six-position SOPMOD stock, hybrid ambidextrous selector lever, and folding 200-600 meter sights, round out the package to deliver a cutting-edge carbine right out of the case."

He is renowned for his precision rifle builds and his attention to detail is second to none. It currently has a KAC 3 prong FH as the muzzle device but you can easily put whatever you want there. Original box included. Previous owner did not shoot it (16"" format). I have put 100 flawless rounds through it since it has been SBRd for a functions check.  This is on a Form 4 in WA state.

The reason is I just have no need for it. I purchased this out of impulse thinking I would use it, but that just never happened.The one caveat to the condition pertains to the carrier only. I have modified the front of the carrier to better hold the front plate. I basically just unstitched the velcro, moved it up about 1/2"" and then sewed it back on. It doesn't affect the performance, and it is sewn in the exact same way it came from the factory. It just holds the front plate more snug. Prior to this modification, the front plate would sit about 1/2"" low in the pocket. The position of the plates in relation to your body is crucial to their effectiveness, so that is why I chose to improve the fit.Below is a list of the items included in this sale, along with their current prices if you were to go out and purchase them new right now.1) First-Spear ""The Slick"" Ultra Lightweight Plate Carrier - $92.112) TWO - AR500 Level IIIa Rimelig 10""x12"" soft plates - $99.00 EACH3) TWO - AR500 Trauma Pad 10""x12"" - $30.00 EACHIf you were to purchase all these items today new it would cost you $350.11 + tax/shipping.

The rifle and pistol share the “SUPER” serial number theme to emphasize their “Super” status among target shooters, hunters and collectors.This Super Match “SUPER1911” is hand-engraved by Rob Bunting of Baron Engraving in Trumbull, Connecticut. Rob is a highly skilled and creative engraver who has engraved some of the most popular firearms in SHOT Show auction history.In explaining the engraving pattern he featured on the Super Match II 1911 (and the SuperAmerica .308 rifle), Rob said, “First off, 1911's are one of my favorites to work on! When I saw the serial number was special, I thought I would try something a little different for this one. I tend to do leafy scroll, which I like very much, but I wanted to simplify the look this time around. This pattern has a very strong central spine with leaves placed more formally at regular intervals. The spine receives very little shading and the leaves are heavily shaded and cross-hatched, which creates a very strong contrast in the design. I think that is what makes it nice. I also removed a fair amount of background from between the scrolls and put in a nice strong punch dot pattern down to increase the contrast. Black fill in the cuts makes the whole thing pull together and pop.”The new Super Match II 1911is designed for competition right out of the box with all new features and an accuracy guarantee of one-inch five-shot groups at 25 yards. The .45 ACP features Kimber adjustable sights, fancy walnut grips and match grade trigger. Barrel length is five inches and weight is 39 ounces with unloaded 8-round magazine."
