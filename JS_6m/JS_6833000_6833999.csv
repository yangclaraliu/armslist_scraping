ThanksI will trade towards multiple cheaper guns, gun plus cash from you, gun plus cash from me, gun for gun, or whatever seems fair to the both of us.I am only trading for pistols, no long guns at all. I am specifically looking for the following.1) Gold coins at 95 % spot price2) Colt Snake guns Python , Anaconda , Cobra , King Cobra , BOA , Diamondback , Viper3) Colt guns ( I do like older ones)4) Nice revolver guns5) Nice 1911 guns 6) kimber k6 3577) Performance Center Guns8) Pre-lock Smith and Wesson revolvers9) Will accept ammo if still in the original box and at a really good deal. I can order ammo by the cases and get good deals so this is basically to even out trades or for bulk ammo at a good discount in case you have some calibers you don't need anymore. (mostly pistol ammo but will accept others possibly)Face to face transaction, I must see your concealed carry permit or get your pistol purchase permit. I will provide the same. If you do need to use a credit card, I do have an app that we can use but it costs 3% extra, and if anything goes through ffl, it is at your expense. I'm willing to help anyway I can on my end.

REDACTED Thank you and hope you have a good day.If you are looking for Colt Snake guns, I have some that I may sell for the right price. I also have several listed as I am thinning out my collection some. Look at my listings. ThanksI will trade towards multiple cheaper guns, gun plus cash from you, gun plus cash from me, gun for gun, or whatever seems fair to the both of us.I am only trading for pistols, no long guns at all. I am specifically looking for the following.1) Gold coins at 95 % spot price2) Colt Snake guns Python , Anaconda , Cobra , King Cobra , BOA , Diamondback , Viper3) Colt guns ( I do like older ones)4) Nice revolver guns5) Nice 1911 guns 6) kimber k6 3577) Performance Center Guns8) Pre-lock Smith and Wesson revolvers9) Will accept ammo if still in the original box and at a really good deal. I can order ammo by the cases and get good deals so this is basically to even out trades or for bulk ammo at a good discount in case you have some calibers you don't need anymore. (mostly pistol ammo but will accept others possibly)Face to face transaction, I must see your concealed carry permit or get your pistol purchase permit. I will provide the same. If you do need to use a credit card, I do have an app that we can use but it costs 3% extra, and if anything goes through ffl, it is at your expense. I'm willing to help anyway I can on my end.

There is mild fading on the high edges, as well as some flaking and patches of rose or plum patina, but no rust or pitting are noted. Engraving is beautfiully executed and nicely preserved, with coverage around 40% and flourish added to the pommel. Walnut grips rate as near excellent in line with the gun, having only light wear to the checkering. Apart from engraving, markings are correct and legible, with London proof marks on the barrel and cylinder, and serial number on the frame. Mechanical function appears fine in double-action, but the lower trigger does not set the hammer. This may be by design, or the gun may need attention. Additionally, there are two tiny loose pieces, which may be springs in need of replacements(see pictures). The bore rates as very good, but may clean to excellent. It is mirror bright with abrasive scarring, some lint and residue, and very light pitting. Included accessories are in very good or excellent condition, with the box having some hairline cracks on the bottom. Dixon flask and Tranter patent loading lever are both in excellent condition."

I also have several listed as I am thinning out my collection some. Look at my listings. ThanksI will trade towards multiple cheaper guns, gun plus cash from you, gun plus cash from me, gun for gun, or whatever seems fair to the both of us.I am only trading for pistols, no long guns at all. I am specifically looking for the following.1) Gold coins at 95 % spot price2) Colt Snake guns Python , Anaconda , Cobra , King Cobra , BOA , Diamondback , Viper3) Colt guns ( I do like older ones)4) Nice revolver guns5) Nice 1911 guns 6) kimber k6 3577) Performance Center Guns8) Pre-lock Smith and Wesson revolvers9) Will accept ammo if still in the original box and at a really good deal. I can order ammo by the cases and get good deals so this is basically to even out trades or for bulk ammo at a good discount in case you have some calibers you don't need anymore. (mostly pistol ammo but will accept others possibly)Face to face transaction, I must see your concealed carry permit or get your pistol purchase permit. I will provide the same. If you do need to use a credit card, I do have an app that we can use but it costs 3% extra, and if anything goes through ffl, it is at your expense. I'm willing to help anyway I can on my end.

This is the smaller framed 1911 with the 3.5 barrel and feautures a decocker, when the trigger is squeezed with the safety on, then the safety is turned off it will drop the hammer to decock it. The gun is in decent shape no major wear. It shoots great and is really a great feeling 1911. I bought this from the original owner who bought it in 1986. Comes two colt magazines extra grips on it and the original colt grips in a soft case. I do not have the original box.

I purchased this about 3 weeks ago from guns unlimmited in ayden for right at 802 after tax. The Shotgun has a few marks on the barrel from being kept on white wooden shelves in the gun store. Besides a few light scuffs its in great shape and only had a little over 25 rounds through her. It comes with the box and 5 choke tubes and a nice Limb Saver Air Tech recoil pad on it. Im looking for 800 on the Colt, 475 on the S&W 642 and 650 for the CZ. Those are cash prices.

The blued metal finish is a professional re-blue. There is some evidence of buffing with the S&W logo appearing a bit washed out. the finish shows only minor use since the re-blue. The hammer and trigger show nice case color. The checkered walnut target grips are excellent , no cracks or chips. The bore is clean with strong rifling. The action functions fine."

This configuration is identified in the Standard catalog of Smith & Wesson as the Model 29-4, with Product Code 101233, manufactured in 1989 with factory rings and square-butt Combat Grips. The Smith in this auction is an earlier uncatalogued Model 29-3, made in 1988 (even the accompanying Scope Mount Installation Procedure card is dated 06/88). This is a 6-shot, N-frame revolver with Wide Target color case hardened Hammer and Trigger, white outline adjustable rear sight, red ramp insert front sight, 8 3/8"" barrel with already described scope mounting system with rings, and beautiful rare square-butt Combat Grips. As it was made in 1988, it has desirable features no longer found on current Smiths: It has the square butt grip frame with wood grips, the firing pin is on the hammer, and there is no lock (new Smiths have round-butt frames with rubber grips, internal firing pins, and keyed locks that disable the firearm when turned to the lock position). It is in excellent used condition with few handling marks and very little bluing wear (there is a small area on the right side of the barrel towards the muzzle as shown in the pics). Additionally, there are powder burn marks in the bluing on the outside of the cylinder towards the front, corresponding to each chamber hole, from firing the weapon some time in the past. Please refer to the many detailed pics. Comes as shown with a Smith box not serial numbered to the gun, rings, manual, Scope Mount Installation Procedure card, and a bag of the self adhesive non-slip pads that are mentioned in the procedure card (probably a pretty rare factory item these days)."

The history behind this barrel is that it came off an old service rifle that was used for the MC Shooting Team. Im not sure how many rounds it has through it but I put it on my Ruger AR-556 and put about 60 rounds through it. This thing is a tac driver! I was hitting sub-moa mickey mouse heads at 100 yards with some 69gr 5.56 . It has some dings and scratches but they do not affect its performance at all. This comes complete with the front sight post, gas tube (pinned), barrel nut, and birdcage flash hider. I have found the civilian version of these stripped FN barrels brand new for $299 so I will let it go for $250.  I am having a baby and just have this thing sitting around. I Would rather someone that has the time, to go knock down some coyotes or build a nice match rifle with it. Feel free to contact me with questions."
