Bought new and replaced factory walnut stock with a stock from JAE. The stocks are made of aluminum alloy with titanium fittings, and this one has the  Titanium finish. These stocks are super-rare, and sell for $1850, you can get info about the stock and pricing at this link: (jallenglobal.com/rife-stocks/jae-100-g3/jae-100-g3-standard-orders/).  Comes with factory walnut stock, a Sadlak scope mount (the alum version, well known as the best M1A mount made), 8 brand-new Check-Mate/C-products 20rd magazines, 1 factory Springfield mag, the only one of which has ever been used, 3 double-mag pouches, and a hard case. I have put approx 150 rounds down the pipe, its super accurate, and you will be able to tell it has been babied as it doesnt even have a scratch on its feed ramp let alone anywhere else. Now I know that these days putting out $2500 in one shot is painful, but the fact is this is an INCREDIBLE deal for anyone looking to build up the ultimate M1A. The only reason we are selling is that we are having to sell our large homestead due to health reasons and will no longer be able to take advantage of this rifles capabilities at our new house. (We have a 350 yard range built here) The fact is, I HATE having to sell this rifle, its my baby, but I know it will simply sit in the safe forever, so I decided to let somebody give it the attention it deserves.You may contact me if you are interested in buying just the stock and its factory accessories/adjustment tools, and we can negotiate a fair price. This would let me drop the price on the rest of the package and make it easier to sell.I also have 1,000 rounds of XM118 Long Range Lake City 175gr HPBT ammo. This is the ammo manufactured for the military by Lake City/Federal for the military units using the M1A for sniper applications. This ammo is super-rare!, and goes for around $1.50 a round or more IF you can even find it for sale. I would be willing to cut a deal on the ammo (at additional price of course) to whomever buys the M1A package. I WILL NOT sell this ammo until the rifle is sold, so please dont bother to ask.Pictured on the rifle is a Leupold Vari-x Lighted Reticle scope and a Bi-Pod THAT WILL NOT BE SOLD WITH THE RIFLE! The scope is already dedicated to upgrade another rifle when this is sold.Prices As Purchased New:M1A: $1500Sadlak Scope Mount: $170Magazines: $275Pouches: $75JAE Stock: $1850Total price invested: $3,870Will sacrifice for $2500 CASH, FIRM. I must see/verify your Florida ID when meeting face 2 face only at a safe location. NO TRADES! We live at the FL/GA border north of Madison FL, and will be willing to drive up to 75 miles to meet for the sale. If ad is still up, its still for sale! Would consider selling VIA an FFL dealer to an out of state buyer if you cover all costs of doing so, but your funds must be covered first."

The COP .357 is an all stainless steel, double action only, tip-forward barrel derringer. It has 4 barrels and four firing pins which are triggered sequentially. The overall finish, grips and the 4 bores are in excellent condition. It comes with its blue factory hard case only.

From prairie dogs to elk, even combat if necessary. The 308 cartridge has proven to be an inherently very accurate and hard hitting round. With modern powders it rivals the ubiquitous 30-06. Fewer cartridges are more versatile than the 308 while still maintaining light recoil. It is available worldwide and at every Walmart. This rifle is unique in that it can chamber rounds longer than industry standard like the M118LR; all the way to 2.850"" in the mag. It is possible to mount a folding stock on this rifle if necessary. The barrel length is the ultimate compromise between portability and long range performance. There is no op rod to bend like an M1A. No gas adjuster needed for different loads or when dirty like the F.A.L. Having been impressed with modern semiautomatic rifles' accuracy like the AR15 approaching bolt action performance but allowing faster follow up shots; I went on a quest to learn all I could with this platform. First 223/5.56mm, then 308 winchester and finally the 6.8mm SPC. Because of the versatility of the 308 winchester and the severe wind in Wyoming; I settled on the 308 cartridge to keep logistics simple. Having been disappointed with the lack of reliability in my AR10 clone, and having seen firsthand how incredibly reliable an AK47 can be; I started to wonder if it were possible to have a marriage of the three!And now, I think I have found it! Imagine a semi-automatic 308 rifle with no gas port or operating rod to cause malfunctions over time. A lockup that is very tight, yet forgiving of debris. A ""battle rifle"" with FAR better accuracy than anyone has a right to expect! Magazines are cheap, reliable and readily available. I looked at and tried every proven design in the under $3,000 range; all of them wanting, except this one. Some were more accurate at the cost of reliabilty or ruggedness; but none were more reliable. And for me, reliability in all conditions is paramount. I have 3 of these rifles and will keep one for myself; this one is up for sale and will now fund my 308 ""habit"". Once you discover the genius in the Roller-Locked design, you will forego the ""Black Rifle Disease"".STAINLESS STEEL HK91 CLONE.Comes with 3-9X40 scope bore sighted.PSG-1 too expensive? Ever wish you could have a super accurate roller-locked rifle in 308? Well here's your chance! A cast Stainless receiver is VERY stiff and won't need the ""T""-rails added on like the stamped steel sniper HK rifles require. Only 500 of these made. Bolt and cocking tube gap are in spec; no ""ground bolt"". Comes with 2 mags. Upgrades so far: G3 stock and buffer, Bill Springfield trigger job. HK91 rubber coated charging handle. I DON'T SHIP!"

That is not the case. this pistol is in excellent condition with only slight marks of use. Note: This is a early transitional gun from the Series 70 to Series 80. You can tell by the late Serial 70 serial number. This has been confirmed by a Colt Collector. Thanks"
