I've fired a variety of ammo through it, both ball nose and flat nose out of it and I have never had a single issue with it. I've fired about 400 rounds out of it. Every time I'm done firing it, I clean it, lube it with Lucas gun oil, and put it back in its original hard plastic case. The pistol comes with one mag and around 20 or so flat nose rounds. I'm asking 200 firm. Thanks. It's the bottom pistol in the pictures. You can compare the size to the flat dark earth glock 26 that's in the pictures. The other pistols are not for sale at this time.

It was made in 1983. It comes with one factory 13 round nickel finish. The gun is in excellent condition with only some very minor handling marks as seen in the pictures. Refer to pictures for best insight as to condition of gun. I take my pictures outside in natural light, which generally (sometimes to bright or dark) shows more imperfections than indoor pics, which gives the buyer a better idea of the condition than I can explain or rate. Unless noted, I do not test fire the guns. I have a FFL and will ship for $30 insured. I will ship to CA, but it is the buyer's responsibility to verify with their FFL that the gun can be shipped there. I accept money orders, cashier's checks, and Visa/Mastercard"

The description they have is infinitely better than what I could've wrote. I am willing to ship after funds are received If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. Featuring two levels of tactical illumination, ambidextrous switching, a slender ergonomic design, and legendary SureFire reliability and durability, the DSF-500/590 is the ultimate WeaponLight for Mossberg 500 or 590 shotguns. This compact, lightweight system replaces the weapon’s original factory forend and features a recoil-proof LED that generates 600 lumens of blinding white light at maximum output, or 200 lumens with twice the runtime on its high setting. The LED’s light is focused by a precision reflector to create a smooth, wide beam perfect for closer-range shotgun applications typical in law enforcement and home defense—with enough reach and surround light to properly identify threats and maintain situational awareness. The DSF-500/590 features large, tactile momentary and constant-on switches on both sides for precise control by left- and right-handed shooters. Selecting the LED’s output is achieved by activating the light in constant-on mode and then pressing the output-mode selector switch until the desired output level (600 or 200 lumens) is set. The selected output can then be left in constant-on mode or switched to momentary activation, and it stays at that output level until reset. Every DSF-Series WeaponLight also features an integrated system-disable switch to prevent accidental activation during transport, storage, or stealth operations. A lightweight but strong aluminum module protects the optics, LED, and sophisticated electronics, minimizing length with side-by-side placement of the two lithium batteries that power the system. The module has a Mil-Spec hard anodized finish to protect against scratches, abrasion, and corrosion, while O-ring and gasket seals keep out moisture, dust, and debris. The slender forend body is made from extremely tough polymer and is textured for a secure hold and features large, tactile momentary and constant-on switching on both sides for precise control by left- and right-handed shooters. The DSF-500/590 fits as-is any 500 or 590 shotgun variant with a 6¾"" forend tube (magazine tube). An included internal spacer provides a proper fit for 7¾"" forend tubes. The DSF-500/590 provides unmatched power, versatility, and control, making it a must-have on Mossberg 500 and 590 shotguns used in combat, law enforcement, or home defense. NOTE: To see our other DSF shotgun forend models, click here. Fits: Mossberg 500 and 590 shotguns with either 6¾” or 7 ¾” forend tube"

The porting on the barrel severely negates muzzle flip. It's the softest shooting .44 I've ever owned. I'll include a hard case and half a box or so of ammo. For a little extra I can include a kydex shell and some stuff for the makings of a shoulder or chest rig for it.

NOTE: You MUST be able to pass a background check which includes the proper completion of Form 4473 if you come into our store to purchase a firearm from us (we do not handle the background check if the firearm is shipped to your FFL dealer). If you have a valid Alabama pistol permit issued after 8/1/2013, at our discretion, we will accept this in lieu of uploading your info to NICS. You will still be required to complete Form 4473 each time you purchase a firearm, but we will not have to upload the info to NICS and wait for a response. This will eliminate any potential delays. We have a Federal Firearms License (FFL). We will ship to your FFL... please call us for actual shipping quote. ...
