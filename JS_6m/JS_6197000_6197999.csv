It bears the US Property mark on the left side of the receiver wall. The No.4 MkI* was a wartime variation where a number of bells and whistles were eliminated to reduce cost and expedite production. While Savage did produce some standard No.4 Mk I rifle in 1942, they are extremely rare. As such, this rifle has a two position flip rear sight (rather than the adjustable ladder type), a simplified bolt release mechanism, and a handful of other minor differences. I'd like to trade for another C&R rifle or handgun. Send me a PM and feel free to make an offer, I'm open to anything! I've got a C&R license and will need to complete a bill of sale. I'm also willing to ship to other C&Rs or FFLs. This rifle is in good shape. There is some pitting on the receiver that appears to have been parked over during factory through repair (FTR or -> mark). While I've not shot this rifle, the bore is in good shape and it should be a good shooting rifle. It has a No 1 magazine, but it fits well. The bolt does not match the receiver and the stock has a BLO finish but not is not the original finish. The wood also appears to have been sanded years ago. The pictures should accurately depict the gun.more pictures http://imgur.com/a/jnj44"

How about this great custom Deadpool Colt 45 New Agent was created by Whiskey Tango Firearms in Sarasota, FL and is brand new, never fired. While you may not want this to be your carry gun it is a great collectors piece. This item will only be sold to verified Florida resident who also holds a CCP. Deadpool could easily be referred to as the antithesis of all things superhero, and yet the movie’s namesake did have a bit of hero in him (sort of). The movie was released immediately prior to Valentine’s Day 2016 and grossed $363.1 million here in the United States, pulling in another $419.3 million in foreign countries. Those numbers gave it a financial boost higher than all X-Men movies and although there is more, you’re not here for a movie recap. In the wake of Deadpool’s popularity, gun company Whiskey Tango Foxtrot recently unveiled their ode to the smart-assed vigilante: a Deadpool-themed pistol.Whiskey Tango Foxtrot chose a Colt 1911 and finished it as is befitting, well, Deadpool. The pistol has a red battleworn finish – because what other color would it be – and the mag is marked down one side with “chimichanga”. After all, as any true Deadpool fan knows, he loves saying the word…”Don’t even like chimichangas all that much. I just love saying it. Chimichanga. Chimichanga. Chimichanga” (Yeah, he said it. Check out “Cable and Deadpool”, Volume 1, #13). But the custom grips just might be the coolest part. The 1911’s grips are black with “Deadpool’s Gun” scrawled in white across the top and a red sketch of the masked man in question’s face which just happens to be reminiscent of his belt buckle, too. Then again, “Smile, Wait for Flash” is engraved into the muzzle. Basically, you don’t just want this gun. You need this gun.Located in the SW Florida area and willing to meet near any local Sheriff's or City Police Station for your safety and mine.Original Specs:New Agent .45 ACP 3 Inch Blue Barrel Trench-Style Sights Rosewood Grips 7 Round Mag, 1911 CompactSeries 80 firing system.

It is a vintage WW2 pistol with all numbers matching and in remarkably beautiful condition for the age of the pistol. The pistol comes with 2 P38 magazines as well as a german made P38 leather holster. There are no import marks or stamps anywhere and it is believed to be a WW2 GI bring back. Its smooth and tight constructions allows it to function perfectly including the De-cocker. I have test fired this pisol and it groups better than most modern handguns I own. Although this is considered a collector piece, it is very functional with todays inexpensive 9mm ammo and can be at home in the gun safe or at the range. Please contact me with any questions and I will be able to answer them to the best of my ability. It does have all german proof marks and can send pictures upon request. Cash is king.Will entertain trade offers.Thanks and have a great day."

Price is firm and the lowest you will find on a brand new Marlin 1895CBA. MARLIN 70458 1895CBA 45/70 6+1 18 WALNUT MARLIN FIREARMS CO Manufacturer #: 70458 Action: Lever Caliber: 45-70 Government Barrel Length: 18.5"" Capacity: 6+1 Trigger: Single-Stage Safety: Hammer Stock Description: Black Walnut Metal Finish: Blued This Model 1895 Cowboy Action Shooter is chambered for 45/70 and features a 18.5"" octagon barrel with deep cut ballard type rifling, 6-shot tubular magazine, adjustable marble semi-buckhorn rear and marble carbine front sight. The American black walnut stock has a straight grip, a hard rubber butt plate and a blue steel forend cap.Several people have asked if this rifle has the ""JM"" stamped barrel. This rifle was made in 2016 so no, it does not have a ""JM"" stamped barrel. If you are concerned about Marlin quality after they came under new ownership in 2009, rest assured, the troubles after the Remington take over in 2009 are long since over. I have personally owned a “JM” stamped Marlin Mod. 1895 LTD III 18 ½” octagonal barrel which is the same exact rifle as this one and there is absolutely no difference in quality in both aesthetic and functional terms.  In other words, the ""JM"" stamped barrel rifle I had just like this current production was in no way any better quality than this one. There was only a year back around 2009/2010 when these quality issues came up but it seems many are still stuck on that reputation. If that's you, you need to realize that that those quality issues are very much a thing of the past. These currently made Marlins are every bit as well built as the Marlins were before they came under new ownership and there are lots of reviews on Youtube that attest to this. So if you are looking for a real shooter instead of a sensationalized ""JM"" stamped rifle, here's one for you!"
