The rifle is a Ratmil/Cugir Romak-3 7.62x54R. Other designations of the model are PSL-54C, ROMAK III, and FPK to name a few. It is most commonly referred to as the Dragunov, though that is not technically the correct title. This rifle is in very good condition, the furniture looks great, and the bore is like a mirror with sharp rifling. There are scuff marks on the metal bluing from normal handling and storage but it doesn't appear to have been fired very much. Along with the rifle, the package includes: the original 5rnd mag, manual, scope and mount, extra scope mount w/ rings, original scope/mount manual, extra bolt, 5 other 10rnd mags, orig green mag pouch, surplus ammo can opener, cleaning/tool kit and pouch with 3 piece rod, green sling, and afolding telescopic bipod. I will ship to FFL if buyer is not local. Buyer pays for shipping. Asking price or best offer cash,no trades."

Lever Action Rifle. It has been used ever since it was bought, and is fully functional, with 60 rounds put through it a few months ago.Rifle shows age but is in good condition - minor scratches and rust present, as it spent the last 35 years under a bed. Sights, Action, and tube are all working perfectly, no FTF/FTE ever experienced with the good old lever-action setup. It may be old, but this is a winning design that still works like a charm and gives that massive kick so many years later.Price is firm, in cash, rifle goes to you along with a 20rd box of Winchester 30-30 Ballistic Silvertip hunting rounds.If you see the ad, this is available. I'm willing to meet at any FFL within mid Colorado (per Colorado law requiring a background check for private sales), though the closer to Castle Rock the happier I'll be.Remington, Marlin, .357, Ranger, classic"
