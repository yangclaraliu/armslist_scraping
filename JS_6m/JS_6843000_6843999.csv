It has the 6-notch adjustable rib, comb, and recoil pad. When I bought it the gun had been unfortunately stored in the case and drew some moisture. There was pitting on the right side of receiver and on the rib. I sent it to Kentucky Gun Coatings and they cerakoted all the metal; firing pin and springs were replaced also. There are still visible pits on the receiver and rib which can hopefully been seen in the photos. I had the cerakote applied about a year ago and still looks exactly as it was received. The wood is in good condition with normal handling marks, a few imperfections in the finish, and a couple scratches pictured. Overall, this gun is in good condition and is a perfect shooter. Great gun for singles and handicaps. I will include a Negrini case that is only a year old, factory chokes, spare parts kit, and 2 Muller chokes (U2, U3). Pictures can be emailed upon request."

Ammunition is a big part of this deal as I have about 450.00 worth of it. You get all the shooting loads like 5+ boxes of American Eagle FMJ, you get 6 boxes of FN ammo (3 boxes of SS197 and 3 of SS 195) You also get some carry ammunition, 2 boxes of SS 198LF (green tips - 6 rounds to make sure the gun liked it) and the topping, 2 boxes of Elite Ammunition's  T6 armor piercing...this is very expensive. To round it out, a belt slide OWB holster. Total you are looking at almost 2,400.00 here not including taxes. This gun is LIKE NEW! I put 300-350 rounds through the factory barrel, and 1 box (50) throught the threaded barrel...that's IT! This gun was purchased brand new last Fall, again it is like new. No trades please."

Other revolvers only latch at the ejector rod, but the Ruger locks up again at the front of the crane assembly making it extremely strong. Overbuilt with heavy stainless parts but not too heavy at 4 inches. Considered the best and highly reguarded as the most durable revolver on the market.

Creed: A set of fundamental beliefs.
For Walther, those beliefs are superior ergonomics, excellence in trigger design, and unparalleled accuracy, quality and reliability. The new Walther Creed makes a statement in modern polymer-frame handguns that all of these features can be achieved with an economic price-tag. The Creed offers a reinforced polymer frame with signature ergonomics that shooters have come to expect from Walther.
The Creed features a pre-cocked double-action trigger system and a bobbed hammer that ensure a no-snag draw from a concealment. This system provides the shooter with a light and smooth trigger pull, consistent from the first shot to the last. All metal components are treated with a corrosion and abrasion resistant TENIFER® coating, providing a matte black hardened surface. With an ambidextrous magazine release, low profile steel 3-dot sights, and front and rear cocking serrations on the slide, Walther refused to compromise on the quality or features of the Creed."

This applies to all 'categories' of shot.One category of shot is birdshot, used to hunt birds or shoot targets. The most common size, #7 1/2, is about .1"" in diameter.The other category is buckshot, generally used to hunt large critters such as coyotes or deer. In such a load, pellets as large as .38"" are carefully packed into a shotgun shell.Shotshells are available in either high-base (AKA high-brass) or low-base loadings. The high-base shells have more powder and are thus more powerful - use them when you need something extra.A shotshells come in various lengths. In 12ga, for instance, common lengths are 2.75"", 3"", and 3.5"".A shotgun can shoot shells shorter than its chamber (which will be marked on the barrel), but not longer.Longer shells have more pellets and more powder... and generate much more recoil. You'll only want to used them when you have to.Bore size is also a big consideration as 12-, or even 10-, gauge shotguns can be painful to shoot for some (untrained, sensitive, small, or weak) users. 16, 20, 28 gage, or .410"" shotguns are available which have much less kick and thus are easier to handle for such individuals."
