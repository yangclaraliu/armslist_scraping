I bought it for a build but ended up going a different way. I have the black. This is for M14/M1A. I reached out to Sage International and asked if it would fir their Mini14 chassis. Their response - Thank you for your email and interest in our products. At this time it is not possible to install our M14ALCS-BS MOD-0 butt stock kit onto our Mini-14 chassis. The hole spacing is not the same between the two and it would require machining to make them line up properly. The reason we do not offer our Mini-14 chassis with the Mod-0 butt stock is because it does not allow you to get your head low enough to see the iron sights. There are some pictures floating around online where customers have converted theirs or had a gunsmith do it but unless you run a dedicated optic it doesn’t really work. We are about 30-45 days backordered on our Mini-14 chassis stock system. If you have any questions feel free to call or email anytime."

It's not even broken in yet, or anywhere close. All additional parts were professionally installed. Weapon was properly cleaned after it's limited range sessions (bench shooting) and stored in my humidity and temperature controlled safe. Please see the complete list of modifications below. I built this rifle and then put it in the back of the safe. It just doesn't get shot because I'm too busy and don't get many chances to shoot longer than 200 yards where this baby will really shines. This rifle is plenty capable of a thousand yard shot with the right ammo. I can attest to it ringing steel at 760 yards (laser verified) with a cheap scope (prior to my Vortex) using PRVI cheap NATO BALL ammo from the white box. I'm asking $3550.00 shipped to your FFL with insurance. It's a fair price given everything it come's with. This price is the lowest your going to find with a rifle built up as beautiful as this. I'm practically giving this away at this price. I just don't use it like I thought I would and have other projects that I'm working on. I'll also include the factory stock ""space boot"" if you would rather have that than the stock and tube combo currently on it. This ad will be cross posted. I'll accept PayPal plus the 4% processing fees if it makes the buyer feel more secure, USPS money order. I'm flexible in that aspect as I want the buyer to feel comfortable as I understand this is no small chunk of change. PM for more details and to make arrangements if interested.

Additionally I will be posting your email address on facebook in the gun talk groups to let everyone know who you are so they know you are a weirdo who has nothing better to do than harass women.
