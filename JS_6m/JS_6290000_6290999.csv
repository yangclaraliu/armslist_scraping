Do your research, there were very few of these models made, and if you google search this model the few that you will find all have the same LF111xx serial number prefix. Im not saying this is a 100 gun production run, but the only others that I have seen all have the same LF111xx serial number starting the 5 digit serial number.

Seems to function well.  Other than the trigger pull, doesn't have any safety.  Very simple design.    Not much to snag on, so would be great for occassional pocket carry. If it doesn't sell quickly, I plan on refinishing it and charging a little more.  If you are looking for a small conceal carry, and don't really care about looks, then this pistol might work well for you.  I believe the magazine holds 8 rounds.  Weighs about the same as a Raven, but carries 2 more rounds. Has a grove on the slide for sights. Strictly for up close and personal protection."

This has been sitting on my nightstand or in my humidity controlled gunsafe ever since... it's in perfect shape with no scratches or wear, I also still have the original hardcase for you. I've installed the kriss factory rails on each side with surefire rubber rail covers. I've also purchased the streamlight TLR2-G laser light combo that is 720 lumens with strobe and the green laser is visible in the dark with a full beam rated at one mile. This is also a lifetime warranty light combo that's waterproof and VERY nice!!! Gun has the kriss factory brace that can be removed with the pull of one pin for easy storage into a backpack or small space. Magazines are factory glock 32 round mags and one 19 round mag. I've also got the folding kriss stock that can be attached with one pin if you decide to turn the pistol into an SBR. I have only used the gun in pistol format but went ahead and got the stock incase I decided to convert later. I removed the magpul flip up sights and replaced with cz scorpion sights to make the gun more compact and cosmeticly more appealing. I absolutely love this gun and anyone who sees it in person thinks it's amazing. Probably one of the coolest guns on the market. Just ordered a new rifle so I'm selling this to cover some of the funds. With tax and accessories I have over 2000$ invested. Thanks for looking"

It's a Rock Island Tactical in .45 ACP that has had quite a bit of work done to it. Of which it has the following: polished compensator, polished trigger, polished hammer, upgraded spring, new trigger group(3 pounds), ambidextrous safety, heavily polished barrel and slide, punisher grips. This thing shoots better than any of the other 1911s I own in stock form including my kimbers. A lot of time went into the minor details making this piece smooth as silk. I would put a cash value on it of $600 obo and a trade value of $700.I am looking to trade for a Springfield XDS in 9mm and it must come with extended mags, springfield holster and mag holder.

But for now, that’s all my budget will allow. I have my eye on a SCCY CX-1 or a Ruger LC9. In order to swing that, I need to sell something I already have. Here it is.
Walther PK380. Less than 500 rounds have been sent downrange (always cleaned and oiled). The handgun comes with three OEM 8 round magazines with finger rests, an OEM Walther laser (easily removed), original plastic hard case, and take-down tool.
The handgun itself: 380acp. Conceal carry design. Features low profile three-dot polymer combat sights, Tenifer coated slide and barrel, loaded chamber viewport, rear slide serrations and ambidextrous manual safety. Ergonomic Walther grip, paddle-style ambidextrous magazine release levers, ambidextrous slide stop. Picatinny accessory rail. Double/single action trigger. 11 pound pull for double action; 4 pound pull for single action. Eight round magazine with finger rest. It is small and good looking. That makes the PK380 excellent for concealed carry. Its small grip is ideal for shooters with small hands although it fits perfectly in my big paws. The slide is easy to operate, making it a good choice for women or guys tired of breaking a sweat every time they have to rack the slide. At 18oz it’s easy to carry and conceal.
$385 firm. Must have valid Wisconsin DL and a Wisconsin CCW, no exceptions. Located in Waterford (western Racine Co.)."

Pack was never carried outdoors. It only served as a storage bag for a few of my shooting items in a climate controlled basement. This pack includes the additional Eberlestock Shotgun/ small rifle scabbard mounted to the side along with the Eberlestock Saddle bags mounted on either side. In addition it has the Eberlestock Rifle Rest attached to the back. Internally are two additional pouches I've included that can be mounted anywhere to organize the load bay to your liking. Pack also comes with the Eberlestock Coyote waterproof pack cover in compact drawstring bag. (The accessories alone are worth over $150). This pack can fit most any rifle one would like to carry. It has the adjustable scabbard cover for various rifle lengths. The Gunslinger 2 also has an integral support system and belt which makes this very comfortable over long hauls (I know because I carried the Tan version of this for 100s of miles over my career). Please contact me with any questions or for additional pictures. Below is additional information from the manufacturer:The G2 is the latest evolution of the original GS05M Gunslinger pack, and both are in wide use by elite military, police, and civilians all over the world -- snipers, marksmen, and regular folks who appreciate the overwhelming utility and versatility of this product. It's a mid-sized pack with a full-width scabbard to better accommodate weapons with larger cross-sections or bulky optics. The wide scabbard also allows it to serve as an excellent laptop or military radio compartment, and because it's also wide at the bottom, users have the option of carrying weapons butt-down or butt-up. Like the G4 Operator pack, it features both front loading and top loading features, giving exceptional versatility and flexibility of useThe newest version of the G2 comes standard with our Intex-II frame system. The Intex-II is an Eberlestock innovation; it out-performs both traditional external frames and internal frames, and has the best qualities of both: the structure of an external frame without the noise and with minimal weight, and the close-ride and comfort of an internal frame pack. The Intex-II adds a new level of support and stability to the Gunslinger II, making it a compact and tough heavy-load capable pack. It can be interchanged with our Endo frame, as well as more compact, softer frame called a Gossamer frame, or can simply be removed, which effectively reverts the pack back to the traditional G2 platform.Our new padding configuration covers critical comfort points on the users back. It is optimized for both direct-to-back comfort and for stability over body armor. It allows for maximum breathability and optimal contact points.The scabbard of the G2 folds into the bottom of the pack and is secured by a buckle. This configuration is good for shorter weapons and other gear; it also makes the scabbard a great place to carry a laptop computer.Also note the side handles; these make it easy to get the loaded pack out of a vehicle, and for mounting the pack with a heavy load.Heavy duty compression straps cause the pack to ride quiet and tight, and it can be compressed completely flat. In this photo, they are routed through the scabbard compression loops, which allows you to selectively compress the scabbard.  NO TRADES PLEASE"

This Rifle was purchased along with several others from a museum in France that was closing their doors. This Rifle is believed to be the same one that Konrad Staheli used to win the Gold Medal at the 1900 Olympic Games in Paris France on the 300 meter kneeling Rifle as well as many of his other 117 Medals and 24 World Chamionship Titles. The extensive research that I have done points to this being the exact rifle including information given to me by the museum where this Rifle has been on display for the last 60 years. This is an incredible opportunity to own one of the only Olympic Gold Medal Winning Rifles known in private hands today as the large majority of them are in museums. In the pictures below I am including a picture of Konrad Staheli holding this Rifle proving this is indeed the one that won Olympic Gold. This was displayed in the museum as the Rifle that won Olympic Gold in the 1900 Paris Olympics as well as the World Championship in all three Target positions at Lyons in 1904, Zurich in 1907, Hamburg in 1909, Rome in 1911, Biarritz in 1912, and camp perry in 1913. I have spoken with two very large auction companies who would love to have this Rifle for one of their upcoming auctions but given the very steep consigning fees I wanted to try and sell it here first and if it doesn't sell it will go to one of these auction houses. The price I am listing this at is below the estimate given to me by either auction house proving the rarity of this Rifle. Keep in mind that this Rifle not only won a gold medal in the olympics but was owned by probably the greatest target shooter of all time. Now to the Rifle itself. The Rifle is in incredible condition for its age and the bore is immaculate and would rate a 9 out of 10. It features fully adjustable front and rear sights ( windage and elevation) with the rear sight having many different adjustments and the front sight has the option of interchangeable blades. The Rifle is very heavy and tips the scales at 12.2 lbs. The barrel is very heavy and has flutes running nearly the full length of the barrel. It also features double set triggers and a target stock with a raised cheekpiece and Swiss Target buttplate that cups your shoulder incredibly well. The Rifle is chambered in .41 Swiss and I will be including the cartridge shown for display with the Rifle. The case coloring is still visable on both sides of the receiver, lever, and breechblock. The Schutzen Museum in Switzerland has a whole wing dedicated to Konrad Staheli including a gun nearly identical to this one being held by a life size figure of konrad but that one isn't the one that won the Gold Medal in the olympics since it has a palm rest/ lever attached to the underside of the forearm which weren't allowed to be used in the kneeling portion of the olympic contest for which his gold medal was one. This information along with the picture I have provided with him posing with this exact gun has me nearly 100% convinced this is the Olympic gun as it does not feature a palm rest lever. The only drawback I can find is that the wood forend has a small very tight crack that could be repaired quite easily. The barrel finish is a mix of original brown as this gun was originally browned not blued and silver/Grey as its starting to loose its finish in places but it is an overall very pleasing patina color. If his gun can be 100% positively identified as the Gold Medal Winning 1900 Olympic Rifle of Konrad Staheli such as through serial number which I believe can be found through Olympic records with more research you are looking at a $20,000 plus Rifle if sent to auction. Even if it's not the Gold Medal Winning rifle it was still owned and used to win many championships by arguably the greatest target shooter who ever lived. With that said serious inquiries only. Many pictures are available to send. Email, call or text REDACTED"
