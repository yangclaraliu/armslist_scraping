The Rhino is the most innovative development in revolver technology in decades. It fires from the bottom of the cylinder rather than the top which dramatically reduces muzzle rise and recoil felt by lowering the axis of the bore almost to the palm of the shooters hand. An aluminum alloy frame and barrel shroud makes the Rhino lightweight and easy to carry. The snag resistant ""hammer"" is actually a cocking device because of the Rhino's innovative completely enclosed firing mechanism which can be fired either single or double action. A cocked indicator is clearly visible to indicate the internal hammer status. Another innovation is the hexagonal cylinder which keeps the revolver's width to a minimum. Included is a fiber optic front sight.

Armor-Tuff Black with Armor-Tuff ODG Camo. Chambered in .223 Wylde. Rifle-length has system with lo-profile gas block. NP3 coated BCG. Starburst gunfighter grip. There are times when extreme accuracy and follow-up shots are the most important criteria when selecting a rifle. Those were the primary objectives for the engineers at Wilson Combat when they designed the SS-15 Super Sniper - and the results far exceeded their expectations. It has a 20"" long, 1-in-8 twist, heavyweight, fluted, stainless steel premium match-grade barrel - optimized for the longer, heavier bullets used for long range shooting. The crispness of the trigger is unequaled in AR style rifles; it is tuned for a 4 pound pull. This gun is engineered, designed and built to deliver unmatched accuracy at 300, 400 or even 500 yards and it does it in almost unbelievable fashion. SW OkC. REDACTED."

The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant edge finish and SIGLITE Night Sights. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs seven plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters."

I am not interested in trades, and I can usually meet the next day.Thank you for looking, and hopefully someone can use this as it's a great deal and some equipment in excellent shape.-Mike"

It's easy to conceal yet it's actually fun at the range, this could easily be a great do-all gun, or truck/tackle box gun. So why am I letting it go?

I have decided that I sadly won't have time for reloading, therefore I am selling off a lot of equipment, supplies, etc. Be on the lookout for more listings from me as there will be a lot of good deals for reloading tools and components for 223 and 6.5 Creedmoor, as well as general tools.Price: $100 (new they are $120-135 before shipping)I live in the Grant area and work in Huntsville near the Research Park/Gate 9 area. I will meet in between those locations, but prefer just to meet at Cabela's in Huntsville if you're in the Huntsville/Madison area. I am not interested in trades, and I can usually meet the next day.Thank you for looking, and hopefully someone can use this as it's a great deal and some equipment in excellent shape.-Mike"

For peace of mind for buyer, I do not have any issues with buyer choosing a FFL to act as middle man who will accept gun on buyer's behalf before payment is sent, if buyer so chooses.
