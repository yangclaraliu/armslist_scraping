Mil-spec dimensions and coating ensure the highest quality and correct component interface. The 5.56 Mil-Spec chamber allows you to safely shoot 5.56 & .223 ammo. The 1:7 twist also allows you to shoot heavier (77 grain and above) accurately from this rifle. ARs purchased with a .223 chamber may be unsafe when shooting military ammo (excess pressure build-up) because of the difference in chamber throat length. The 5.56 chamber will allow you to shoot both 5.56 & .223 safely. The 5.56 chambered weapon is therefore is the best overall choice for self defense because it will fire whatever ammo is available.I will only sell to the holder of a valid Tennessee Handgun Permit.  Flakes and lowball offers......please don't contact me."

Still in like new condition. Completely coated inside and out for the best protection possible and seamless appearance. Custom sight, slide, and trigger work. Buttery smooth recoil (enhanced by the slide work), dead nuts (sight work), and runs every round every time (custom trigger and internal work).  All the internals including the hammer, trigger, pins, etc. have been changed out with original Beretta parts. The barrel and recoil spring/rod were retained (because they're better than the original Beretta 8000 parts). It's a badass. This version of the 8000 has the hardened steel spring rod and hammer forged barrel (as opposed to earlier models with a polymer spring rod and non-forged barrel). No low balls please. There's more money in custom work done than the gun costs new. I like the 8000 series pistols and the Stoeger's are the only ones (that are easily accessible anyway) with a rail. It was worthy of the upgrades and is an excellent pistol.  I just don't use it as much as it should be used so it's time to move on."

Mdl: 051815490      3.625” Barrel     MSRP: $639.99 NIB SALE PRICE $499.99
 
Browning’s 1911-22 has made .22 popular again. This high strength, light weight, A1 style compact is constructed with a polymer frame design and was originally introduced in 2011. Gun reviews have been favorable attesting to the design and construction holding up well. Weighs under a pound when loaded and fits both large and small hands while still retaining the safety and “manual of arms” of the original John Browning 1911 full size with blowback slide action and single-action trigger.
 
Standard features include stainless steel barrel block, target crown, machined aluminum slide, fixed sights, steel 10 round magazine, manual thumb and grip safeties. But this gun comes in a compact 6.5” length overall which is approximately 85% the size of a full size 1911.
 
The “Black Label” models have enhanced features such as laminated and stippled grips with checkered front strap, matte black finish, extended ambidextrous thumb safety, Beavertail grip safety, Commander style hammer and extended slide release.
 
At the most recent Wichita area gun show there was only one 1911-22 and that wasn’t a close match to this gun as it was a used, earlier specimen with the first generation “flat” black finish selling for $525 without the case and paperwork. 
Yes. The base Browning 1911-22 with pink grips or the tan frame is available at various stores for $499.99. But add to that tax. And then consider that it is the base model without the “Black Label” enhanced options. You’ll especially appreciate the Beavertail grip safety on the one for sale. Abd so this NIB 1911-22 is a great deal for someone.
This gun is New In Box and never shot or registered for the warranty. Comes in the original ABS factory case with all factory options and documents. Local delivery in Wichita or the surrounding communities available if purchaser has a CCW. Otherwise gun will be shipped from my FFL for a flat rate of $25.00 paid by buyer in addition to purchase price shipped to your FFL. Buyer is responsible for his/her own FFL fees."

Must be at least 21 years or older and be a Kentucky resident to buy/trade this gun. Proper ID required (I will check). $600. Cash price is firm. So no low ball offers, or it will be ignored. So don't waste my time and yours. Trade value is $650. Must meet around the surrounding counties only. Will not travel more than 40 miles to meet if you're from out of town. I like this gun a lot, but I want something else. Thanks for looking."

Chambered in everything from .17 HMR to .22 LR to .44 Magnum, these rugged, durable revolvers also make a practical choice for backpacks and tackle boxes, especially where there are bears and other predators around.

Porting
Referred to as factory tuned porting and gas expansion chamber for recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality.
Ribber Grip
Exclusive Taurus ergonomic shock absorbing grip design provides a firm grip under virtually all shooting conditions.
Taurus Security System (TSS)
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
7 Rd Cylinder Feature
Some Taurus models offer our 7-shot cylinder. A shot above the rest.
Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the

The VLR II Laser Rangefinder by Bushnell features ARC (Angle Range Compensation) which compensates for extreme up and down angle, providing bow-hunters true distance range from 5-99 yards. The rangefinder is small enough to fit in your hand and in a shirt pocket and delivers instantaneous distance readings from 5 yard minimum all the way to 999 yards on reflective objects (300 yards on deer sized animals and 600 yards to trees) with extreme +/- One yard accuracy. Bushnell VLR II Laser Rangefinders feature 5x magnification and fully coated optics. This Bushnell Range Finder has a liquid crystal display (LCD) that is mounted within the optical system and when activated, displays a reticle for targeting and a yards indicator. The Bushnell 5x24 VLR II Laser Rangefinder - DEMO solves a problem bow-hunters have been faced with for years; extreme uphill and downhill angles altering the true horizontal distance to the target."

The gun has exactally 900 rounds through it now. All of which came out flawlessly. I bought the gun brand new about a year 1/2 ago. If it's possible I have 1 too many 1911's and a few too many mags, if that's possible too. (Went a little over board) i also have 2 8round Wilson combat mags and 2 10 round Wilson Combat mags, plus the 2 factory mag that work great as well. The Wilson combats were never used still in the package.     My other 1911's are not expendable, they consist of Ed Browns and Wilson Combats. Tho I wouldn't hessatate to buy another Sig 1911 Nightmare if I didn't have my others. Prolly would of saved a bunch of money In the process. It goes bang every time for a lot less $. I feel it's a lot better of a buy then a Kimber in that price range and more.    I'm selling for $800. I see them selling for $1000 brand New. So with the mags I'd say its a good deal. The way I look at it, is I bought it and broke it in for whoever buys it next. 900 rounds is nothing on a 1911.    Any questions feel free to ask. My number is REDACTED. Thanks. P.S. I understand it's a 1911 so you can try it before you buy it. Shoots great and every time!"
