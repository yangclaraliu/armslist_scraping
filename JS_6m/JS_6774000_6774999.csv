And the Sig SBX Pistol Brace.  Additional upgrades include a trigger job, consisting of replacing the trigger springs with reduced pull weight springs, polishing the FCG, and an upgraded trigger bow.  I have also replaced the original pistol grip with a slimmer and more vertical pistol grip.  It has a much better feel and greatly improves the pistols look as well.  This Scorpion has also been equipped with a small reflex sight/red dot optic, a Barska green laser sight with pressure switch, and a 320 Lumen compact tactical light with strobe.  The laser sight is mounted below the barrel with its pressure switch on the right side of the handguard while the tactical light is mounted on the right side of the barrel and the front of the handguard.  Both may be easily turned on or off with your front hand that is supporting the barrel.Again this pistol is brand new and has simply been upgraded with the Phase 5 pistol buffer, Sig brace, side-Folding adapter, and other items mentioned above.  It comes in its box with manual and includes 4 32-round magazines, and 2 20-round mags.  Note that all original parts, which have been replaced as part of the aforementioned upgrades, are included with purchase."

The DeltaPoint pro uses Leupold's Motion Sensor Technology™ (MST) that automatically activates the illumination when the weapon moves, and switches to stand by mode after 5 minutes of inactivity. An Auto-Brightness sensor continuously samples lighting conditions to provide optimal reticle intensity, or can be overridden should the shooter prefer the manual mode. The exterior lens surfaces are treated with Leupold's DiamondCoat™ that adds abrasion resistance and durability, and assists in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast. The aspheric lens creates a wide field-of-view, with sharp image quality, allowing user to keep both eyes open and focused on the target. Slotted windage and elevation dials allow positive 1 MOA adjustments without the need of lock screws. The Leupold DeltaPoint Pro Reflex Sight is constructed with a lightweight aluminum housing, shrouded in spring steel for maximum durability, and has been waterproof tested to 66 feet. Includes battery, and protective cover."

Came with an action job that lightened both the trigger and the hammer pulls. When I bought it, it had some slight timing issues, which have since been corrected. Overall, an excellent reproduction of the famous Colt Peacemaker design, at a very reduced price, good for anyone looking to just get into cowboy style shooting. I'd keep it myself, but my eye has since been caught by the other kind of ""Colt .45"", and I'd like to start directing my funds that-a-way. Price may be negotiable, or tradeable, and the worst that I'll say is no."

I could use some cash this week, but I'd also like to have another carry handgun. I don't care the shape as long as it goes bang. I bought my xdm from Springfield, and paid extra to have them install trijicon night sights on it. It comes with 3 factory mags, a dual mag holster, a speedloader, 3 removable backstraps, gun lock, barrel brush, and all the manuals and literature it comes with. The only thing this doesn't have is the original holster.(the only time this was shot, it was left at the range) So this is one of the best handguns to own, and with the match grade barrel it's crazy accurate. It's only had about 100 rounds through it so it's still pretty new. You can text or call me anytime at three17-six52-five523, my name is Chris. Buyer will need to meet me somewhere public in Noblesville and be willing to sign a bill of sale and show proof that they are legal age to own."
