The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. Available in 9mm, and .40 S&W. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.

This rifle is in very good  condition. It has been owned only by myself and was bought brand new by myself. This rifle has only seen 3 magazines shot out of it. 90 rounds total. I took it out to the range, tested it and then cleaned it and never shot it again. Comes with original box, manual, a 5 round magazine and a 10 round magazine. I also have a VEPR Version 2 20inch 7.62 by 39 that is still brand new/ never fired. I figured I would combine both into one listing. That rifle is the same as this but has a 20 inch barrel and integrated front sight. Bought brand new by myself but never got around to shooting it. Also comes with original box, manual, and 5 and 10 round magazines. Very busy schedule and do not have time to shoot much anymore so I figurd these rifles could go to someone who appreciates and uses  them more. For the used VEPR im asking 500 dollars. For the new version 2 VEPR with 20 inch barrel, im asking 600 dollars. Both prices are below what these AK's cost brand new on the market currently. Any questions feel free to ask. First come first serve. Will ship if needed. Thanks."
