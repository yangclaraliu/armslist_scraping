The HOGAN gun system has been designed and manufactured to greatly decrease/eliminate heat, carbon build-up, gas leaks, fouling and wear/tear on operating parts which can have an adverse effect on an operating system.  Each piece of operating system is hard chrome plated and/or melonite heat treated making them almost self lubricating and act as non stick surfaces making them easy to clean and maintain.  Operates in semi-automatic, but can be made full-auto for Military and Law Enforcement.UPPER RECEIVER:  Billet machined from 7075 aluminum forgings, (aircraft aluminum alloy), into an A3 flattop upper receiver to fit varied handrails or a 1-piece upper receiver to fit our Free Floating Monolithic rail system Finished in black anodize , NP3™, O.D. green anodizeCHARGING HANDLE:  Billet machined from 7075 aluminum bar stock, manufactured with an oversized grip and locking latch.  Black anodized to Mil-Spec 8625, duo colored with electro less Nickel coating/black anodize to Mil-Spec 9625 or NP3™ coated, (depending on customer preference or firearm design).HANDGUARDS/RAILS:  Aircraft aluminum alloy precision machined from 6061 T-6 extrusion Free Floating Monolithic Tactical and Hunter hand guards or Monolithic top rail finished in black or O.D. Green anodized.GAS BLOCK ASSEMBLY and GAS PLUG:  Gas block: billet machined from 4140 aircraft quality steel bar stock, heat treated to Mil-Spec.  Gas tube: 4130 aircraft quality tubing. Block and tube are joined then mated with barrel (matching serial#’s added), then melonite heat treated together.  Gas plug: billet machined from 4140/4142 steel bar, heat treated to Mil-Spec, ground to size, mag phosphate on top, NP3 coated, and/or chrome plated with blackened top.BOLT and CARRIER:  .223 bolt: machined from 9310 steel bar stock, phosphate heat treated to Mil-Spec .223 and mag particle inspected, hard chrome plated. Carrier: billet machined from single piece of 8620 steel - integral keyed steel bolt carrier (machined as one piece to leave key in place). Heat treated per Mil-Spec.BARREL:  Barrel blanks are supplied by Rock Creek Barrels, Inc. and completed to final specification at Hogan Guns. Medium contour, hand lapped button twisted rifled, 6 fluted to improve rigidity and heat dissipation, reduce weight, improve accuracy by reducing barrel vibration when firing.  4150 Mil-B-11595 chrome moly vanadium alloy (machine gun rated). 70 Rockwell case hardened heat treated “5R” polygonal barrels are 2 times harder than Mil-Spec and hammer forged barrels.  Corrosion resistant and 10 times thicker and harder than Mil-Spec chromed lining. The treatment on the barrels causes zero imperfections and is extremely smooth which also enables the barrels to consistently achieve excellent accuracy.  Chamber: 5.56 x 45 mm NATO (.223 Cal) “5R” polygonal right handed 1x8 twist button rifled barrels. Hogan X-Brake 5 prong muzzle brake and collar nut, which is remarkably effective in recoil reduction but it does not suppress the flash. Made by Hogan Guns.NP3™ Plating:  NP3™ plating: combination of a nickel alloy plating combined with Polytetrafluoethylene (Teflon). NP3™ metal finish offers many benefits.  NP3 permits firing for longer periods of time between cleaning, dirt and powder residue have no wet or oily surface to cling to.  When cleaning is required, the effort needed is minimal - usually requiring only a soft cloth. CERAKOTE™:  With a unique ceramic backbone, Cerakote™ firearm coatings improve performance and reliability over conventional finishes.  This state-of-the-art coating technology out-performs any competitive coating in both laboratory settings and real world applications.HOGAN SPECIFICATIONS:  Smaller parts like springs, screws and washers are sourced from domestic manufacturers.  Everything in a HOGAN gun is 100% made in the U.S.A. All raw materials are manufactured from U.S. steel mills.  All heat treats, plating/coatings, are completed by U.S. owned and operated manufactures.  All accessory and component parts on weapon systems are from U.S. owned and operated manufacturers.  All HOGAN weapon systems are 100% pure American made."

The sights are the Wilsom Combat Vicker's gold bead front sight. The gun also of course comes with the well sought after RTF2 Frame and two standard glock mags. Also comes with a Concealment Express IWB kydex holster with adjustable cant. I have fired about 500 rounds through it. Well taken care of, cleaned and lubed with Ballistol after every range trip. Because it was my carry gun on and off for 5 months, it has some slide wear and the front corners. A little wear on the hood of the barrell, but nothing on the barrel. If interested, please shoot me an email and I can sent you more pictures. Other than that, the gun is stock and just as it came from the gun store.I'm asking $600 which is a fantastic deal seeing as a new Gen 3 Glock 19 goes for about $500 and the sights alone are priced at over $100 not including installation. The Gold bead front sight for the 19/17 isnt even sold any more. If you know what an RTF2 frame is, then you know why this just makes it an even sweeter deal. Reason for selling is the RTF2 frame is just too rough on my skin for my IWB carry. I tried putting a bit of Talon Grips on it but when it gets warm, it just slides off. No trades. Let me know if you have any questions. Buyer pays FFL.obo. shoot me an offer.No shipping.Am usually in Portland on the weekends."
