Both are real JM's made by the experts on lever rifles before Remington brought down the quality level. They are BLUE with CHECKERED AMERICAN BLACK WALNUT STRAIGHT STOCKS, FACTORY RECOIL PADS, and sling studs. The boxes were lost during our move in Y2K. The 45-70 is unfired and priced at $850 and the short .44 Mag has had a few rounds through it although it doesn't show it and is $900 because the whole family can handle it. I don't do pictures of any kind, low tech retiree so available for local cash sale only. No shipping, trades or B.S. offers. If you settle for less than a real Marlin, I have a box of Magtech 44's made specifically for cowboy action lever guns for $35. You'll probably need them for Re-marlins, Rossi, Puma, Winchester 1892's and clones. If you got a Henry with the goofy magazine tube copied off a marlin .22, good luck. ***For a response, LIST A PHONE NUMBER, I don't text, thanks.*** If you don't know the difference between REAL and NEW marlins, real ones have serial # on the tang and RE-marlins have it on the side of the reciever with ""MR"" in front of the ser. #. In Ohio it's hard to give away a 30-30 and most buyers walk away from Re-marlins."

There is slight rust on gas block & barrel that can easily be fixed, I just haven't taken the time. It also comes with 8 brand new 20 round plastic mags and 1-10 round metal mag that I used all the time.  The separate rail in the picture is for the ATI stock and it mounts to the scope ring notches on the receiver to attach any Picatinny style rings or accessories. It also has a rubber recoil bushing between the gas block and the receiver so the metal gas block doesn't slam against the metal receiver when fired, and also cut down significantly on the recoil. I'd really like to sell it but I don't have to, so please no low-ball offers."

The only reason I am selling it is because I bought me a nice 30-30 lever action, that I can only afford to keep if I sell a couple of other guns.  If could keep it , I would, believe me.  The Papoose is arguably the best option for a survival rifle out there, and these old wooden stocked ones are getting harder and harder to find these days.The bore on this gun is like brand new, and it has the classic micro-groove rifling that Marlin is famous for. It comes with the factory 7 round mag, plus 2 new 25 round Pro-Mag mags. For face to face transfers, the magazines will be loaded when you get them!  If it is sent through the mail, I am sorry, but I cannot legally send the gun with any ammunition in the package, so the mags will not be loaded.If you are interested, I can email you pics.

The only con is that the barrel's exposed end section past the forearm has been painted at some time to maybe cover some blemishes or scuffs but was done very nicely. I'm certain it could be easily removed but I'm not attempting to do so since it doesn't look bad at all. Overall an excellent condition 50 year old piece of Remington history!

Grips are are the correct second style used on Type III pistols.  Details are original right down to the circled rampant colt logo on the left rear of slide.  The barrel is clean and shiny with no rust, and the pistol functions flawlessly.These pistol is a 104 year old part of history that will make for interesting conversation among those that appreciate collectible firearms, and likely won't depreciate in value.Out of state shipment must be to a licensed FFL for an additional $35.  Cash or money order payment only, NO TRADES !  Sale must comply with all state and federal firearms purchase and shipping requirements."
