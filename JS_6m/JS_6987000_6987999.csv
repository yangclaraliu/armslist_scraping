T3x Compact tactical rifle is a multipurpose rifle that adapts to any given situation. The Tikka T3x Compact Tactical Rifle features a 10-round steel magazine and comes standard with vertical angled grop for prone shooting. Modular Stock:  T3x has a new modular synthetic stock that has interchangeable pistol grips, making it possible to modify the angle of the grip. This allows for multiple shooting positions. Additional grips are sold separately. The T3x synthetic stock also has an additional attachment point which allows you to change the width of the stock's fore-end.  Improved Grip:  A grip that never slips. The T3x synthetic stock has a new asymmetrical grip pattern and shape that has been specifically designed to give a solid grip in all conditions.  New Recoil Pad:  T3x models comes with a new recoil pad technology that reduces the impact of recoil on the shooter. The new robust pad allows you to fully concentrate on the accuracy of your shots.  Stock Noise Reduction:  Be as silent as the forest. T3x synthetic stocks now have a form insert within the interior of the rear stock - this lowers the stock - generated noise and can help you keep your target in sight. Not available for models with an adjustable cheek piece.  Redesigned Ejection Port:  The new T3x receiver introduces a widened angular ejection port that mkes it easier to feed one cartridge at a time.  Improved Rail Attachment:  Always keep the target in your sight. The T3x models have extra screw placements on top of the receiver so that you can robustly attach a picatinny rail - even when using larger scopes.  Metallic Bolt Shroud:  Robustness and quality go hand in hand. Metallic bolt shroud covers and shields the rear of the bolt body and the firing pin.  Steel Recoil Lug:  This extra-strong lug has minimal deformation - even with larger calibers. Compared to aluminum, the steel lug doesn't have strong imprinting qualities that would cause deformation when larger calibers are used.  Specifications:  Caliber: 6.5 Creedmoor Magazine Capacity: 10 Rds Finish: Blued Steel Trigger Group: Standard Trigger Barrel Length: 20"" Total Length: 40.2"""

Much like M-24, the barrel is cold hammer forged and features 5-R rifling. The 5R rifling profile increases barrel life expectancy, accuracy and creates less fouling and bullet deformation over time Whether you're a benchrest shooter or longtime, look no further for better reliability and precision. Why 5-R? 5-R rifling is the same type of rifiling used on the battle proven M-24 SWS. There are 5 lands as opposed to the normal 6 land configuration. Traditional lands are squared off at a 90 degree angle to the groove while the lands on 5-R rifling are tapered at 110 degrees which results in less bullet deformation. Also, none of the lands are directly across from one another. Both of these features lead to better accuracy and less fouling.  Legendary Model 700 Stainless Steel Action featuring the ""3-Rings of Steel"" makes this the strongest action on the market. 5-R hammer-forged with tactical/target-style rifling like that used in famous M-24 military rifles for the utmost in shot-to-shot consistency. 5-R increases barrel life and accuracy, causes less friction and bullet deformation. H.S. Precision composite stock features full-length aluminum bedding blocks for enhanced stability and shot-to-shot consistency.

Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP SK pistols are compatible with proven full size VP and P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity are available. A superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs but the VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. HK barrels on 9mm pistols have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy Made in the Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany.

As I said, it is in a sealed box. The attached pics are for reference only. Its the same rifle, I just haven't been able to bring myself to break the seal on mine yet. If I get a serious buyer, with cash in hand, I will meet them and cut the seal. If the rifle is not in pristine shape, I won't hold the buyer to the deal. I can ship this rifle as well, at the buyers expense. I would open and send pics prior to shipping. Sorry about being weird about it, but it's not often you have a gun remain untouched or opened or the action worked for 33 years.

Would make a great gift for a scout or eagle scout.

It has a standard military mil-dot reticle, and the turrets track exactly as they should and return to zero every time. The glass is extremely clear as well.  The only thing that isn't included from what you see in the pix are the AI magazine and the Harris bipod.  The magpul rail section and forward grip you see in the pix are all yours.The cost breakdown is as follows:  Savage rifle $470, Chassis system $500, Luth Stock $140, SWFA Scope $300, Scope mount $80.  TOTAL - $1490It was fun building and shooting for some time (I put about 250 rounds thru it), but I'm building something new, so I'm selling it for $1,000 flat.  Fixed, and sorry no trades."

The High Tower Armory 90/22 is a compact, maneuverable stock kit for the Ruger® 10/22® which utilizes a fully ambidextrous bullpup design for superior balance and ergonomics. This incredibly durable, military grade polymer stock will reduce the overall length of most 10/22’s to about 26 1/2 inches, just over the federally required minimum length for rifles. The HTA 90/22 also features a CNC machined monolithic aluminum Picatinny optics rail and aluminum bedding block, as well as an ambidextrous steel charging handle which cycles the factory 10/22 bolt from forward positions. The HTA 90/22 trigger linkage is made of Melonite treated steel for the most consistent and efficient transfer of energy, having a resistance to flex three times greater than aluminum by weight. A safety extension is included to allow the original factory safety to be activated, in addition to a safety selector located near the trigger. Also included is both an extended magazine and automatic bolt release which replace the factory releases and allow for much faster manipulation of your rifle's controls. Additionally, a shell deflector can be attached to the stock making it safe and comfortable to shoot left handed. This kit comes complete with a removable dummy suppressor, two side mounted Picatinny rails, and a detachable ammunition storage box for holding spare rounds in the field. Accepts factory 10 round magazines as well as most aftermarket high capacity magazines. Fits factory 18 1/2"" and .920"" bull barrels at least 18 inches in length (17 1/4 inches from receiver face to muzzle). Made in the USA. *Ruger 10/22 not included."

Been in his closet since it came in.. his health started going down hill for the past four years and now, he can't even carry it. Need to sell to help cover medical expenses. Has 20 rounds to be included. Still new and in perfect condition! Comes from factory preset at 1,500 yards. Factory rails for scope, by-pod. Adjustable chin rest.. this is a nice rifle.
