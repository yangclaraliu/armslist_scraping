This particular one was manufactured in January 2014 and has been gently used. The SR22 has virtually no recoil and is just a lot of fun at the range for beginners and more experienced shooters, as well. Upgrades:- Fiber Optic Front Sight, which is terrific and makes target acquisition super easy.- Stainlesss steel guide rod, which is more sturdy than the standard plastic guide rod, plus it looks nicer (original also included in the box).Also Included:- Original Ruger cardboard box.- Ruger zippered soft case.- Original Ruger gun lock.- Extra grip (smaller than one installed).- Three 10-round magazines.- Two pinky extender plates, and three flat base plates.- Original Ruger factory test casing.- Ruger sticker.- 50 rounds of CCI .22 LR Stinger 32 grain Varmint ammo.Gun features:- DA/SA trigger.- Semi-automatic.- Blowback operated.- Ambidextrous safety.- Hammer fired (very reliable).- Mini-picatinny rail.- Weighs only 17.5 ounces.
Asking $350, which seems fair, given upgrades and included ammo; but I'll consider reasonable offers. LOCAL SALES ONLY. MUST BE ABLE TO MEET FACE TO FACE IN THE TRIANGLE. Cash or certified funds only, although I will consider trades if you have something particularly interesting. You must have a concealed carry permit or valid pistol purchase permit.

Very nicely designed and built. Very sturdy - an average sized person could sit or stand on it with no risk of damage.  $250 cash and carry, either at a mutually agreed upon spot in the north end (near Northgate) or at West Coast Armory factoria where I shoot.  Pictures now added - gun and ammo shown for scale only and are not included or for sale. Two pics demonstrate how the four pistol padded rack pivots vertical (barrel pointed downward) to close the box, and opens to horizontal with handles pointed toward you.   If this ad is up, it is still available.  If you have questions beyond that, don't hesitate to ask.  I'd prefer a local number to message to in order to keep communications prompt, so if you are are interested, please provide a cell number that I can message you at."

This is number 228 of only 500 rifles manufactured in 1990/1991 to commemorate the 700th anniversary of the Swiss Confederation by the Association of Swiss Gunsmiths. These rifles were made using ex-military 7.5mm K.31 Short Rifles and sleeving the barrels to .22 caliber. A fixed, semi-cylindrical loading tray (and an offset rimfire firing pin) was added to the original, matching numbered bolt, and this fits into a corresponding recess surrounding the chamber mouth and allows the cartridge to be positioned correctly for loading. The metal retains 99% plus of its original mixture of bright blue on the barrel and matte black on the receiver with gold highlighted Swiss shield, “Jubilaums” on the left side, “KK-Karabiner” on the right. The bolt retains its original bright finish with satin textured finish on the aluminum knob, and the original matching numbered magazine is still present. The select, straight grain walnut stock and handguard are also in virtually pristine condition with almost no handling marks or blemishes marring the beautiful semi-gloss finish and the inset oval plaque on the right side has no chipping or damage around the inletting. The rifle still has its original 10 shot/50m test target in a sealed plastic hang tag, the original woven leather sling, which is in excellent, virtually unused condition, is also included. An original metal muzzle cover completes the package. These are absolutely splendid rifles that are seldom seen on the market today, especially in the U.S. and this example is in virtually new condition and exhibits practically no use."

(2 3/4”), 32” single barrel with an excellent, bright bore; 30” O/U barrels with excellent, bright bores. This is an excellent, modern trap gun that features: adjustable ribs with mid-beads on both barrel sets, extensively engraved frame with gold game bird inlays, single release trigger (installed by Phillip Crenwelge of Albert Lea, MN), hooked pistol grip with palm-swell, and adjustable comb.

The highly figured European walnut forend has a few very minor handling marks with some mild flattening of the points as well. The buttstock, likewise, has scattered small handling marks with a small triangular chip missing from the wood at the top of the right sideplate, and some further flattening of the points in a few spots. The stock has a 14 7/8” LOP to a black, Caesar Guerini recoil pad. Lock-up is still tight with both barrel sets, and the lever is still well right of center.
