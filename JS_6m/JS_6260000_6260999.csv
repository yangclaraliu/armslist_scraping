In fact, TFB’s own Miles V. will soon be receiving a test and evaluation unit for an in depth review.One of the AK-9’s biggest selling points, besides the price, is the optional magazine well adapter that allows the use of Glock 17/19/26 mags. The adapter is sold through a few online retailers for about $30.IMG_4905Credit: IntoWeapons IMG_4907Credit: IntoWeaponsAlthough the pistol itself is being imported into the U.S, by Chiappa, the gun itself is reported to be made by the Cugir Arms Factory in Romania. Cugir, who also manufactures the popular semiautomatic AKM WASR rifle, falls under the state-owned ROMARMS defense company headquartered in Bucharest, Romania.Some initial internet reviews complained of failures to feed, but like anything in this world, seeing is believing. As such, I’m looking forward to Miles’ putting the Chiappa AK-9 through its paces.Chiappa  From the Chiappa PAK-9 Product Page:Chiappa Firearms harnesses the fun and functionality of the legendary AK rifle in the form of an easy to shoot 9mm pistol the PAK-9 respectively.

The VP9 was developed by Heckler & Koch to meet the need for a safe, robust, ergonomically enhanced, striker fired handgun.
Easily identify whether the firing pin is in the cocked or uncocked mode. Quickly view the amount of ammunition present. With slide releases present on both sides of the frame and a magazine release on the rear, bottom portion of the trigger guard, VP9 controls are completely ambidextrous.
The VP9’s high strength polymer frame includes a unique ergonomic handgun grip design consisting of interchangeable grip panels and backstraps, as well as a dustcover with a standard Picatinny rail interface. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting.
The barrel — made from canon grade steel — ensures long service life.  The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.
The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.
The extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into the VP9’s polymer frame can mount a wide variety of lights, laser aimers, and other accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.
The VP9 is well suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products"

Nearly identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound less due to its forged aluminum frame, making it more comfortable for everyday carry. Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no manual safety lever, the relatively longer and heavier first round trigger pull requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. There is a safety stop on the hammer as well as a firing pin block safety. It has snag-free, fixed 3-dot sights. Other features of the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps, and a loaded chamber indicator.
