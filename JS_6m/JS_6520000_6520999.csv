Comes with scope, 6 boxes of ammo and a strap. Here is a little bit about the gun...Ruger Mini 14 is a well built and well made gun. It does exactly what it’s advertised as. It’s a ranch rifle, a field gun, a reliable little buddy that will go into the bush with you and come out none worse for the wear.It’s not a tack driver. It never was a tack driver. For anyone who buys this thing and then is upset they can’t hit the middle of the target at 1000 yards probably shouldn’t be buying guns at all. The Ruger Mini 14 is called a ranch gun for a reason. It’s made to be a low maintenance reliable gun that you carry around with you in your pick up truck around the farm in case some varmints need killing. From what I’ve read, the mini isn’t as accurate as an AR-15 but it’s a lot less expensive and apparently more reliable. Reliable in that you don’t need to clean it as meticulously to maintain that reliability. I’m sure that will cause arguments from the die hard AR people, but if it’s true than that makes the mini 14 a better TSHTF gun....Price isn't form but there is a minimum. Message me for any more details regarding the gun, and it interested in looking at it. 18+ and VT ID required, along with VT Bill of sale."

Unlike earlier Webley Mark revolvers, the Mark VI featured a square-butt grip and a dull finish that was less reflective than the blued finish previously seen on the firm's military sidearms. Many commercially-produced Webleys were manufactured as well, and these differ in their lack of military property marks and in the presence of commercial proofs. British government production of the Mark VI began in 1921 at the Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield Lock after cancellation of cancellation of the Webley & Scott contracts, and, with the exception of external markings, these models were identical to the Webley-manufactured examples. The rugged Mark VI saw action in the hands of British troops through two World Wars, from the trenches of the Western Front to the beaches of Dunkirk and Normandy, the drive across North Africa, up the Italian boot, and through France and Germany, and as well as in the jungles of the Pacific.  775.00"

If you're interested in buying these firearms outright I will sell them TOGETHER (no separate sales) for the price of $700. That's a little less that what I payed for the scope, and both rifles. If you're interested in trying to work out a trade deal for BOTH rifles, then the trade value needs to be around $780 which includes the value of the two rifles, the scope, and the ammo to go with them both. I'm specifically looking for a Glock 30S, but am willing to consider practically any Glock on the market except the extra long models. I am very partial to .45 acp firearms, so if you have other manufacturers besides Glock, then let me know and the worst I can say is no. Thanks for looking, and shoot me a text if you have any questions. Six 1 FIVE, 9 Three nine, 66 Two 9."
