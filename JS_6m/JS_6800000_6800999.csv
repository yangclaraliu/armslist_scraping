Our Guardian has proven so popular due to its concealable profile and Commander-length slide that we took it a step further with the CCO the Concealed Carry Officer a Commander slide on an Officer frame. With the proven stopping power of the .45 ACP and 7+1 capacity, you won't be under-gunned. To make it disappear more easily while carrying concealed, we bobbed the back of the mainspring housing. To reduce overall weight, the frame and mainspring housing are made from anodized aluminum. We included an undercut trigger guard and our ?chain-link? grip treatment on the front strap and mainspring housing to help control recoil and give it a distinctive look.
The slide and small parts are treated in the same Duty Black finish that we use on all of our black guns. We fitted dual-colored tritium lamps for faster low-light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration.
The CCO uses a medium-length trigger to facilitate faster draws and better fit in the hand. The gun is rounded out with our stippled shadow grips. Like all Dan Wesson models, this gun is both beautiful and functional."

This pistol is the full size version with 5” barrel w/full-length guide rod. It has the extended ambidextrous thumb safety, extended slide stop, with a lowered and flared ejection port. With the skeletonized hammer and trigger and the extended Beavertail grip safety this gun is a beauty!!
Comes with three 8-round magazines (2 Rock Island and 1 after market Act Mag). Includes a pair of plastic “skull” grips if desired as well as the original grips along with the original Citadel case. I have 23 rounds of .45ACP MagTech that I will include as well.
This pistol is the start of “thinning the herd” a little bit so will probably be selling a few other firearms in the not too distant future too. For that reason I am not interested in any trades right now:)
Transaction requires a Bill of Sale (I will bring two copies so each of us will have a copy) so will require being a Florida resident and have photo ID or CCW.
If any questions of course let me know!!

The .40 S&W recoil in a carbine is less than a .223 Remington.  So this would also be a good bedroom companion for a lady that is recoil sensitive.  It also shoots pretty flat, even a little flatter than my .44 Magnum Winchester rife.  $625 for the rifleMay be interested in trades for Swiss K31, Finnish M39, Makarov, Ruger Bisley in .44 Mag and perhaps others.

I also have a Beretta PX4 Storm pistol in the same powerful .40 cal. round, with both guns using the same 14 round interchangable mags. If you are looking for the ultimate ""BUG OUT"" combo to carry, this is it. With open sights the Beretta CX4 Storm Carbine is deadly with a big punch from 125 yards in. It also has the “Bad Axx” look with the after market faux 'FS' flash suppressor. The 'FS' also helps protect your hands from a hot barrel. Converts from right hand to left hand ejection and safety in minutes.
The Beretta PX4 Storm .40 cal. pistol with “Night Sights” and rotating barrel is not only extremely accurate, but has much less felt recoil by design, than other .40 cal pistols, and it uses the same mags as the Carbine, so you will never be without the proper mag. Get yourself a good tactical vest, and you are ready for the “Zombie Apocolypse.” SA/DA with hammer release for the pistol.
Comes totally with 5 mags, hard case for the carbine and factory Beretta case for the pistol.
Will consider selling the Carbine by itself first at $525 (w/o fake suppressor) with (2) mags and then sell the Beretta PX4 Storm pistol with factory case and (3) mags for $475. Call for a great COMBO price?
Call or email for the COMBO price. Both guns are LNIB and fired at range with a box of shells through each to test for 100% reliability. I'm a private gun owner, and will require a Bill Of Sale to an Alabama resident of legal age.Note: $525 price is for Carbine only, w/o the 'FS' which cost me over $100 just by itself. I can always use it on other guns, but it really gives the Carbine that CQC look. If 'FS' bought with carbine add $100.If you see the ad, it means it is avaiable, so don't ask, and no TEXT."

Micro slides are made to the tightest allowable tolerances, with barrels machined from stainless steel for superior resistance to moisture. All Micro frames are shaped from the finest aluminum for integrity and strength. In many respects a miniature 1911, among the most important Micro design advantages is a single action trigger with the kind of short, smooth pull that ensures accuracy and builds confidence. The thumb safety, slide release and magazine release are pure 1911 as well. Standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Sights are steel – not plastic – and mounted in machined dovetails for additional integrity. Each Micro includes a flush-fitting 6-round magazine and an extended 7-round magazine is available as an accessory.
 
Ideal for shooters with small hands as well as those who insist on mild recoil combined with enough power for concealed carry or home protection, Micro pistols are the right choice for many applications. Best of all, they offer unequaled Kimber quality, dependability and performance.

Blackhawk/Knoxx Spec Ops Stock Gen II w/ Powerpak (Used): I am selling these items together.  I originally put this on my personal shotgun but could never acclimate myself to the pistol grip.  It does a wonderful job of mitigating the recoil of 2.75 inch 00 Buck loads.  I put approximately 75-80 rounds through my shotgun with the stock attached.  Aside from my personal preference, I have not had any issues.  Also, the Powerpak will come with all of the necessary tools for changing out the cheekpieces and accessories.  The buyer will need to purchase or procure a stock wrench as I do not have one for sale.  The manuals will also be sent with the items.  Price: $85.002. Aluminum Railed Forend (Used): I purchased this item several years ago thinking it would be an interesting accessory.  (Unfortunately, I do not recall the manufacturer's name.)  Interesting it is, but for a very particular end-user.  I am a traditionalist and prefer more of the old-fashioned ""corn cobb"" or ""police style"".  This particular item works well if one intends to put a pistol grip on the stock and forend of the 870.  Plus it has a certain ""cool-factor"" that some will enjoy.  Price: $35.00 (Not Pictured)3. Hogue 870 Supercell Recoil Pad for Synthetic Stocks (New): I actually ordered this one by mistake.  I had believed I was purchasing a recoil pad for my Mossberg 500 and apparently didn't pay attention as I checked out of the website.  And it was also with some chagrin that I realized, after having destroyed the packaging with my pocket knife, that it was designed for easier opening.  It has never been ground, glued, or attached to any firearm.  Price: $5.00 (Not Pictured)4. Remington 870 Police Synthetic Stock and Forend (New): This was a deal I found on closeout.  At one point in time I had two of these, along with a similar number of stock sets for the Benelli M4.  This particular set has only been fitted to a firearm, but has never been used during a firing session, hence the ""New"" classification.  Perhaps ""New-ish"" might be a better term.  Either way, it is still in excellent condition.  Price $35.005. Surefire 6V 870 Weaponlight (Used): This was another item that once adorned my personal shotgun.  The light is a bright and hearty LED that will light up any room or space.  Definitely a good fit for home protection or ""spec-ing"" out a bugout firearm.  This particular part is considered either a second or third generation weaponlight.  It has a beefier grip, as opposed to the newer, slimmer offerings from Surefire.  Since I have shorter, stubbier fingers, I could not attain a proper grip that I considered safe and comfortable.  So, again, aside from my personal preference, this item works very well and has no issues.  It does have the constant on-off switch on the left and the pressure switch on the right.  I will sell/ship it with two CR123As.  PLEASE NOTE that since it is a 6V model it will not sit flush with a 14-inch SBS.  I believe you can cut the barrel down to about 16 inches, give or take, in order for it to sit flush.  Price: $125.00"

This rifle has had the stock professionally refinished while I owned it, with GB Linspeed oil; the blue finish of the metal is excellent with very little edge wear, no rust, no freckling, it came to me in that condition, I don't know, but suspect, it was professionally re-blued at some time. Best estimate I can find for manufacture date is 1928. It has claw-mount scope bases installed, but it had no scope or mounts when I got it. The claw mount bases are intact, and I made a custom set of bases, utilizing a Weaver QD top mount in front, drilling and tapping the (removable) front claw mount base, which is inletted into the receiver top. In other words, a custom claw mount could be obtained, e.g. NECG, though they are pricy. The scope is a Weaver 1-3 1"" variable with duplex reticle, about right for this rifle, noted for withstanding heavy recoil, quick acquisition and long eye relief, and the scope is clear. Standard iron sights are in place, 100 and 300 meter blades. Safety is the Mauser-type wing safety, which can be manipulated under the scope bell. Double set trigger functions and adjusts as designed. Length of pull to the front (normal) trigger is 13-1/2"", with the thin rifle pad installed. A longer length of pull would be had by fitting s thicker recoil pad. This stock length fit me fine with winter clothing worn. Barrel length is 20 inches. Overall an attractive rifle, in a hard-hitting woods or field caliber. I have hunted with this rifle some, there are a few light marks visible, nothing serious, and they are shown in the pictures. The 9.5x57 M-S was initially designed for Africa, but was not quite up to the dangerous game, but very effective for lion and other soft-skinned species. The bore is excellent, mirror bright with sharp lands and grooves. Factory ammo for this rifle is not currently available, so it is a hand-loading proposition. I am including a full die set to roll your own: C-H forming neck expanding die, full-length resizing and seating/crimping die set, a neck sizing and decapping die and a Lyman ""M"" die which bells the case mouth slightly for accepting cast bullets without shaving. Dies use the same shell holder die as the 8x57, .30-06, .308, etc. There are 47 twice-fired cases included, which have been fireformed and are ready to reload by decapping, priming, neck sizing, powder and bullet seating. Also included approx. 48 new R-P 8x57 Mauser brass cases, which I use to form the 9.5x57. One pass with the lubed expanding neck-forming die, then I would load a light cast bullet load with the bullet just touching the lands to fireform (otherwise the headspace is just a bit long for uniform ignition). Sounds a bit complex, but for any experienced reloader it is easy. Also, 90 Speer .375 diameter hot-core 235 grain semi-pointed bullets, which feed very well from the magazine, shoot quite accurately, and hit game like the hammer of Thor. The round was designed for a 270 grain round-nosed bullet, but these have mostly disappeared from production, and spitzer and spire points don't seem to feed very well. Note this is a controlled-round feed, just like the Mausers, and cartridges should come up under the claw extractor from the magazine well. I CAN SHIP FOR $30 TO ANY SERIOUS BUYER"

I eventually got to take it to the gun range and really liked how it felt and how accurately it shot. I also liked the trigger, although it was lighter and with a shorter reset than I had experienced on any of my previous semi-automatic pistols.I did have some light primer strikes, which I did not like. I took it back out to the range a few days later and had some additional light primer strikes. I contacted the Bersa distributor and they responded immediately. They were very helpful and provided an authorized warranty center contact. I called them and explained the issue of light primer strikes. The gunsmith asked me for the serial number and, as I started reading it to him, told me that those serial numbers came with a different firing pin and spring than the later serial numbers.The gunsmith told me to send the gun to him and he would replace those parts, inspect and ensure the gun is fully functional, and clean and return it to me. I received the gun back last week and they had replaced the firing pin and spring. I had a chance to take it to the range late yesterday afternoon and put 100 rounds of a combination of Federal and Perfecta FMJ 115 grain ammo through the gun. I didn't have a single light primer strike or any other issue.This Bersa doesn't have a safety and I don't believe at this time I will be carrying a conceal gun without one (just a personal choice) so I am selling it. It does have a internal locking system on the right side of the slide operated by the included Bersa key that enables you to prevent the gun from firing if you prefer for household safety, but I never had a need to utilize that feature.Sale includes everything you see in the pictures, plus assorted parts the distributor sent me at my request in lieu of reimbursing me for shipping charges to the gunsmith. Those parts include a new firing pin assembly and recoil spring guide assembly. This is a great price on a really nice single-stack 9mm.""Must be able to complete at this time a local face-to-face cash sale. Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID. No exceptions."""
