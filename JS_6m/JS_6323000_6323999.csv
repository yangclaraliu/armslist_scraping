$960 firm in cash or better in trade value.  Lots of trade offers so far, but nothing I'd rather have yet over this one yet.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  Please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??  If you don't mention cash or other either way, I will assume you want a straight trade.
Mostly interested in semi-autos, will consider others, depending.  Stripped lowers, nice AR/AK triggers, quality lightweight 12""-15"" AR rail and 12""+/- AR-10 rail.  FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 triggers.

The 455 model will eventually consolidate all of the receivers currently used in the 452 line into one common platform. This combined with the new interchangeable barrel system of the CZ 455 will allow the user to easily change the stock configuration as well as the caliber of the rifle. The 455 retains the accuracy and quality of the adjustable trigger, hammer forged barrel and billet machined receiver from the CZ 452. Improvements that the 455 brings include new manufacturing technology and tighter tolerances for improved accuracy and smoother operation. The FS version of the 455 is similar to the CZ 455 Lux except the stock is patterned after the full length, Mannlicher style. A 5 round magazine is included."

Building on the lauded submachinegun platform that first hit the US civilian market in pistol form in 2015, the Carbine has a 16.2″ barrel fitted with either a compensating muzzle brake or a faux suppressor built specifically for CZ-USA by SilencerCo. Fit with the factory’s folding adjustable stock, the Carbine features a number of US-made parts to make it fully 922(r) compliant. One of the nicest features of the firearm is the newly-designed forend, covered in M-LOK attachment points to keep the profile slim while still being big enough to swallow most pistol-caliber suppressors should the owner decide down the road to convert it into an SBR for use with a suppressor. Low-profile aluminum adjustable sights round out the platform, and a top Picatinny rail allows the mounting of a wide number of optics. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.   Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.Buy it online at www.copsgunshop.net.           SPECIFICATIONS   CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Carbine w/ Faux Suppressor        Product Name  CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Carbine w/ Faux Suppressor   SKU  08507   Firearm Type  Rifle   Purpose  Home Defense   MSRP  $1,049.00   Chambering  9mm Luger   Magazine Capacity  20+1   Magazine Type  Double stack polymer   Frame  Fiber-reinforced polymer   Grips  Polymer, adjustable for reach to trigger   Trigger Mech  SA   Sights  Low-profile fully adjustable aperture and post, 4 rear aperture sizes   Barrel  Cold hammer forged, muzzle threaded 1/2x28   Barrel Length  16.2   Weight  7 lbs   Overall Length  34.75 in / 24.5 in   Height  9.4 in   Safety  Ambidextrous thumb safety"

Like all IWI firearms, it was developed in close cooperation with elite units of the Israel Defense Force, tailored to their specific requirements and needs. Taking cues from the Tavor TAR-21 issued to the IDF, the X95 continues the evolution of the modern bullpup CQB rifle. Slim and compact with a 16” barrel and an OAL of 26.1”, it is offered in 5.56 NATO, easily converted to 9mm Luger Parabellum and soon to .300 AAC. The X95 features STANAG magazine compatibility, forefinger ambidextrous magazine release, interchangeable pistol grip assemblies and a tri-rail forearm with removable rail covers for easily customizable accessory placement (flashlight, laser, vertical fore grip, bipod, etc.). Like its predecessor the TAR-21, the X95 is 100% ambidextrous to right or left hand operation with the optional opposite hand bolt."

It fits into a backpack carrying case. It's convertible and really lightweight, so everthing from the chair forward flips up and over to behind where you're sitting with the flick of your wrist. It's got a front doggie door flap you can leave unzipped so your dog can run out before you flip the cover over. The mesh netting is really easy to see through when you're inside it, but completely masks you from the outside.The wood furniture on the Mossberg is in good shape. The shotgun itself is in fair, previously-hunted-with shape. If you have cash, feel free to text me at REDACTED. Please don't text me with trade offers. Thank you."

This is M&P's answer to all the semi negatives from the old model that everyone complained about. The slide has been reduced significantly for weight reduction, the annoying beavertail was chopped off, the grip bore axis was raised to get a perfect recoil management, and the best thing, the trigger was completly re mastered! It is still a 2 peice trigger but all the internals have been redone to acheive a factory 5.2-5.7lb pull with a lot less pre travel, a very crisp break, a shorter reset, and a very audible reset click. The only thing this trigger needs is the apex enhanced trigger ($40) not the $180 kit! This one comes with the more agressive grip pattern as well as 4 back straps. Two magazines come with it from the factory. I have ordered all the needed goddies already. I have the Dawson Precision FO Comp sights already (brand new, installed $95), I have the elusive frame plug inserts to remove the thumb safety and plug the holes (factory plugs from S&W), an additional factory stock mag from S&W ($35), and yes the Apex trigger (brand new, installed $40). This M2.0 is a beautiful firearm and I would like to keep it but I was somehow lucky enough to come across a VTAC 9mm with a full Apex comp kit installed, 5 magazines, 2 holsters, and a tlr1 so I have no real need to continue to put any more money into this one to get it where I want it seeing how the VTAC is ready to go. I have $800 into everything listed and unfortunatly I know I cant get that back but im willing to take the hit on the accessories that I have bought and only because I got a $250 gift card for christmas and thats what I used (not my money lol). I need $580 for everything. which is the cost of the firearm alone $579.99 so you save the taxes, paperwork, plus you get the $200 worth of extras after shipping costs! I am open to trade offer but trade value must be closer to my cost $725 is fair and close enough for me, please see below. Thanks. REDACTED"

They sure don't make them like this one anymore.It has been a great shotgun but, I recently upgraded to a newer model and waited until I trusted it before I would offer this one. It has functioned perfectly for me and I have kept it working that way with parts as needed. I used it for many rounds of Skeet. Not very good at it but I still like the game.I will include one 26-inch barrel, fixed choke, Improved Cylinder and one 28-inch barrel, fixed choke, Modified. Uses 2-3/4 inch or shorter shells only with the included two barrels. Both barrels have a Brass Bead front sight. Receiver is Magnum Rated and this is NOT a 'Remlin' Also not the Light Weight Version.Maintenance Parts that I have changed out to keep her running right,- Magazine Spring and Spring Cap- Magazine Follower- Magazine Cap- O-Ring Barrel Seal- Stripped and Refinished Furniture with several fresh coats of Tung Oil for protectionused a non abrasive Stripping Solution (CitriStrip) so the wood would not be harmedThis old girl is ready to offer someone else years of enjoyment. New parts are readily available for this shotgun. Many parts from the newer model 11-87 are interchangeable with this shotgun and an upgraded synthetic stock would be easy to find if that is your taste. I like wood furniture as my preference."
