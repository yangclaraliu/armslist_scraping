 This is a RARE Remington Model Four in 7MM Express now known as 280 Remington. These Rifles were built between 1979-1981 to try to revamp the 280 Remington Caliber. It confused shooters with the 7MM Magnum so Remington changed the name back to 280 Remington so it wouldn't confuse anymore customers with the 7MM Magnum Cartridge. This Rifle shoots 280 Remington ammunition from it just fine as it should. The rifle is in very good shape and shows normal handling marks. This is the only one I have ever seen like it.

Finish: Daniel Defense Mil Spec + Cerakote Made in the USA!    Features:  CHF: Cold Hammer Forging is a barrel making process that produces the strongest, longest lasting, and most accurate barrels. Daniel Defense takes this process one step further by simultaneously forging the chamber and bore, resulting in perfect alignment and barrels that are smoother and free of defects. Flash Suppressor: Daniel Defense Flash Suppressor is designed to virtually eliminate muzzle flash, featuring compact size and lifetime durability. Manufactured from aerospace 17-4 stainless steel and salt bath nitride finished. Available in standard or extended length and 1/2""x28 TPI or 5/8""x24 TPI. Freefloat Rail: A freefloat rail moutns to the rifle via the barrel nut, eliminating any contact with the barrel. This ensures the harmonics of the barrel are not influenced by the weight of mounted accessories or the pressure from slings or shooting positions. This provides the M4/AR15 platform huge improvements in terms of repeatable accuracy and reduction in ""wandering"" point of impact. Bolt Up System (DDM4/AR15 LR III): DD's patented rail moutning system fastens the rail to the rifle's receiver providing unmatched durability in the field. Using 4 Grade 8 Mil-Spec fasteners, the rail and Bolt-Up Plate are clamped around, a hardened steel barrel nut. Tabs on the Bolt-Up Plate ensure alignment of the rail to the upper receiver during installation. Flared Magwell: DD's widened and beveled magwell funnels magazines into place for the fastest, most secure reloades possible. Buttstock: DD's custom designed buttstock is precision-molded from a proprietary blend of glass-infused polymers for unsurpassed strength and durability. It features soft-touch rubber overmolding for comfort, and ambidextrous limited-rotation QD attachment points. It comes complete with two buttpads to customize fit any shooter. QD Points: Integrated Quick Disconnect Points for the attachent of slings. MPI BCG: Magnetic Particle Inspection is a process that uses electrical current and magnetic particles to detect invisible defects within the surface of metals. Each and every bolt and carrier they manufacture undergoes this Military-required test, ensuring only the best, defect-free, components find their way into Daniel Defense rifles. Pistol Grip: DD's grip is made from a proprietary blend of glass-infused polymers for unsurpassed strength and durability. Comfort is assured by the soft-touch rubber overmolding combined with a more natural angle. The integrated flared trigger guard covers the gap between grip and lower receiver and easily accommodates a gloved hand. Cut and Polished Feedramps: DD's M4-profile feed ramps are precisely cut and polished for smooth, snag-free feeding of cartridges, ensuring reliability in both semi-automatic and fully-automatic fire.

The pics don't do this rifle justice...it's stunning. The barreled receiver is from James River Armory and features a forged receiver and bolt with a Criterion barrel.  The receiver is marked “Rockola M14” (as a tribute to the Rockola company that built Garands during WWII) The build was completed with 100% USGI op rod, trigger group, gas puck, and a beautiful figured birch stock, which was tastefully refinished to retain the history, proof mark and defense stamp (the grain on the grip is darker from being held by soldiers in the past…and that history has been retained). Springfield M1As are quality replicas of M14s, but they are made with investment castings to keep down cost and are not USGI spec. This is a true M14 built to 100% USGI specs. The trigger has been trued and polished, and breaks like glass at 4lbs 10oz (to remain legal for Camp Perry matches).  The sling is a 1903 leather adjustable swivel with brass hardware. The case is padded M1950 paratrooper’s case. Also comes with 3 USGI military issue 20 rd mags…2 still sealed in packaging (these are the best mags you can get…not cheap copies). The scope is a vortex 4-16X50 mounted on med height rings so the iron sights can still be used. This set up shoots 1MOA with match grade ammo. This is an awesome old-school tactical long range set up…sure there are lighter, more accurate modern rifles out there…but this has a cool factor that is unmatched. Cash value $1900. Do your research...It would cost @$2800 to reproduce this set-up

Finish: Daniel Defense Mil Spec + Cerakote Made in the USA!    Features:  CHF: Cold Hammer Forging is a barrel making process that produces the strongest, longest lasting, and most accurate barrels. Daniel Defense takes this process one step further by simultaneously forging the chamber and bore, resulting in perfect alignment and barrels that are smoother and free of defects. Flash Suppressor: Daniel Defense Flash Suppressor is designed to virtually eliminate muzzle flash, featuring compact size and lifetime durability. Manufactured from aerospace 17-4 stainless steel and salt bath nitride finished. Available in standard or extended length and 1/2""x28 TPI or 5/8""x24 TPI. Freefloat Rail: A freefloat rail moutns to the rifle via the barrel nut, eliminating any contact with the barrel. This ensures the harmonics of the barrel are not influenced by the weight of mounted accessories or the pressure from slings or shooting positions. This provides the M4/AR15 platform huge improvements in terms of repeatable accuracy and reduction in ""wandering"" point of impact. Bolt Up System (DDM4/AR15 LR III): DD's patented rail moutning system fastens the rail to the rifle's receiver providing unmatched durability in the field. Using 4 Grade 8 Mil-Spec fasteners, the rail and Bolt-Up Plate are clamped around, a hardened steel barrel nut. Tabs on the Bolt-Up Plate ensure alignment of the rail to the upper receiver during installation. Flared Magwell: DD's widened and beveled magwell funnels magazines into place for the fastest, most secure reloades possible. Buttstock: DD's custom designed buttstock is precision-molded from a proprietary blend of glass-infused polymers for unsurpassed strength and durability. It features soft-touch rubber overmolding for comfort, and ambidextrous limited-rotation QD attachment points. It comes complete with two buttpads to customize fit any shooter. QD Points: Integrated Quick Disconnect Points for the attachent of slings. MPI BCG: Magnetic Particle Inspection is a process that uses electrical current and magnetic particles to detect invisible defects within the surface of metals. Each and every bolt and carrier they manufacture undergoes this Military-required test, ensuring only the best, defect-free, components find their way into Daniel Defense rifles. Pistol Grip: DD's grip is made from a proprietary blend of glass-infused polymers for unsurpassed strength and durability. Comfort is assured by the soft-touch rubber overmolding combined with a more natural angle. The integrated flared trigger guard covers the gap between grip and lower receiver and easily accommodates a gloved hand. Cut and Polished Feedramps: DD's M4-profile feed ramps are precisely cut and polished for smooth, snag-free feeding of cartridges, ensuring reliability in both semi-automatic and fully-automatic fire.

KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding ""return-to-zero"" when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new Slim Rail 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15"" rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel while transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with their mid-length gas system, which is known to have a moother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3,6, and 9 o'clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4V11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16"" Government profile barrel and the new desgined, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.

Styled in the familiar AR configuration, it’s a no-nonsense rifle you can trust with anything—including your life.     This tough-as-nails rifle was designed specifically to answer the call for a low-maintenance, enhanced reliability carbine.     The REC7 rifle’s dependability stems largely from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts, the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean, reducing maintenance requirements and increasing endurance.     The patented chrome-lined fluted gas block prevents excessive carbon buildup from operation under adverse conditions. The one-piece 17-4 stainless piston transfers energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel, the carrier features an integral piston strike face.     The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high-strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7, not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt’s gas-ring-free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance.     At the heart of the operating system is a nitrided, two-position, forward-venting gas plug that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the front of the gas block without removing the handguard so optical sights or laser devices do not need to be zeroed after routine maintenance.     The REC7 rifle’s forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are Type 3 Class 2 hardcoat anodized and Cerakote finished. The lower houses an ultra-dependable single-stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated, hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrel with M4 feed ramps machined into the receiver and the barrel extension. A mil-spec A2 flash hider protects the muzzle.     In 5.56 NATO and 6.8 SPC, the REC7 is everything you’d expect from a Barrett rifle, and then some.   Specifications:  Model: Rec7 Caliber: 5.56mm Nato Barrel Length: 16"" (40.6 cm) Rifling Twist: 1:7"" (18 cm) Operation: Gas Piston System; Semi-Automatic or Select Fire Weight: 7.2 lbs (3.26 kg) Overall Length: 33.25"" (84.46 cm) Stock Types: Magpul MOE 6 Position Rail / Handguard Types: Barrett Enhanced Rail featuring Keymod"

Styled in the familiar AR configuration, it's a no-nonsense rifle you can trust with anything-including your life. This tough-as-nails rifle were designed specifically to anwswer the call for a low-maintenance, enhanced reliability carbine. The Rec7 rifle's dependability stems largely from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts, the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean, reducing maintenance requirements and increasing endurance.  The patented chrome-lined fluted gas block prevents excessive carbon buildup from operation under adverse conditions. The one-piece 17-4 stainless piston transfers energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel, the carrier features an integral piston strike face. The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high-strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated Rec7, not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt's gas-ring-free designed is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance. At the heart of the operating system is a nitrided, two-position, forward-venting gas plug that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the front of the gas block without removing the handguard so optical sights or laser devices do not need to be zeroed after routine maintenance.  The Rec7 rifle's forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are Type 2 Class 2 Hardcoat anodized and Cerakote finished. The lower houses an ultra-dependable single-stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated, hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrel with M4 feed ramps machined into the receiver and the barrel extension. A mil-spec A2 flash hider protects the muzzle.

Currently it is missing the front swivel, but I should have it somewhere and will put it back on.

If you would like to include these items the price will be $2350. That's about $400 less than retail, with very little use on them. I am a resident of Washington State, and as such I am legally required to complete the sale through an FFL. The rifle shoots very well, I have no complaints and in fact it is my buddie's favorite rifle he's ever shot. I've decided to sell it to fund a Surgeon build.

About $3500 total invested. As we all realize, you cannot get your money back on a gun like that... that's why it makes sense to buy a good one used...  This is the best shooting pistol that I have ever fired ( right up there with a Clark or a Shockey ). It is very controlable, thanks to the compensated barrel, and will stack the rounds one on top of the other thanks to the work of the gunsmith that built it. The trigger job is somewhere around 3 lbs, and it breaks like a glass rod...zero creep. Finish is a non reflecting matt blue, about 100% remaining. No idea on the number of rounds fired, but it can't have been many, judging from the look and tightness of the pistol.  The pistol comes with two matching magazines. If you would like to have a fast shooting, extreemly accurate, very controlable 1911 this is it for $1200 .  If you would rather spend $3500 and have it built for yourself, I understand that too. I might be interested in trades on GI 1911 pistols or GI M1 carbines and parts. Thanks for looking.Might be interested in trade of M1 carbine, carbine parts or USGI 1911S"

Pmag.  This is a new unfired rifle that I never got around to doing anything with because of other projects.  I chose this particular AR-10 because I wanted a bit more range than a 16"" barrel would give and the medium contour barrel keeps the rifle as light as possible without compromising accuracy.  After looking over lots of ballistic data I saw no reason to go with a 20"" barrel, IMO the gain in velocity was simply not worth the extra length and weight.  Again, the rifle is new but it was purchased around three years ago or so and just sat in the safe.  The only one I could find currently listed was one on Gunbroker for $1,650 in the same stock configuration.  I do have aftermarket pistol grips and stocks I can add for a little extra, just let me know.
$1,360 firm in cash or will look at good trade offers.  This one cost well over $1,500 after tax and it's new. 
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and shorter in 9mm and .45 ACP and cash or??  Might also look at a Glock 19, maybe 17 with factory Glock 15rd. to 30+ round mags, prefer a Gen 4 with bright night sights, but will look at Gen 3's too.  Not looking for one that has been ""customized"", except maybe a trigger improvement.  If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.
Must be able to own a firearm in TX.  I can ship insured to another TX resident for $30 more.
Thanks for looking!"

Don't sacrifice familiarity, speed, or accuracy when you need long range or high energy performance. Like th P415, the P308 features all of their Gen4 upgrades such as E2 Extraction Technology, ambidextrous fire controls, modular free floating rail platform, anti-tilit buffer tube, anti-tilt buffer tube, their M-LOK compatible M Rail, and more. The P308 is your best option for certainty in an uncertain world. Specifications:  Caliber: 7.62x51mm Nato Barrel: 16.5"" (1:10) Rail Length: 11.5"" M-Rail Weight: 8.1lbs-8.5lbs Length: 34""-39.5"" (collapsed) Trigger: Standard Drop-IN 4.5lb  Proprietary Technology & Features:  Gen4 Lower Receiver E2 Dual-Extraction Technology: POF's patented E2 dual-extraction technology consists of four small channels cut into the walls of the chamber allowing a small amount of gas pressure to push against the neck of the spent case. This pressure assists in extraction by breaking the seal between the chamber and case as well as pushing the spent case to the rear as the extractor is pulling to the rear. This removes a tremendous amount of work that would otherwise be left up to the extractor. Nitride Heat-Treated Barrel: Proper gas regulation and lubricated mechanics are nothing without the precision and durability of a quality barrel. POF's chrome alloy barrels are machined for absolute accuracy. POF's barrels are nitride heat-treated for full corrosion resistance. Triple Port Muzzle Brake: Designed to precisely compliment the POF platform their nitride heat-treated muzzle brake controls gas dispersion and reduces muzzle rise. It is effective in allowing the shooter to have faster follow up shots and has unbelievably soft felt recoil. It features blunt strike prongs and includes their nitride heat-treated collar jam nut. Oversized Heat Sink Barrel Nut: The patented oversized heat sink barrel nut is one of the most significant innovations. At three inches long it completely emcompasses the bahmber and throat area of the barrel where expanding gas temperatures peak. Take into account the radiation properties of aluminum compared to traditional steel and you have 17 times more heat dissipation than a standard AR. POF's barrel nut's 3"" length also gives the operating rod substantial guiding surface assuring constant positive contact with the bolt carrier. POF's enhanced backbone receiver also move the upper's natural stress point forward. This adds a massive amount of rigidity to the overall platform and is critical when vertical fore grips are being pulled on the upper assembly. Bolt Carrier Group: POF's one piece NP3 plated bolt carrier is manufactured with the mechanical key built into the body and positioned behind the cam pin. This patented design helps reduce carrier tilt. POF's bolt carrier group features a chrome plated bolt, extractor, and firing pin. The finishes are both corrosion resistant and introduce lubricious characteristics to the action. Roller Cam Pin: POF's patented roller cam pin is just one more-example of how they strive to reduce friction and drag in the action. Standard AR cam pins feature a square steel head that literally grinds and carves away at the inside of the receiver. POF's NP3 coated roller head actually rolls inside the channel of the upper thus eliminating friction and prolonging the life of the upper. Anti-Tile Buffer Tube: POF's mil-spec aluminum anti-tilt buffer tube features ""carrier cradle"" extensions to ensure that the carrier is always supported by the buffer tube even when the bolt carrier is fully forward. This prevents carrier tilt and premature wear of the buffer tube. The buffer detent now doubles as a lock that inhibits the buffer tube from rotating and becoming loose under adverse conditions. The anti-tilt buffer tube also features three drain holes. Adjustable Gas System: The POF adjustable gas system consists of three major components, the gas plug, gas piston and operating rod. Residual gasses behind the bullet are routed into the gas block which drives both the piston and the op rod rearward in turn cycling the firearm. Suppressors add back pressure to a firearms operating system and thus increase bolt speed. This causes premature wear on the firearm and can even result in the bolt catching the discharged casing also known as ""stove piping"". The POF gas system allows the user to restrict, and even shut off, this extra back pressure by simply rotating the gas plug. Modular Railed Receiver: The patented Modular Railed Receiver (M.R.R) is POF's crown jewel for precision and extreme rigidity. This is a two piece upper assembly with a free-floating monolithic handguard that slides on and interfaces directly to the upper assembly tanks to their upper's reinforced backbone. This backbone is five-times thicker than standard flattop platforms. The suspended handguard keeps your grip and accessories from weighing on the barrel and with the help of their wedge block, reduces stress and flex in the barrel extension area. This ensures both extreme rigidity and accuracy by directing stress risers toward the upper assembly's strongest, most reinforced materials."

Don't sacrifice familiarity, speed, or accuracy when you need long range or high energy performance. Like th P415, the P308 features all of their Gen4 upgrades such as E2 Extraction Technology, ambidextrous fire controls, modular free floating rail platform, anti-tilit buffer tube, anti-tilt buffer tube, their M-LOK compatible M Rail, and more. The P308 is your best option for certainty in an uncertain world. Specifications:  Caliber: 7.62x51mm Nato Barrel: 16.5"" (1:10) Rail Length: 14.5"" M-Rail Weight: 8.1lbs-8.5lbs Length: 34""-39.5"" (collapsed) Trigger: Standard Drop-IN 4.5lb  Proprietary Technology & Features:  Gen4 Lower Receiver E2 Dual-Extraction Technology: POF's patented E2 dual-extraction technology consists of four small channels cut into the walls of the chamber allowing a small amount of gas pressure to push against the neck of the spent case. This pressure assists in extraction by breaking the seal between the chamber and case as well as pushing the spent case to the rear as the extractor is pulling to the rear. This removes a tremendous amount of work that would otherwise be left up to the extractor. Nitride Heat-Treated Barrel: Proper gas regulation and lubricated mechanics are nothing without the precision and durability of a quality barrel. POF's chrome alloy barrels are machined for absolute accuracy. POF's barrels are nitride heat-treated for full corrosion resistance. Triple Port Muzzle Brake: Designed to precisely compliment the POF platform their nitride heat-treated muzzle brake controls gas dispersion and reduces muzzle rise. It is effective in allowing the shooter to have faster follow up shots and has unbelievably soft felt recoil. It features blunt strike prongs and includes their nitride heat-treated collar jam nut. Oversized Heat Sink Barrel Nut: The patented oversized heat sink barrel nut is one of the most significant innovations. At three inches long it completely emcompasses the bahmber and throat area of the barrel where expanding gas temperatures peak. Take into account the radiation properties of aluminum compared to traditional steel and you have 17 times more heat dissipation than a standard AR. POF's barrel nut's 3"" length also gives the operating rod substantial guiding surface assuring constant positive contact with the bolt carrier. POF's enhanced backbone receiver also move the upper's natural stress point forward. This adds a massive amount of rigidity to the overall platform and is critical when vertical fore grips are being pulled on the upper assembly. Bolt Carrier Group: POF's one piece NP3 plated bolt carrier is manufactured with the mechanical key built into the body and positioned behind the cam pin. This patented design helps reduce carrier tilt. POF's bolt carrier group features a chrome plated bolt, extractor, and firing pin. The finishes are both corrosion resistant and introduce lubricious characteristics to the action. Roller Cam Pin: POF's patented roller cam pin is just one more-example of how they strive to reduce friction and drag in the action. Standard AR cam pins feature a square steel head that literally grinds and carves away at the inside of the receiver. POF's NP3 coated roller head actually rolls inside the channel of the upper thus eliminating friction and prolonging the life of the upper. Anti-Tile Buffer Tube: POF's mil-spec aluminum anti-tilt buffer tube features ""carrier cradle"" extensions to ensure that the carrier is always supported by the buffer tube even when the bolt carrier is fully forward. This prevents carrier tilt and premature wear of the buffer tube. The buffer detent now doubles as a lock that inhibits the buffer tube from rotating and becoming loose under adverse conditions. The anti-tilt buffer tube also features three drain holes. Adjustable Gas System: The POF adjustable gas system consists of three major components, the gas plug, gas piston and operating rod. Residual gasses behind the bullet are routed into the gas block which drives both the piston and the op rod rearward in turn cycling the firearm. Suppressors add back pressure to a firearms operating system and thus increase bolt speed. This causes premature wear on the firearm and can even result in the bolt catching the discharged casing also known as ""stove piping"". The POF gas system allows the user to restrict, and even shut off, this extra back pressure by simply rotating the gas plug. Modular Railed Receiver: The patented Modular Railed Receiver (M.R.R) is POF's crown jewel for precision and extreme rigidity. This is a two piece upper assembly with a free-floating monolithic handguard that slides on and interfaces directly to the upper assembly tanks to their upper's reinforced backbone. This backbone is five-times thicker than standard flattop platforms. The suspended handguard keeps your grip and accessories from weighing on the barrel and with the help of their wedge block, reduces stress and flex in the barrel extension area. This ensures both extreme rigidity and accuracy by directing stress risers toward the upper assembly's strongest, most reinforced materials."

Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle is a full-spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm Nato rounds on target in a variety of real world applications. From long range to standard carry, the R.E.P.R. is the fully equipped, highly versatile, ready to shoot rifle of choice. The heart of the R.E.P.R. Heavy Barrel is their revolutionary gas piston system. Constructed using the highest quality materials, built on their patented self-regulating short-stroke gas piston system, machined from materials that belong to the super alloy family of steel alloys most often used in aerospace, LWRCI raises the bar on reliability and ease of maintenance-delivering the highest level of performance. The R.E.P.R. Heavy Barrel upper and lower receivers are fully machined from billet 7075 aluminum, resulting in a superior fit and finish. Its 12.5"" Modular Rail System allows quick, tool-less access to the piston system via a removable top rail-that delivers 100% return to zero when reinstalled. The R.E.P.R. Heavy Barrel comes with a two-position gas block with normal and supressed settings. Gas block is easily accessible enabling the user to pre-restrict the gas flow to the piston system, allowing the rifle to run smoothly and compensate for the added back pressure from running a suppressor. Gas-piston sytem can be accessed quickly by loosening two thumb screws. An innovative side-mounted, non-reciprocating charging handle design allows shooters to keep eyes on target during reloads. The covered slot design prevents gas blowback to the face when firing suppressed. LWRC International's R.E.P.R. Heavy Barrel uses LWRCi manufactured-NiCorr treated cold Hammer Forged Heavy barrel that is precisely torqued in their factory. Nickel-boron coated bolt carrier delivers unparalleled wear resistance and permanent lubricity. Nickel-boron coated bolt carrier for unparalleled wear resistance, corrosion resistance, and permanent lubricity.

Cash price I will take 525.00 however value higher on trades. Thanks for looking. nine one 8 two three one two 7 five 6

The actuation of the lever action also does not cock the hammer into the firing position. Each time a round is chambered the hammer then has to be manually cocked in order to fire the rifle, making this an excellent safety feature for youth and beginner shooters. Although some of the bluing has deteriorated over the years, the bore is in excellent condition and shines like a mirror making this rifle a true tack driver.In Rough Condition Layaway Available!!! 20% Down & 4 Monthly Payments Item Number REDACTED"

Also included are an Old Faithful brand RH/OWB holster and a CZ-75 parts diagram cleaning mat.It's an opinion shared by many CZ fans that the PCR is the best carry gun in the company's inventory and if you want accuracy and rock-solid reliability in your carry gun the PCR is definitely worth a look.
