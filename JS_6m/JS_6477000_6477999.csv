It will come with a standard AR-15 stock by Ruger that was on the  Sling not included but I'll include the rear MBUS sight so you can use it at the get-go. Great and very accurate rifle.The second picture was while I was sighting in a red dot on it and at 25yd in a dimly lit range the red target dot was hard to see on the red meprolight dot. I was a newbie to the AR platform.Willing to sell upper and lower seperate. Upper $400. Lower $150. Whole rifle $500. Obo"

Hunt and to honor all the military members involved in Operation Attleboro during the Vietnam War.Much thought and attention to details went into this project to create the best knife and tool possible. The new Attleboro Knife is a 100% American made tactical military-use tool. It combines top quality manufacturing and unique design features.The steel is cutting edge CPM S35VN at a lighter .150” thick design to reduce weight and bulk for comfort when carrying. Cryogenically treated during heat treating, the knife is 55-57Rc to maintain flexibility and edge retention for a wide variety of user needs. The butt of the knife features a beveled glass breaker to aide those needing to break glass and to score and break through places that use polycarbonate for safety windows.The spine contains 1.5 inch of gimping to maximize grip with or without gloves for best control. The drop point blade supported by its aggressive styling swedge is a perfect combination to its CNC machined hollow grind. The uniquely angled serrations located on the right side of the blade help reduce snagging when using to tear through items such as rope or webbing.The black phenolic laminated handle is ergonomically designed to accommodate large and small hands and have a CNC machined texture to maximize grip in wet and dry applications. The Attleboro is finished with a beautiful Cerakote finish and a hair shaving sharp edge.Combat utility knife designed by retired Special Forces operatorsBlack Phenolic canvas laminate (black micarta) handleDrop point blade design with aggressive swedgeIndustry leading S35VN stainless steelH-146 Graphite Black Cerakote CoatingGlass breaker with Polycarbonate cutting edgePractically placed lanyard hole away from glass breakerSkeletonized handle for weight reductionErgonomic handle design for maximum comfort and gripLarge Choil for added blade controlUnique slanted serrations for better cuttingLatest large hollow grind technologyMachined Gimping for added gripMachined grooving in handle for added grip and styleThumb ramp for indexingCryo-treated bladeHollow ground bladeThicker than normal 8-32 hardwareIncluded with every knife is a black or tan custom made Kydex Sheath with your choice of mounting system options, either a TekLok, Malice Clip or IWB Soft Loop.

They have leather wrapped grips instead of the more prestigious ray skin common on the grip for a wealthy gentleman and no proof markings so I'm guessing they were for general training purposes or maybe even sent to the front for NCOs during late WWI when getting things out to the field quickly was important.  Each has a blade length of 33.5"" with a point of balance of ~4.5"" forward of the hilt. Their length overall is ~39.3"". Their weight is ~2.14 pounds each. They have an easy ~10 to 15, maybe as much as 20-degrees flex in the blades (see photos). No scabbards come with the swords.  THESE ARE REAL SHARPS! My cleaning/restoration has dulled the edges only slightly.  They came from the estate of a wealthy gentleman from Northern Alabama who spent many years (1960's to 1980s) as a businessman living in Europe and had several other fine quality European antiques is just one way I know they are authentic.  I cleaned and restored them for display in my home and am now down-sizing to live in an RV and travel the country with my wife for the next few years is the ONLY reason I am selling these beauties.  My restoration included disassembly and:  1. Scrubbing with steel wool to remove all oxidation 2. Polishing the blades on a buffer 3. Re-wiring the grip wrapping on the single fuller sword 4. Replacing the leather blade-to-basket shim on the double fuller sword.  The price each is $400.00 or the pair for $700.00.   No trade offers please since I am de-cluttering.    Thanks and have a great day!"

This is a brand new custom built AR15 in the 450 Bushmaster caliber. Total weight is a very light 6 lbs. 5 oz.   The upper is a Franklin Armory 7075-T6 aluminum forging made specifically for large caliber AR-15s like the Bushmaster 450 cartridge. The upper features a factory oversized ejection port, factory installed dust cover, and forward assist. The lower is a matching Franklin Armory 7075-T6 aluminum forging marked Multi Caliber. The lower contains a tensioning screw that can be used to remove all clearance between the upper and lower creating a wobble free assembly. The adjustable carbine stock, trigger guard, and grip are Magpul MOE in flat dark earth. The Magpul stock can be adjusted to 6 different positions. The Magpul MOE grip has a storage compartment. The lower parts kit is Milspec. The aluminum free float hand guard is a 12” long key mod rail system in flat dark earth. The top of the rail is full length picatinny with 2 additional 3” long FDE key mod rails that can be attached anywhere along the sides or bottom of the hand guard. The ported barrel is manufactured by custom barrel manufacturer Deadshot Barrels. This 16” barrel is of the heavy contour style and is manufactured from 4140 Chrome Moly steel with a non-reflective armor black Cerakote coating. The barrel is ported and therefore does not require a flash hider or muzzle brake. The ports act as a muzzle brake which keeps the recoil down and since it is integrated into the barrel the overall length is kept to a minimum. The barrel features a center feed ramp for proper feeding of the Bushmaster 450 cartridge. The barrel is manufactured for a carbine length gas system with a .875” diameter gas block seat. The underside of the barrel is dimpled for proper gas block alignment. Rifle comes with one stainless steel 5 shot magazine. Awesome looking and handling rifle. Nothing to do but mount some optics and start shooting. Rifle has been function fired to ensure proper function.
Payment: If local cash only. Must have an active drivers license and sign a bill of sale.
If shipping is required I will ship to a licensed FFL holder of your choosing for $40 which includes insurance. Payment can be in the form of USPS money order or cashier’s check.

There are some very small indentations on the bottom of the grip frame.  They wouldn't show up on camera which is why there is no photo of them.  There is NO holster wear or wear on the finish other than the normal drag lines on the cylinder.  This is an excellent choice for hog hunting or carrying as backup to your rifle.I'm asking $600 for the gun and I'm including THREE sets of grips for FREE (in addition to the grips on the gun for a total of 4 - ALL with custom fit aluminum grip spacers) to the buyer.  You will not find a better deal anywhere and, if you do, buy it....I'm not interested in any trades and I will not ship.  Local cash sales only."
