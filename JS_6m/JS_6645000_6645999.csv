Solid 2-3 MOA gun and I've never used quality ammo or a scope over 4x magnification. It's also loud as hell, cheap to shoot, and generally a truckload of fun.  I've put hours upon hours into this little lead cannon but I'm looking for a new project so I'm sending it on its way. Happy shooting. Questions welcome.
 
 - Type 53 Mosin-Nagant, 7.62x54R, I payed extra for hand-picked pristine bore.
 - Bayonet removed, barrel shortened to 17"", crowned, turned down and threaded 5/8x24, installed BRT Covert linear compensator (makes a hell of a fireball and saves your ears)
 - Front sight is screw-adjustable for windage and has standard AR-15 front sight post, elevation adjusts with AR front sight tool. Zeroed for 100 yards, can still use rear sight's elevation adjustments.
 - Installed AR-15 bayonet lug, can mount standard M9-type bayonets
 - Added vented heat shield.
 - Reinforced forearm and stock front with bedded-in cleaning rod.
 - Front sling loop accepts HK-style hook clips. Rear sling attachment is standard QD socket, sunk into the stock. Attach/detach your sling in seconds.
 - Russian side rail scope mount on the receiver. Accepts pretty much all Russian side-mount scopes and red dots, I used a PSO-1 (not for sale). Recommend a stock pouch with some foam underneath it get the correct cheek weld if using a scope. 
 - Action and bottom metal are glass bedded, pillar bedded, and the stock has a brass wrist pin in the grip (no cracks, just wanted extra durability). Finished in polyurethane with no stain. Barrel channel is free-floating. Ugly as hell but solid as stone.
 - Recoil pad is genuine Pachmayr Decelerator grind-to-fit pad. Tames the recoil nicely.
 - Trigger sear ground and polished, installed set screw for screw-adjustable pull weight. I keep it set at 3.5 lbs on my trigger scale, safe as a bank vault. Cock it and bang it on the ground all you want, it won't go off (I've tried). I wouldn't go too much lower than 3.5 lbs though. No trigger slop due to installed trigger spring. Installed set screw to eliminate overtravel. 
 - Metal parts blasted and finished in Brownells Alumahyde, matte black.
 - Bolt handle turned down, threaded, and oversized tactical bolt knob installed. 
 - Bold cold-blued until black.
 
 
This thing can start a campfire with its muzzle flash, and sometimes sets off car alarms in the parking lot when you shoot it, but it's still pretty mild to fire with its linear comp and Pachmayr recoil pad. Plus you can stab stuff with the bayonet, if you want.  
 
Included extras:
5 rounds of dummy ammunition
3 stripper clips
 
Available extras (prices possibly negotiable):
2x 440rd steel boxes of x54R, russian surplus corrosive ammo, unopened  - $175 each
M9 bayonet - $60

:  M&P 9mm 5 inch barrel. This is a new, never fired other than factory test. I got this as a warranty replacement. My competition equipment is taking a different path so all the competition S&W gear is for sale. I’m offering the pistol alone, or as part of a “kit”. None of the parts are going to be for sale by themselves until the pistol is sold. I’ll list the various options as a numbered group. Also if there is a different combination than what I listed, we can discuss that, as well as price negotiation. You can opt out of any of the parts options in each package. I don’t like selling gun stuff so this is new to me. None of the prices include shipping or transfer fees. They will be actual cost and I will calculate these fees as part of the negotiation.  I believe I can ship them to your FFL for around $45.00 Here we go….
Option 1: 9mm 5” M&P (not PC or pro) 3 magazines, night sights, no thumb safety, brand new. Comes with all the normal stuff in the plastic box. $450
Option 2: IDPA ESP package. Pistol plus… 4 SSS mag bodies and +0 basepads (plus an extra basepad and spring) I keep the stock 3 OE mags add $120. SSS ESP magwell add $44. Apex Flat Faced FSS kit installed, add $130. Apex Failure resistant extractor installed, add $34. CED Mag pouch, add $10. no extra charges for installation ($927 total)
Option 3: USPSA Limited package. Pistol plus…4 TF 140mm mags, add $168 (I keep the stock 3 mags, $50 credit) 3 TTI 140mm mags add $141. SSS Limited magwell add $44. Apex FF FSS trigger and sear kit installed add $130. Apex extractor installed add $34. CED mag pouch add $10. no extra charges for installation, ($967 total)
Option 4: USPSA Open package. Pistol plus…4 TF 140mm mags, add $168 (I keep the stock 3 mags, $50 credit) 2 TF 170mm mags, add $120. 3 TTI 140mm mags add $141. SSS Limited magwell add $44.  Apex FF FSS kit installed add $130. Apex extractor installed add $34. CED mag pouch add $10. No extra charges for previous installation. KKM threaded barrel, 200 rounds through it. Add $170. SJC 11 port compensator (new, never installed) add $95. Installation $25 (requires machining for proper fit, or you can hacksaw off the length and file it flat) SJC 90 degree frame mount and C-More 6MOA dot. Add $300, CMore is fresh from a refurbish at CMore, installation is $125 as it requires modification of the frame. Speed Shooter Specialties slide racker, add $26 (needed to rack the slide because of sight interference). Other useful items. Various recoil spring assemblies, 3 stock 17# assemblies add $18, 11#, 13# and 15# Carver Custom RSA’s $21 each, I’ll also include a bag of sear and trigger block spring pins and a bag of extractor spring pins (need to replace these every time they’re removed if you’re shooting major 9, no extra charge. I’ll also throw in a bottle of Loctite 272 for the comp. I also have a used Carver and SJC comps that I will also throw in at no extra cost, the threads are kind of “iffy” so their useful life is almost at an end. ($1869 total)
Again, all this is negotiable as to what part of the “packages” you want. I won’t be selling any of the parts until the pistol sells. Then the prices will be the same except for the installation part as the pistol will be gone. Sorry about the length of this post but I wanted to be as clear as possible. Thanks."

325,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6645325,For Sale:  Custom hi cap double stack modular 1911 aka 2011 officer size chambered in .40 S&W similar to STI VIP,"O'hare, Chicago, Illinois","$ 1,600","Listed On: Sunday, April 2, 2017",Handguns,no type,40 S&W                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"I am testing the waters on this one. I love this firearm! If it sells for my asking price, so be it. If it doesn't sell, that's OK too. I am POSSIBLY selling it to fund other interests.
 
You are looking at a completely custom built Modular 1911 AKA HI Cap 2011 pistol chambered in .40 S&W. This firearm was built to 1911 Officer frame and grip length. It holds 13 + 1 rounds. This was built a couple years back as the ultimate CCW pistol for me. All work was performed by a professional Machinist. This was built to be similar to the STI VIP, but with a .5"" shorter barrel, and a few more ""trick"" options like the Cylinder and Slide custom hammer and recessed mag.
 
Frame...
Pheonix Trinity 7075 Aluminum with a Wilson Nowlin ramp cut. The dust cover was finished to Officer length with a slight radius machined in to match, but mirror the bevel of the slide. The recoil rod frame side abutment was cut back .050"" rather than the full .100"" to keep from weakening the aluminum frame, and to allow lower barrel lug protection. The remaining .050 was removed from the recoil rod abutment plate to make for a bind free recoil spring. The recoil spring is a Wolff 24lb. Officer spring with 1 coil removed to ensure a bind free recoil system. The slide to frame fit was set at .001 clearance. This allows for reliable cycling even when the firearm gets hot. It was set up as a defense firearm, not a super tight mantel piece. 
 
Grip area....
The grip is a polymer STI double stack grip that was shortened .825"" in length to make it Officer length. It was shaved of factory castings, and it along with the polymer Officer main spring housing were stippled in a Starburst pattern for aesthetics, and a positive hand grasp. The trigger guard then had finger reliefs added for grip comfort. The trigger, and mag release are also both STI. The trigger is the STI aluminum version. The magazine is a STI magazine that was custom shortened to fit the grip (It can use any .40 S&W STI double stack magazine, but will have a gap at the lower well area. A 120mm length mag will yield a .200 gap). It will hold 13 rounds of .40 S&W with one more in the chamber with this custom mag. The grip safety is a GI that was blended to the frame and grip after having the upper extension removed. The extension was removed due to not being needed because of the custom hammer, and it is one less thing to stab you when you are concealing. The mainspring is a factory Colt Officer spring. The trigger / sear spring is a Wolff. The sear was custom gound and polished, then the weight was set to a light crisp 3.5lb. pull.
 
Slide....
The slide is a stainless steel 3.5"" Officer slide. It was lightened, the sides were then block sanded, and polished to a mirror shine. The slide serrations were milled .015 below side height so grip tape could be installed flush with the sides. The grip tape was used so you can rack the slide in ALL conditions, including wet hands, or a wet firearm. Extra grip tape cut to size will come with the firearm so you have replacements, and templates if you choose to change the color. The top of the slide is brushed stainless as to not cause a glare in your sight picture. The sights are large white dot GI slights. These sights were used because the rear can be used to rack the slide on your boot if God forbid you were to loose use of an appendage. I will also include an adjustable rear target sight for the GI dovetail cut in case that is the sight route you prefer.
 
Barrel....
The barrel is a Stainless Fusion Firearms 3.5"" match grade bull barrel chambered in .40S&W. It has a Wilson Nowlin ramp that has been polished to feed like a dream. The hood was fit within .002 of the slide on the sides, and breach face. The muzzle end was finished with a 45 degree crown, and a match grade stainless bushing was used, and custom fit. The barrel lockup is .051 due to hand match fit and finish of the lugs. 
 
 
Hammer.....
The hammer is something special too. It is made by Cylinder and Slide. It is called the S.F.S Safety Fast Shooting. It allows you to carry the firearm cocked, and locked.......BUT WITH THE HAMMER DOWN! I attempted to paste a link to it, but this site will not allow me to. Look it up on the net to see how it works.
 
The round count is under 300 down the barrel. I have fired 20 rounds of all box stock ammo you find at Wally World both FMJ, and Hollow point SD, and 50 rounds of my own personal coated lead reloads.

Every single part on this rifle is ORIGINAL from the John Moses Brownings factory! The only parts that are NOT original are the parts that make this gun semi-automatic. The following parts were made by Ohio Ordnance Works in order to be semi-auto compliant with the ATF: the receiver is marked (Model 1918 A3 U.S. Cal. 30), fire control group (trigger) and the bolt. ALL other components are ORIGINAL BAR parts. The barrel has the Ordnance bomb mark proving it was made at the Browning factory and it's also marked (03-53), that's March of 1953 which means it was most likely built for the Korean War and was used in combat. Ohio Ordnance Works did a very nice job on their reproduction of the BAR, but theirs DO NOT have original Browning parts. Mine does. Ohio Ordnance charges $4,300 for their reproduction BAR's and they are out of stock. Since mine has original BAR parts, it's worth far more than theirs and the original parts are not cheap! Look them both up for yourself. I'm asking far less than they are for a real one and you can't get these anymore without paying a ridiculous price. My price is firm. I'm ONLY interested in trading for an FNC rifle straight over the table, so please don't try to trade me your AK or AR! I might consider other trades if they have historical C&R value. The pictures I posted I got off the internet because I currently have the BAR disassembled for cleaning, but it looks exactly the same as the pictures I posted. First come, first serve, cash and carry! If you want a real BAR this is your chance to get one for a very reasonable price!"

Basically this all appears to be good ammo, but it comes with the caveat that some of it is reloaded. At least, I suspect around half of the pistol ammo is reloaded, and so is some of the .308. Most of the .357 I'm selling is marked in .38 SPL cases, but they appear to be once-fired brass, so I would treat them like .357 for safety.

Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself. With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, a checkered slide release and an ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull-even and smooth. Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target.

However, I do like to trade and need a good semi auto shotgun, as some low life stole my SX3.The rifle has been shot 13 times, from what I have been told, and looks brand new. It was made in the old CT factory that has since gone out of business. It has an extractor on the bolt. It will also include a few boxes of factory ammo, 50 pieces of sealed virgin winchester brass, a set of dies, and a box of 162 eld-x that I planned to load for it. This entire package is beautiful and like new.Looking to trade for a nice semi auto. May add cash for the right deal. Also interested in other things, like revolvers, nice semi auto pistols, rifles, high end optics, fishing stuff, archery (traditional and compound), Jon boats, guitars... Almost anything. I may end up deciding to keep this because it is so nice, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to test the waters. I have way too many rifles for the purpose this one serves. Thanks!"
