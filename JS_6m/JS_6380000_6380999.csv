Select fire weapons are already very heavily regulated under the 1934 National Firearms Act which requires you to register your gun and submit a tax stamp. Since 1934 there have only been 2 known homicides committed with a legally owned fully automatic firearm and one of them was caused by a police officer. This law does nothing to prevent crime and it raises the price of legal automatic weapons to a ludicrous price due to supply and demand. Repealing the unconstitutional Hughes amendment will restore our second amendment rights that have been under attack for a very long time.Repeal the Hughes amendment petition needs 100k signatures by February 19, 2017 to get a response from the White House Google search: repeal the nfa petition, repeal hughes amendment petition Sign up today and share with everyone you know..Check my other listings for great deals on guns!"

The sights are FANTASTIC! But I have run into a money shortage while building a house. Need $ for the roof. Can throw in a box of 7.62x51 NATO as well. Asking $1,600 but may come down. Possibly interested in trades. But it would have to be equal value. Not interested in ARs chambered in 223 or 556 or revolvers. I am interested in .45, 9mm, hunting rifles, lever action, and especially sig MPX 2nd gen and MP5 clones. Possibilities.

It's in absolute mint condition, which is mostly why I'm willing to part with it, it just sits in the safe and gets oiled regularly with the other guns, hasn't been shot since 2008 when I bought it new, would estimate I put less than 150 rounds through it. Comes with the Beretta Barrel shroud as pictured, the two factory magazines (I never bought more otherwise I would include them), factory cleaning rod kit, all the factory paperwork, hard case and a Tasco Reddot sight as pictured.Beretta is still manufacturing the CX4 Storm in 9mm and .40 Cal however they no longer produce the .45 Cal version so whatever is out there is it. This is a fun, bulletproof built carbine. I believe $750 is a fair price, I'm not hurting for cash, just interested in making room for more toys in the toy box so to speak."

A forgiving eye box with increased eye relief gets shooters on target quickly and easily. Built on an ultra-strong 30mm one-piece machined aluminum tube for increased windage and elevation travel and optimal adjustment.

The Asylum Weaponry AW500 (The Gatekeeper) was built on a Mossberg 500 Cruiser Pistol Grip only Firearm. The overall length of the firearm is 26 1/2"". This is achieved by using a complete 14"" front end from a Mossberg 590A1 and a Shockwave Technologies birds head grip to get to the 26 1/2"" overall length. The Mossberg 500 Cruiser (50588) that this firearm is made from ships from Mossberg with a pistol-grip already installed and a 20"" barrel. By definition of what the ATF considers a shotgun the original firearm was never a shotgun despite it's ability to fire shotgun shells. This firearm is considered an ""other"" because in order to fit the definition of a shotgun it must have been manufactured with a shoulder stock in order to be ""fired from the shoulder"". Therefor it cannot be considered a ""sawn-off"" shotgun either as it never met the ATF's criteria to be a shotgun in the first place. Since this firearm is not a shotgun, it is not required to have at least an 18"" barrel. Also the overall length exceeds 26"" therefor it cannot be classified as a AOW (Any Other Weapon) which would require a tax stamp and Class III registration with the ATF."

The rear stock is finished with a fitted recoil pad. Full choke 2 3/4"" barrel. This is a great shotgun for finishing or putting together for years of hunting/target shooting. A good gunsmith will have no trouble putting this shotgun together in no time.

You must be legally allowed to purchase a firearm in order to buy this from me and all NFA rules apply. I will ship to an FFL but you pay shipping and insurance. The PWS upper and lower receivers are now forged, allowing for a stronger and lighter product. A common known fact that has been lost through the marketing efforts of many AR 15 manufacturers is that a forging can produce a piece that is much stronger than a billet part. As the metal is shaped during the forging process, its internal grain aligns to follow the general shape of the part. As a result, the grain is continuous throughout the part, giving rise to a part that is stronger, yet lighter, than a billet part.PICMOD TECHNOLOGYThe MOD 2 handguard has been equipped with the new PicMod Technology. This allows you to mount any KeyMod™ attachment anywhere on your rail while being able to mount most Picatinny accessories directly to the rail in the areas where the PicMod feature is present.This gives you the most mounting options without having to use KeyMod™ mounted Picatinny rail sections, adding unnecessary width and weight to your rifle.MAXIM CQB PISTOL EXCThe MOD 2 pistol comes with the Maxim CQB Pistol EXC making it lightweight and fun to shoot. This Maxim CQB Pistol EXC only adds 5.35” to your receiver at its most collapsed position with no special bolt carrier needed. It adjusts to 4 total positions giving your AR15 pistol the adjustments needed for the perfect cheek weld. The EXC is also perfect to use on your soon-to-be short barreled AR15 while you’re waiting on your Form 1 to clear. Once the form clears, simply swap out the cheek brace.SUPERIOR FITEverything about the MOD 2 has been designed to be an incredibly accurate fit and finish, including the new handguard mounting system, which features a trunnion machined into the upper receiver.AMBIDEXTROUSWe’ve added ambidextrous controls for the safety selector, bolt release, and mag release to enhance the ease of use.SPECIFICATIONSWeight -5 lb 10 ozBarrel Length – 7.75″Chamber - .223 WyldeOverall Length – 26.5""Gas Piston System – PistolBarrel Twist – 1:8Send me a message for pics.

Lacking an import mark, it was likely brought back by a GI returning from WWII, the Korean conflict, or the Vietnam War. The damage to the barrel indicates the slide was locked to the rear at the time the damage occurred.Due to the slide/barrel damage this pistol is considered UNSAFE TO FIRE in it's current condition.
