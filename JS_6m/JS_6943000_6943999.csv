Selling a 4 door 2009 blue Chevy Cobalt. It has been very well kept getting regular tune-ups, break jobs, and oil changes. The miles are 90% from going to and from work. Engine is still like new and sounds like it too. Very smooth and quite ride.
The exterior is in great condition with the exception of the small damage above the driver's side rear tire. The interior is pretty good too with the exception of some stains from work boots/clothes but no rips or tares. A good detailing job should get rid of most of it.
Everything works, no hidden issues with windows, locks, or any other equipment. All lights work and nothing leaks. Tires are brand new all the way around. Just purchased them last month. Have bill of sale for proof. Heat and air conditioning works perfect.

Yes, that is a rubber band. Because it had the quad rail, I did not have the retaining pin for the front hand guard at that time of the pic.This is an older CETME I acquired, and by older, I mean the hit or miss CAI ones from the first time they began offering them (if I am not mistaken). Luckily, this one does not have the typical CAI CETME problems from that era. What do I mean? The bolt is not ground, it cycles well, and it is within specs although rollers may want to be installed to increase gap.It is a very nice rifle and in pretty good shape. I have shot it once and it cycled beautifully after my cleaning it and ensuring the specs were right. It's currently wearing the OD Green standard German milsurp furniture. I also have a quad rail for it, and H&K collapsible stock. I also have (5) 20-round mags and a milsurp cleaning kit for it. Also have a sling. The rifle does not currently have a muzzle attachment on it, but does have the threads to accommodate one.Depending on trade, I can throw in up to 500 rounds of .308."

In addition the extractor has been modified, the rails polished, the extractor ramp modified, the BHO modified, the internal spring for recoil has been changed and the BHO spring modified.The gun has a Chaos Titan Quad Rail System that hinges up out of the way for easy access to the dust cover.It also has the Chaos HK Style sights installed. These sights will co-witness with the Burris FastFire sight-optionalThere is also a Krebs Custom Safety in place of the standard factory safety.The Bolt Carrier has been completely polished and a custom turned and welded upturned charging handle installed.The bottom of the carrier has also been jeweled.The trigger pull is approx 4 lbs. but can be lowered by us if desired19"" barrel.A Hogue Overmolded Grip has been installed.Paint has been touched up with a solvent resistant Ceramic based paint.The rear tang has been removed and the rear of the receiver has been reshaped and an internal support block has been installed to support the ACE hardware.ACE SOCOM stock with Foam cheek weld and ACE Push Button folding mechanism with a 1"" ACE Butt pad really pads down recoil.Couple that with a Hogue rubber pistol grip and a Tromix Shark brake which alone reduces felt recoil by 15% and the gun is a dream to shoot.The gun can be fired with the stock open or folded.We then drill a 4th port in the barrel if there wasn't 4 to begin with and slightly enlarge all the gas ports to aid in the gun's ability to cycle low brass ammo such as bird shot and the low recoil stuff. We then open the gas block port to clear the 4 gas ports and add an adjustable gas knob that has been modified to work with our gas port work.A RAM ambidextrous mag release extension is also added.An after market reduced power recoil spring is also added.Fire the gun, release a mag, lock open the bolt, all without taking your hand off the pistol grip.The gun handles flawlessly as all guns modified by our gunsmiths go to the range for testing and 20 or more rounds put through them before shipping.This is a new gun under warranty-we list it as used because it is not the way it comes from the factory.The BHO was notched and reshaped for greater reliability and so it doesn't poke into your finger with the trigger in it's new location.See our other modified Saigas.Shipping is free.Ask me any questions.Accept western union alone, We'll even take a personal check if we are making mods to the gun for you.We will ship to any part of USA. Bullet Button is required @ 55 dollars installed in place of the mag release extension.for the gun to be released to you,you must pay atleast half of the payment then when you receive your gun you balance up..no tricks.This gun is fully 922R compliant even if using the factory mag.It will fire as fast as you can humanly pull the trigger and eats just about anything from Bulk Pack Federal 7.5 shot to slugs.If you want a different stock we will adjust the price up or down.

It has about 1200 to 1500 rounds through it and it runs good. Like most AR22's it loves high velocity ammo. It will run cheaper ammo better than most AR22's but it does not like it. It is a S&W AR22 clone. It has a floating quad rail and comes with two mags. One mag is an ATI 28 round and one S&W 25 round. The S&W AR22 mags work well in this AR. It also comes with 200 rounds of high velocity ammo. This AR22 is not like a Mossberg or those other cheap 22 AR's. It uses a 5.56 lower receiver. I had many people at the range who thought it was an AR15 with a 22LR conversion kit. I paid $299 for the upper and $150 for the lower. I am asking for $350. Email me if interested.

The weight, balance, look, feel and most of the controls’ placement and operation are just like the 5.56 mm x 45 NATO rifle. It is the perfect platform for training purposes and also makes a fun, reliable target rifle.
The ARX160 .22 LR offers easy access to the bolt and trigger system, like it’s 5.56 counterpart. The 20 round magazine provides for lots of target practice with relatively little reload time. Equipped with an expansive accessory rail, ambidextrous, two position safety lever and charging handle, the ARC160 is one versatile plinker."

There are dozens of different ammunition choices with this pistol, anywhere from hollow points to high penetration rounds, all of which move at over 2000fps. This particular pistol has custom stippling on the grip as well as the slide, to ensure that you always maintain positive control of your modern day Mjolnir and are able to power stroke your slide hard enough to give Chris Costa a stroke. I love this pistol, I just need something that I can more practically carry, without spending additional money. It's had well under 500 rounds through it. I also have 1060 rounds of SS197 sporting rounds, if you want to buy fuel to keep your new nugget popper running. $1,100 for the pistol, or $1,500 for the pistol and ammo. That's roughly $18/box for the ammo, which is super cheap."

This rig was built with a varmint hunting dream trip out west in mind but actual use was very light target shooting on a rifle range. I don't do pictures of any kind and have never seen another in person but you can google some photos, they came in several calibers. Mine has a black upper on silver frame and scope and looks NEW. The price is $1000, but if you only want the upper, I'll sell the ACTION ONLY for $500, and you can put it on your 1911 frame.

It comes with 2 ten round magazines and a factory five round magazine. This shotgun runs flawlessly and shoots any rounds you can find. I have even had bird shot cycle properly in this firearm. This model has the folding stock. It is insanely fun !
