Custom built Remington 700 long range sniper rifle – very close to the USMC M4 spec with slight enhancements. I built the rifle from the Remington receiver on out. This rifle features a full-floated 26-inch heavy contour Remington barrel (.820 in. at the muzzle), threaded and tanker style break.  It is a precision tack driver, consistent ¼ inch MOA with less than 100 rounds through it. I enjoy building these rifles more than I do shooting them for my hobby. Looking to sell this one to begin my next build. Total investment was $2,200 with the glass. Scope (glass) IS included. Scope is barely used Sightmark Triple Duty 8.5-25x50. Original scope which I am not selling my Vortex Viper HS 4-16x44 which was in the original build. You will not find a rifle like this for less than $2,000 - $3,000 anywhere. Additionally, the lead time to have one built (by competent gunsmith) is at least 8 months. Price is firm. I will consider trades in order to sell my rifle faster but they must be of equal or greater value because all I will do is turn aaround and sell them for cash (which puts time and risk on me). Remember, my goal is cash because I am chomping at the bit to start another build.

CHAMBERED IN 5.56 NATO.    Ruger® Rapid Deploy folding rear sight provides windage adjustability, and pairs with the elevation adjustable front sight for a solid, reliable aiming system. The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed.   Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear. (Model 8502 features a fixed stock.)   Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.   Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability.   Front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A2-style F-height allows co-witness with many optics.     Patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts most standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired.   Milled gas block is located at a carbine-length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug (model 8500 only), for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface.   Cold hammer-forged 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed. (Model 8500 only.)   Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control.

It comes with nights sights, 3 magazines, a hard case, and all the factory paperwork. These are fantastic pistols and this is the cheapest you will find it anywhere!In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany.

This rifle has been shaved and custom fitted to the receiver. The bolt was stripped, cleaned, reassembled, and the action polished to remove any factory imperfections. The action cycles, feeds, and fires flawlessly. The outside of the receiver/barrel assembly was carefully stripped, etched, and reblued with professional grade bluing giving this rifle a unique and rugged texture. The muzzle brake is machined from 10/18 steel, not aluminum like many cheaper versions. The barrel is not counterbored, and the crown is in great shape. The trigger was machined to reduce the draw weight to 3lbs, yet will not release upon accidental bumps or potential drops. The receiver has not been drilled. Rather the rear sight was removed to expose the 3/8 dovetail, and the rail was mounted. The optic is a 11"" eye relief, 36 color, variable intensity, 2-7x44 30mm scope. It is currently zeroed to 75 yards. Mosins are ammo snobs. They fire best using surplus rounds, which are available in 880rd cans almost anywhere on the internet. 100 rounds of match grade PPU included.More information upon request. Open to trades +/- cash, just be reasonable. FFL transfer only at any Nashville area dealer."

Walther CCP Black The all new CCP  (Concealed Carry Pistol) in 9mm Luger has an ideal combination of style, ergonomics, size, shape, accuracy, and ability to conceal comfortably. The new Walther SOFTCOIL ™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm. With an overall length of just 6.41 inches, the Walther CCP is a sleek solution to concealed carry protection. The new model’s barrel length is 3.54 inches and its width is only 1.18 inches making it easily carried in a purse or inside-the-pant holster. This CCP provides all the features that have become a signature of Walther’s line of pistols. It has a smooth 5.5 pound trigger pull, interchangeable front sight with white dot, adjustable rear sight, and reversible magazine release for left- or right-handed operation. This new single-stack semi-automatic has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds. For maximum safety, the CCP comes equipped with a slim manual thumb safety and one internal safety that acts as a firing pin block. As with all Walther firearms, the CCP has an ergonomic grip with a unique non-slip surface. Other key attributes of the firearm include an easy access slide stop, loaded chamber indicator for added safety, and serrations (front, rear and trigger guard) for additional safety and control of its easily manipulated slide.Features - Front Sight with White Dot - Picatinny Rail - Smooth Trigger - Reversible Magazine ReleaseHow Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology Makes This Pistol A Must-Have The CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case. Finish: Black Type: Pistol Action: Single Caliber: 9mm Barrel Length: 3.5"" Capacity: 8+1 Safety: Manual Thumb Grip: Integral Sight: 3-Dot Adjustable Low Profile Weight: 22.3 oz"
