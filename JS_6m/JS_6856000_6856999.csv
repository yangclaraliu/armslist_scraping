NOTE: THIS PIECE CAME FROM MASSACHUSETTS AND CAN BE SOLD TO A PROPERLY LICENSED MASS RESIDENT IF TRANSFERRED THROUGH A MASS FFL DEALER. This fine model was introduced by Smith & Wesson in 1980 and is still manufactured today. Our example is the first issue with no dash after the model number. It’s a sturdy, powerful revolver which has been used by many law enforcement agencies and the Federal Government. Ours is serial number ADB8801. It was built on the new L target frame. This frame has a full lug under the barrel that adds some weight and stability which was welcome to many shooters who felt that the K frame was too light to handle this powerful cartridge. The revolver has a 6 inch barrel, with a ramp front sight and there is Aimpont base mounted on top of the frame and barrel just waiting to have you install your own. The original black rear sight adjustable for windage and elevation is included. The condition is about 94%. There is the faintest possible drag line on the cylinder, a couple of little rubs and light scratches here and there. Semi-heavy target hammer and smooth combat trigger. The Goncalo Alves grips are excellent. An early 686 that will give you many hours of shooting pleasure. Don’t miss out on this beauty. FFL required. $35.00 shipping."

This weapon is perfected, and therefore no longer fun for me. I built it back when it cost 3-4g to make a tack driving AR.Custom stainless Dedicated Technology (made by ""Oly Mike DTech"") crowned and fluted 1:8 twist and integrated compensator. Low profile gas block to allow for easy/total cleaning, bi-pod mount, bi-pod, competition sling and sling mount, hand stop, White Oak match rifle float tube, stainless Jewell 2 stage trigger, Magpul grip, Badger Ordinance tactical charging handle latch, headspaced, spotless bolt, Sig Sauer Stock. Yes, I traded out some of the stuff I had on it.
Comes with 4 boxes of custom loaded rounds in reloading cases with the recipe that turns her into a tack driver that is no longer fun for me to shoot because of how accurate she is."

Excellent condition for an early 1960's piece with a very deep blue finish; a little wear and tear but it's minimal. Price includes 3 correct magazines, original grip (an aftermarket grip shown on the pistol in the pictures), an ""issue"" flap holster, a nice little black leather carry holster, and 68 rounds of ammo. Most of what appears to be wear in the pictures is just reflections in the extremely deep blued finish, there is some wear but it's not bad at all. American Rifleman had an excellent article on East German Makarov's a couple of years ago and says that they are the most sought after versions out there and typically sell for $400 to $500+ depending on condition. I'm willing to entertain CLOSE offers only, don't even bother with low-ball offers as I won't waste my time responding as this one is in way above average condition and I've priced in the middle of the range. Not interested in any trades. Proof of age and Missouri residency will be required at time of transfer and a bill of sale will be provided. Willing to deliver within a 50 mile radius of Buffalo, MO.     Thanks for looking..."

I'm selling it because I could use the money. With that being said, I'm not in a hurry to sell it so low-ballers need not apply. All Trades are considered, but unlikely as I want the money for home projects. It comes with the new leupold base and a nice set of leupold 30mm stainless rings that match the receiver perfectly. I still have the box and all paperwork. Private Bill of sale required. Thanks tor looking. Scope NOT included, but could be with right offer, and will sell separately. It's a nightforce shv 5-20x56. With MOAR. Look it up, excellent scope. Thanks for looking all questions are welcome. If the listing is up it's available, I will not respond to the ""is this still available"" messages.

It has a couple flaws that could use some work, but they are purely aesthetic and nothing that stops the gun from functioning. For more details, contact me and I can send you a link to a google docs page I made (I'm not supposed to post links in description).Open to selling, trading, or trade + money. For trades I'd be particularly interested in any sort of AK (pistol or Rifle), something in 5.56 would be awesome, but open to 7.62 as well. Also a glock 19 or Sig P226 would peak my interest, but I like all types of guns, so feel free to contact me if you have a different gun you're looking to trade.

Anyway, I have the box (which isn't perfect) the little plastic oil can, the sling, and the butt-stock cleaning kit is there. On the main bolt spring, there is a rusty colored oil/grease which I assume is the facotry grease. I left it alone. Also, all the metal seems to have the factory finish intact. The numbers do not match for some reason but it's a nice rifle. The other rifle in the one pic is my other Norinco, which has definetly been shot and the finish is not so great anymore. More pics on request.I am pricing high to see what offers I get. These days, a not so good SKS fetches at least $350."

I also have the original 10 round magazine and a 5 round aftermarket magazine that I'll throw in. As I have reduced the asking price several times I am NOT interested in any offers (unless they're for more money!), it's priced as low as I'm ever going accept.

The slide work has already been done by Loki Tactical 300.00, Warren Tactical Tritium 3 Dot sights 140.00, and the factory stock Glock 23 gen4 550.00, my total expense + tax 1000.00. Now for 800.00 you get the glock as it stands now plus 950rds of quality .40 ammo FREE. 600rds of target and 350rds of JHP. What's needed to be finish is the lower stippled/magwell, match grade barrel, and a match grade trigger. The ammo alone is a 400.00 value. No trades I really need the dough really. Must be able to legally own this handgun. I'm willing to sell the ammo separately at a discount. Thanks for looking."

Re-chambering 357Mag to 357Max is a meticulous and knowledge driven process that should not be done by just any gunsmith.

He is author of ""The Great Remington 357 Max Revival"" and a contributing author to numerous magazines and journals with articles specializing in ballistics and firearm accuracy. As well as shooting the 357Max, it also shoots three other calibers:38 Special, 357Mag, and 360DW. Exceptional quality and superior workmanship went into making this rifle into a platform for the 357Max with superior ballistics. This rifle is in excellent condition as you would expect for a NIB rifle.Use for sillouette target shooting and/or hunting predators, deer, antelope, feral hogs, and even black bear and elk.

Perfect for a youth, woman or small handed person. Very acurate and fun to shoot. John Browning created the Model 1911, a pistol by which all modern semi-automatic handguns are judged. Rather than taking that original design and converting it from a center fire pistol into a rimfire, Browning engineers created an 85% scale 1911 designed specifically to shoot the .22 LR cartridge. The result was a purpose built pistol that is accurate, reliable, lightweight, and a lot of fun to shoot."
