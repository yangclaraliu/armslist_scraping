A great collector piece or family heirloom to pass down. Benjamin Tyler Henry invented a revolutionary repeating rifle in the late 1850s that became the most important firearm of its time. First used during the Civil War, the rifle had rapid fire capability that set it far above the single shot muskets commonly in use. The Henry Original rifle is virtually identical to its historic ancestor in all ways except caliber. The first Henry repeater was chambered in .44 Rimfire, a caliber that is long obsolete. Instead, the Henry Original is chambered in .44-40 Winchester, a caliber that has historical significance of its own. Every rifle's serial number begins with BTH in tribute to its inventor. The Original Henry Rare Carbine features a hardened brass receiver with the same tensile strength as steel, a 20.5"" octagonal barrel, tubular magazine, a fancy American Walnut stock and classic folding ladder rear sight. Specifications and Features: Henry Original Rare Carbine H011R .44-40 Winchester caliber Lever action repeater 20.5"" octagonal barrel 10 rounds capacity Hardened Brass Receiver Folding ladder rear sight, blade front sight Fancy grade American walnut stock Brass butt plate Made entirely in the USA Overall length 39.5"" Weight 8.49 lbs"

There are a few light scuffs and small dings in the stock but overall it is in excellent condition. The action is a pleasing grey finish with a Edelweiss motif on the front and back receiver bridges as well as the highly ornate floor plate. This rifle was obviously built for mountain hunting so the decorative styling matches. The barrel is a full tapered octagon with a matte rib and iron. sights. The blue is perfect from end to end and the bore is bright and shiny. The rifle was built with claw mounts and a factory fitted high quality Swarovski 6X scope with 42MM objective. As you might expect it has the typical German crosshair. The rifle with scope tips the scales at 8.5lbs exactly. This is an unbelievably beautiful and functional rifle."

XCR-L incorporates heavy duty components such as a sturdy oprod, a beefy three-lug bolt, a locking extractor, and a fixed ejector.   These elements and others ensure reliable performance with minimal. Many rifles claim to be modular weapon systems just because they  have a 1913 standard rail system used to attach accessories.  The  XCR-L is truly modular. With one XCR-L Lower Receiver (the serialized part), the operator can configure the XCR as a shorty for close quarters combat, a light  weight carbine, or a longer marksman's rifle. The XCR-L's quick change barrel system is unmatched in terms of ease of use and repeatability.  Barrel and caliber changes can  be made in less than 5 minutes."

Date of manufacture is 1994. This Colt is the Enhanced model with a solid, ribbed flat-top slide, up graded (3-dot) sights both front and rear, angled serrations on the slide, finger cutout under the trigger guard, beaver tail grip safety, and elongated hammer. The action is nice and tight functioning as it should. The bore and chamber are excellent. The grips are hand crafted from vintage camel bone that has been stabilized, no chips or scratches. This has an aluminum trigger and steel mainspring housing. The slide release, thumb safety and beaver tail have been fire blued. This Colt has been finished in French grey. The engraving is mine, done in a 19th century Old West style. I engraved it with deep chiseled cuts to allow for years of wear and tear. The rear of the gun has been left unengraved, and in matte, dark grey so as not to visually interfere while sighting. The magazine is not a Colt product although it functions well with ball ammo. I would be willing to engrave the buyer’s Colt magazine at no charge."
