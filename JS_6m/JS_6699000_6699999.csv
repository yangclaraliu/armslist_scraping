Excellent shooter! Excellent value!I'm considering trading my long range beauty for something a little more tacticool. I guess I would probably sell this package instead if someone twisted my arm but trades of interest will come first. This is a Remington 700 action with a 26"" bull barrel sitting in a KRG X-ray chassis with adjustable cheek piece. The optic is a Leupold 4-12x that is super clear. If I keep this rifle I will definitely go up to a 25x magnification but I've already shot a sub 4"" group at 300 yards with this setup. I'm sure someone with better eyes could take it out farther as is but I'm about half blind. :)I acquired this Used so I can't provide an accurate round count but it appears to be minimal based on condition (this thing is like new). Rifle will come with a weatherproof lockable Plano case with custom foam cutout.

Like all P-11 models, it's chambered in 9mm, and is a double action only (DAO) pistol. The Kel-Tec P-11HC is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Despite its small size, the P11HC has the power, effectiveness and felt recoil of much larger pistols. The Kel-Tec P-11HC makes for a great carry pistol.The P-11 series of pistols have six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards.The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine, the P-11PK will also accept larger capacity magazines for S&W model 59 series of pistols. To improve the handling with S&W magazines Kel-Tec recommend using their slip on magazine extension.Kel-Tec P-11 Specifications:Caliber: 9 x 19 mm LugerWeight unloaded: 14 oz. 400gLoaded magazine: 6 oz. 159gLength: 5.6"" 142mmHeight: 4.3"" 109mmWidth: 1"" 26mmBarrel Length: 3.1"" 79mmSight radius: 4.6"" 116mmMuzzle Energy Max: 400ft-lbs 540JCapacity: 10 + 1Trigger Pull: 9 lbs 40NFrame: black polymerSlide: hard chromeWhat's included?-Hard Case-Trigger Lock-KEL-TEC P11HC-HARD CHROME-BLACK GRIP 10+1RND 9MM-1 MagIMPORTANT NOTE: Buyer must sign bill of sale and provide a Valid U.S. Photo ID."
