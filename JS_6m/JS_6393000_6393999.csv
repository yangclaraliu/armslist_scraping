This rifle is brand new in the box and unfired. It's hard to find a NEW M70 Extreme Weather rifle in the .308 caliber these days, so this is a good opportunity. The Extreme Weather is essentially a stainless steel Super Grade Mod. 70. This rifle retails for $1,270. I am not interested in trades and the price is firm.
The following is Winchester's description of this rifle:
Exceptional bolt-action hunting rifle for adverse weather, Bell and Carlson stock, aluminum bedding block, matte stainless action and fluted barrel, M.O.A. trigger system, Pachmayr Decelerator recoil pad.
 
Get extreme accuracy under any conditions. The Model 70 Extreme Weather Stainless utilizes a Bell and Carlson™ lay-up composite stock that provides a solid feel and features trim and lightweight ergonomics. It has a textured charcoal gray matte finish for rugged good looks and improved grip in adverse conditions. The sculpted cheekpiece helps insure proper eye-to-scope alignment from any shooting position. The thick, black Pachmayr® Decelerator® pad helps take the felt recoil bite out of high performance magnum cartridges.
Other key features. Like all Model 70s today, it features the Pre'-64 type claw extractor with Controlled Round Feeding so the cartridge may be easily withdrawn from the chamber at any point after it leaves the magazine. It also means that the cartridge base is grabbed by the claw as it leaves the magazine so it enters the chamber straight, in line. And don't forget that the cartridge feed lips are machined as part of the receiver for improved reliability in feeding. The classic Three-Position Safety offers both on safe and fire positions, plus a middle position that locks the firing pin yet still allows the bolt to be operated, providing a greater margin of safety when checking the chamber condition or unloading.
Accuracy is paramount. The Extreme Weather SS rifle's free-floating fluted stainless steel barrel is made in the same factory as those found on U.S. military rifles and machine guns, and features a recessed target crown to protect the rifling. With quality optics, premium ammunition, and good shooting conditions, 1 MOA accuracy can be expected -- if you, your ammo and your optics are up to it. The fluted barrel allows us to give you a stiffer barrel profile that does not carry excessive weight. So the Extreme Weather SS feels very light but offers accuracy of a heavier rifle. Two stainless steel sling swivel studs are installed as expected. In fact, all major components are stainless to keep you gun looking and working well year after year in tough conditions. You will need to buy scope bases and rings to match your setup separately, so don't forget. (The scope and mounts in the photo above are not included.) The line-up of hunting calibers is more than adequate, taking you from crossover big game/varmint calibers to hard hitting magnum calibers sufficient for practically everything you could want to hunt: . . . whitetails, mule deer, elk, sheep, goats, bears, moose, etc. Check the blogs and you'll read how many consider it the perfect elk rifle.
Bell & Carlson makes a uniquely high-quality product. That is the reason Winchester Repeating Arms has teamed with them over the years to produce our finest specialty rifles. With features like a proprietary molding system that maximizes strength and one of the industry's most acclaimed aluminum bedding block designs (for a total lock from action to stock), you get superb accuracy, ideal balance and strength only possible with non-traditional stock engineering. The Extreme Weather does not have a traditional injected type stock. As per specifications developed by Bell and Carlson and Winchester Repeating Arms, the stocks are ""constructed using a 'hand lay-up' process, using a variety of composite materials. These composites -- including fiberglass, aramid fibers, graphite, epoxy gel coats and laminating resins; and polyurethane reinforcement with milled fiberglass -- provide a warm and solid feel rather than the hollow feel one gets from injection molded stocks."" The Extreme Weather stock is reliable over a temperature range of -50 degrees to +140 degrees Fahrenheit for extreme stability under any heat and cold conditions you might encounter around the world: Alaska to Arizona and beyond."

It has all the BCM bells and whistles you want to put on your fraken-AR but it came like that. The action is ridicuolously smooth, incredibly lightweight. With my ability, the CMC 3.5lb triger, my poor eyesight, and the Trijicon MRO I got it right around/under 1 MOA. This is the total package Rifle, Proctor sling, Proctor mount and light, Trijicon MRO lower 1/3 cowitness, steel Magpul MBUS Pro back up irons, CMC Trigger, I'll even throw in a solid rifle case with a few mags. Has BCM bolt carrier, BCM cold forged barrel. I don't know what else you could want on an AR15. Price Is pretty firm, do your research before making an offer. If you were to go buy this exact rifle off the shelf you would be into the mid $2,000s before you purchase a single round of ammo. This is quasi irrelevant because who only shoots their rifle a hundred times, has probably been shot 250rds, always took it to the range with my other rifle that has a magnified Trijicon optic that I much prefer.Only selling because I have the exact same rifle in a 16"" with a magnified optic."

Your barrel will be free floated in this stock. Fits Savage Short Action rifles with 4.4"" action screw spacing and the top bolt release. Includes 2 new action screws that came with the stock.I am the original owner, I bought everything brand new & have used it maybe 4-5 times. Buyer will pay shipping, approximately $25 for USPS priority, unless you want another service.There is a small chip in the front of the stock that is roughly 0.5"" x 0.5X and roughly 1/8"" deep. Does not effect performance or function, it is merely a cosmetic flaw that can be filled with epoxy, Brownells Acraglass, JB Weld, etc. Since there is this minor cosmetic flaw I am including oneMDT 10 round .308 AICS magazine with the stock and bottom metal, which has worked flawless. This magazine normally sells for $40 + shipping.
The stock was inletted for the bottom metal by CDI Precision Gunworks, so the inletting was done right. All Ihad to do was slip my Savage 10 FCP-SR action in, tighten the 2 action screws and that's it! Fits like a glove on the Savage 10 action.
Includes:*Choate Tactical stock - inletted by CDI Precision Gunworks*CDI Precision Gunworks AICS bottom metal, installed by CDI Precision Gunworks. Extended magazine release lever.*MDT 10 round .308WIN AICS magazine
The Tactical stock has a full length bedding block, adjustable spacer system to adjust the length of pull, rail on bottom of forend to attach a bipod and sling swivels on both sides. This stock takes the Savage factory short actions with or without accu-trigger. Action screw spacing of 4.4. There will be a small gap(3/16"" or less) under the safety on all the Savage Varmint, Tactical and Sniper stocks. The action should only touch on the V of the bedding block and back of the recoil lug. The gap at the back is normal for Savage actions when installed in our stocks.
