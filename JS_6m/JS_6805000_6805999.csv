It features a three position selector - Mode 1 for Safe Mode 2 for traditional semi-automatic Mode or Mode 3 for Binary Mode. In Binary Mode the firearm will discharge one round with every function of the trigger whether a pull or a release. A user can negate the round that would otherwise be fired during the release function by moving the selector back to Mode 2 and then safely releasing the trigger. Franklin Armory's BFS is easy to install with no custom fitting. The BFS Gen 3 offers a trigger pull of 4.5 lbs. (+/- 0.5 pound) the release phase now has a positive reset and an updated design eliminates backup disconnector. The stronger buffer spring (included) reduces the possibility of hammer follow. It works in Franklin Armory's F17 series in .17 WSM without modification. It works on .22LR and 9mm uppers without modification.

Just some additional info: I have been told when taken apart a Nambu, you may want to purchase a new set of recoil springs since you don't know when they were changed last time and save the originals for collect-ability reasons. New Nambu recoil springs on eBay are around $15.00. I didn't change them because i didn't think it needed them. I've never shot it myself, I find bullets are hard to find. I bought it just for collection, but love to shoot my ww11 collections also, but bullets are just hard to find.. I'm willing to trade for another ww11 firearm or sell outright.  Ship to your FFL or C&R $30.00 or just come by and pick up. (7/6/15) I took it my gun guy to give it a good look over and he said it in great shape, he also said it works just fine, by the sound of him cocking and firing it.  Few my other things for sale on armslist: Click listings by this user""IM NOT A DEALER, SO PLEASE IF YOU NEED IT SHIPPED, MAKE SURE THAT YOUR FFL WILL ACCEPT FROM A NON DEALER.If pick up, your state's drivers license to be copied and attached to a firearm bill of sale or if shipped to your/ FFL dealer only."

Most modern bolt actions are either copies or direct descendants of this legendary system. Features of the design include three bolt locking lugs for added safety and gas vents to vent dangerous hot gas away from shooters eyes in case of malfunction. The quality and work that went into these rifles really gives a peak into the old-world craftmanship that we dont see anymore.Pros:Shoots great and reliablyAction is still in the white and very smooth to operateBore is clean although the pictures maybe fuzzy (surprisingly difficult to photograph a rifle barrel clearly).Cons:Has acquired a petina with age (ripe for a restoration, would be a beautiful piece with a bit of TLC)Top handguard is crackedLight pitting around the action along where the woods meets the steelPriced to sell.

The open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping and allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.
FEATURES: Safeties:  ambidextrous safety on both sides of frame. 
 
Nicely visible, high profile white 3 dot sight system.
Rear sights are fully adjustable for windage and elevation. Loaded chamber indicator along side barrel.
Single and double action. Single action has a nice clean break -- it’s short, light (about five pounds) and crisp!
Real hammer fired – this is the classic hammer you can pull back with your thumb and actually feel and see firing the gun, a feature favored by many shooters as a more authentic shooting experience.
Breech-locking mechanism uses a Walther-style tilting locking block.
Construction: Steel barrel and slide.  Sturdy metal alloy frame.
5 inch barrel and military/ergonomic frame achieves legendary pointability and accuracy.
Recoil is very manageable. Strong, planted grip with checkered wood grips means that the recoil does not snap or kick  --  more of a ""push"" and really cushions the recoil.  Even shooters accustomed to a lighter round will be able to handle it very easily.
Full Pachmayr Signatur Grips have full checkering all around (360 degrees) for a secure grip.
Double stack, high capacity magazine.
Field stripping is a snap, using Beretta’s sure-footed, quick lever takedown that easily removes the slide from the frame. From there, the recoil spring, guide tube and barrel are easily removed.
Unbeatable Taurus lifetime warranty (transferrable to all subsequent owners).
**  The features, fit and finish of its more expensive cousins that it easily rivals. Note the absence of machine marks, a characteristic of higher end firearms.
Carry options:  Drop the hammer by thumbing the safety lever all the way down and carry it chambered, hammer down, off safe for a first double action shot.  You can also keep the safety on, then thumb it off with and have a first double action shot.  If you are a 1911 fan, then you can also carry cocked and locked which is the hammer cocked, safety on with a first shot being single action.
Includes high capacity magazine.

The only thing that needs finished up is to thread the barrel which is quite simple and only requires the purchase of the Correct thread tool, then this can be accomplished in minutes. This Rifle is complete with box, 3 30 Rd magazines, Cleaning kit, Cleaning Rod, and instruction booklet. I'm unsure who performed the work on this Rifle but it was fairly well executed especially with the level of skill required to replace the rear trunion. The Rifle functions well and everything looks good. The only flaw  is where the two rivets were replaced for the rear truinion. They don't quite match after being reblued which is to be expected and the only way to get a complete match is to reblued the entire rifle, also one of the rivets pushed out a small surrounding area around one of the rivets which is also not uncommon especially when using an air rivet tool. If it bothered anyone that much the small hump could be flattened but it didn't bother me as it's barely noticeable so I left it be. I will ship to an FFL anywhere in the lower 48 for $25. PayPal payment is preferred but I will accept money orders, cashiers checks, or personal checks with a waiting period to make sure it clears my bank. Those of you who know these rifles knows that the Bakelite stock set alone sells for around $800 and the last two to sell on Gunbroker brought over $3000 and they didn't have boxes or accessories so my price is very reasonable and is perfect for the person who wants one of these for their collection but doesn't want to spend $3000 plus.

I just don't use it as much as I had hoped. It comes with everything you see in the pictures. 7 arrows, 6 of which I paid $80 for and $50 for the three expanding broadheads. I don't have the release anymore. It has a truglo quiver that is very light, the hard shell case is yours too. There's a second set of broadheads that will come with it, they're fixed blades. The bow itself is extremely light and shoots fast! It has a dual hybrid cam system that enables you to adjust the draw length and weight without a bow press. I have it set to a 29"" draw and a 70lb pull. I don't remember the percentage of the let off, but I can hold it all day and I have a bum shoulder. I paid $900 for just the bow a few years ago, so with all the added supplies $500 is a good deal. If the ad is up, it's still available. However, it is cross posted. Thanks for your time."

My whole gun is shinier than your feed ramp! Super duper slickered up officer sized 1911 in .45 ACP. Please zoom in to the pictures. It's a mirror. All stainless but the trigger (aluminum). Gun alone was $575, Polish work (internals too) was $300 racks and shoots like a high end 1911. Very comfy leather holster was $49 (inside the waist, still new as only worn once) that has adjustable retention. The $100 Esmarelda grips are thinner than factory and are in a smooth, satin finish. Definitely improved the ergonomics with the grips. Also have two stainless Kimber mags with bumpers that were  $55 (factory one was junk and tossed). Total before tax, etc, etc just over $1k in it.  Nicest ATI Titan Stainless you will ever see. Will sell for $650 firm, firm, firm or see trades below.Includes afternarket hard case, 2 Kimber Mags, the gun and the holster. No shipping, face to face in Winter Park only. You must be a Florida Resident, at least 21 and not a convicted felon."
