I have documentation from the ATF verifying my Active Duty Military status allows this. Debating selling two of my AR-15s in order to get a Springfield M1A Scout. The bottom two ARs in the picture are the ones I am selling. I am away at work and this is the only picture I have on me. I can get more when I get home this weekend. The PSA has a Knight Arms quad rail with covers, Primary Arms Micro Dot with 1/3 co witness riser, Matech flip up rear sight, grip pod, and a 3 point sling. The Anderson has a free float rail and a 2X7 scope that I believe has the illuminating reticles if I am remembering correctly. I know what I have into the rifles so make me an offer you think is fair on price. The only trade I would consider is towards a Springfield M1A Scout.

It's a great optic but not exactly what I am looking for. I need more of a target scope this seems to be for competitions like run and gun. I have the box paperwork and all packing materials. Reticle is really cool - black, green, or red. controled by adjustable rotary nob. Red dot has a fixed 3x magnification Works with or without batteries reticle dots out to 600 yards. This is a great deal for a top quality scope. Also no question lifetime warranty through Burris.

Next morning, he sees it, cuts the carved part out, and puts a piece of a damn butter knife in it to replace the missing part. It doesn't affect the grip or the use of the gun in any way, it's just ugly. I got a brand new box of ammo to go with it.

This is HK’s top-of-the-line dual action / single action pistol. It has a 4.5 inch barrel. It comes with two 15 round magazines.
This configuration is the best model ever offered, because it will run either dual action or single action, has an external ambidextrous safety AND a decocker next to the hammer. You can find an HK without the safety, or without the decocker, but ones that are loaded like this one, are rare.
It can be carried with one in the chamber and decocked, or condition one with safety on and hammer back.
The sights are glow-in-the dark white dot night sights, which actually glow for a long time.
This one comes with the original HK case, 2 magazines, the different thickness grip back straps and side straps. I am the second owner and have the original receipt for when it was purchased by the original owner.
When I purchased it from the original owner, it came with an inside the waistband holster which was purported to be for a Glock 20 I think, so the fit isn’t perfect and I never used it.
The Streamlight TLR-2 light/laser combo is not included unless negotiated into the deal.  I plan on keeping it but could be convinced to sell/trade as part of a package (don't want to sell separately)
I plan on attending the Washington Arms Collector Show this weekend and could meet there.  I don't need to sell this gun and won't sell it super cheap, and FFL transfer will be required"

An Auto-Brightness sensor continuously samples lighting conditions to provide optimal reticle intensity, or can be overridden should the shooter prefer the manual mode. The exterior lens surfaces are treated with Leupold's DiamondCoat™ that adds abrasion resistance and durability, and assists in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast. The aspheric lens creates a wide field-of-view, with sharp image quality, allowing user to keep both eyes open and focused on the target. Slotted windage and elevation dials allow positive 1 MOA adjustments without the need of lock screws. The Leupold DeltaPoint Pro Reflex Sight is constructed with a lightweight aluminum housing, shrouded in spring steel for maximum durability, and has been waterproof tested to 66 feet.

Browning Micro Midas firearms are designed specifically for smaller framed shooters. If you give a new shooter a long gun that is too large for them, they will develop bad habits in their form as they are doing everything they can just to hold the barrel up and get some kind of sight picture. The Micro Midas BPS shaves off weight and length (which can be adjusted with included stock spacers), creating a more compact and easy to handle package. As the name Micro Midas implies, this BPS is not another cheap ""junior model"" shotgun. The satin finish Walnut wood stock is as beautiful as it is functional, with detailed checkering on the pistol grip and fore arm. The vented rib barrel and the forged, machined steel receiver are gloss blued. The barrel is every bit the same quality as a full size Browning BPS, made with the Total Barrel Dynamics system, including Invector Plus chokes for the 12 and 20 gauge models and Standard Invector chokes for the other gauges. Displayed images are stock photos. Any questions please feel free to ask. Thanks and happy bidding."

A favorite of many hunters and shooters, the Short Rifle has always been fast to the shoulder, quick-swinging, lightweight and a pleasure to shoot. It was a favorite of the range rider who could snatch it from his saddle scabbard and fire faster than prairie lightning. The new Winchester Model 94 Short Rifle has a compact 20"" deeply-blued round barrel and a straight grip walnut stock. It has a rifle-style forearm, black grip cap and a full-length magazine. It’s drilled and tapped for scope mounts, and a hammer spur extension is included with the rifle. The sights are traditional with a semi-buckhorn rear and a Marble Arms gold bead at the muzzle. With the new Short Rifle Model 94 there’s a lot of fun waiting in the saddle, in the field or at the range. I can ship it with state."
