All other pocket holsters do, is hold the gun inside your pocket.The KRAMER Pocket Holster does all the things you expect a good pocket holster to do. It ensures the gun will stay in the same place inside your pocket, stops the front sight from wearing a hole in your pocket, prevents the flutes on a revolver's cylinder from cutting painfully into your body, ensures the gun will not be wrapped in a wad of pocket material when you go to grab it to defend your life. AND it also disquises the shape of the gun as seen through the pocket.The body out side of the holster is covered with a piece of plastic laminate that breaks up the outline of the gun, so the tell-tale bulge inside your pocket looks like a wallet. The side of the holster pressing against your body is smooth, comfortable, precisely molded horsehide.Website Price: $99.00"

Obviously looking for a good condition firearm, serial number cannot be scratched off or anything that can be deemed illegal and so it must be fully intact, etc. Preferably a gun purchased from a gun shop with papers, etc. and could do a bill of sale or whatever you want. As long as it's all legal and good and I know it can vary by county (I believe) but I'll tell you right now I've never been arrested for anything in my life, period. I'm a FL resident with FL driver's license, etc. Can make offer depending on the model and accessories such as mags, etc., but assuming it's standard with the box it came in and 2 mags, etc. and papers, am looking at $550 cash.

I have always been an EOTech guy, but some friends talked me into getting this rig for my new build. Short story, is just not for me. The sight and magnifier were mounted once and never used (It's being sitting on my built since I bought it three weeks ago). Comes with the Aimpoint tool (tool and battery cap have a little scratch from me trying to tight the battery cover, lens cover, manual, warranty papers, original boxes, and everything that comes with it from the factory. The magnifier is mounted in a Larue Tactical QD Pivot Mount-Tall for Aimpoint Magnifier, LT755. The mount itself retails for $162 and is also like new with no marks other than the bottom which is from my upper receiver. The only reason that I'm not listing this as new is because I opened and mounted it on my upper receiver, and I learned the hard way that when you open something is not new anymore. Also, understand that the Larue Mount will set about 1/3 higher (refer to pics; pics were taken from Larue Tactical); however, this will not affect sight picture. Aimpoint Micro comes with the LRP Mount/39mm Spacer Box. I'm also open to trades for EOTech (New Gen) with Magnifier (G33). I spent more than $850 for this setup, so I'm just selling it so I can buy me the Eotech set. No international shipping. Shipping will be insured, and tracking number will be added. Open to offers. You can txt me at REDACTED. Thanks for looking. Aimpoint Micro H-1 4MOA Unique Features:-Lightweight – 84 g without mount and 105 g with mount-Integral Weaver-style base allows easy attachment-ACET technology allows 50,000 hours of operation on one battery-Fully waterproof-Patent pending mount is keyed to the sight body to absorb recoil-Precision adjustment for windage and elevation: top of protective caps fits into holes on adjustment screws – no other tool required12 settings for use in daylight and low-light conditionsAimpoint 3X-C Unique Features:The Aimpoint® 3X-C was developed for the civilian end user and can be used in conjunction with all Aimpoint® sights for long-range aiming or observation. A variable (-2 to +2) dioptric setting allows this magnifier to be adapted to the individual shooter’s eye.The 3X-C can also be used as a handheld 3X monocular. Aimpoint magnifiers utilize the red dot in Aimpoint sights as the aiming reticle, eliminating the need for re-zeroing when shifting between non-magnified and magnified aiming.The 3X-C is encased in a shock absorbing protective rubber cover that also creates an ideal ergonomic grip. Internal optical adjustments make aligning the magnifier and sight quick and easy."

I only took it out of the box and turned it on for pictures. If you know what this is, you know how awesome it would be for hog, coyote or any other type of hunting. It zeroes to your scope reticle so from now on whatever you see through your crosshairs is what you are ranging. It comes with all accessories, including the momentary switch, lense covers, batteries and sight-in reflectors. It can run as a momentary scan or can be placed in constant scan mode so it will range whatever you look at. They (Silencerco) claim it will run in constant scan for up to 12 hours on a single set of batteries. These typically sell for $950-1,000, but you can have this one for $750obo, which is what I would end up getting back after shipping and restocking fees were deducted.

I purchased this from SOG about a month ago, cleaned it up, took it out, and didn't like it. It shoots great, I just didn't like the feel of the gun or the Tokarev round. I purchased this as a hand select, so it's one of the more cosmetically appealing M57s that SOG had on hand.This is a surplus M57, not a new production, and qualifies as C&R. As a result, the bluing has some scratches and dings, but overall the metal and finish are in quite good condition for a surplus gun. The Yugo crest is immaculate, and the rifling is strong with a shiny bore. Half-cock and full-cock both work just fine. The gun does have a safety that was presumably installed by the Zastava factory, but as with most of the Yugo Tokarev imports, it's not very good. The gun comes with one surplus 9-round magazine (which I also cleaned).Price is firm. Cash only, with one exception: I will trade for a CZ-82, and will consider paying cash on top of the M57 if we do trade. (Yes, I doubt anyone will take me up on it, but just in case there's someone out there looking to pick up a Yugo M57 and offload a CZ-82, I'm your guy.)Buyer will be required to fill out a bill of sale. No exceptions. (And you will receive a copy from me as well, should you want it.)"

Trigger Pull – 0.5-4 lbs. (Customer Choice)   Please allow 5-9 weeks for shipping   The overall premise of this rifle is a custom built, application specific rifle. Due to the significantly reduced weight of the chassis, and the accuracy capabilities, this rifle has tremendous long range hunting capabilities. The customer chooses his caliber and chamber, along with the length and contour of the barrel. These choices will be determined by the application for the rifle. If you plan on packing the rifle for extended ranges on foot, then a lighter contour would be appropriate. However, if plans include using a muzzle brake or suppressor, the muzzle diameter needs to be large enough to provide a shoulder for the “end of barrel” device to attach and locate. If you are focused more on velocity and extended thermal stability of the barrel, then a longer, heavier contour may be appropriate. Refer to the contour chart on the “Precision Rifle Barrels” page on our website. All chassis and barrels are cerakoted, and we provide a multitude of colors and patterns. Solid colors are included. Custom patterns have a +$150 upcharge. The length of pull and cheek riser position are adjustable and locked in position with a series of set screws that are embedded into the buttstock body. This is the same system we use on our standard BA chassis, but without the thumb wheels. The adjustable monopod can be added to this chassis, along with the bag rider plate. Trigger type and pull are also important considerations. We offer either the Rifle Basix L1 (1.5-4lbs) and the LV1 (8 oz to 2 lbs) as our standard triggers. Just pick the trigger pull you want. We also can provide the rifle with other aftermarket triggers. Timney, Jewel, Huber and others. Just let us know if you have a preference other than Rifle Basix. Triggers other than our standard will include an upcharge depending on the trigger."

An interchangeable backstrap allows the grip to be customized to the shooter’s hand.

Projectile: good condition, dated 1968. Believed to be original paint. Copper rotating band has a demill chisel mark, and is in good condition otherwise. 1968 dated are sought after by collectors. Case: the lacquered steel spiral wrap M14B4 that was prevalent, not brass. 1974(75?) dated. 90 percent of the casings during Vietnam were the spiral wrap- historically correct. Case is dinged up alittle at the mouth at the demill ( see pictures, the one with the rotating band chisel mark) and has been fired.For display purposes, the projectile fits fine in the shell, it displays well with the demilled band facing rear. Very minor surface rust in spots,no dents, overall OK condition, hard to find these war dated as they rusted out years ago. Fuze: an M78 CP ( concrete piercing, bunker buster) dated 1945. Red legs from Vietnam have told me they had used WW2 dated fuzes, and cases early on-historically correct. Black fiber PA74 shipping tube: dated 1974, these are very, very hard to find. The projo and case fit nicely in the tube. Crate: wooden crate is not Vietnam era, but the LOT number ( KN-900-2B) is very close to the tube number ( KN-815-45). Size: wooden crate is 38""x12"". All in all, THE perfect gun room addition, this one has sat opened, up against my loading room wall for years, the real deal...time to move it along. Complete 105mm sets like these have long ago disappeared. Note: I will ship, however, I estimate it to be just under 100 lbs."

My loss is your gain!Introduced in 1961, the Model 500 pump action utilizes an aluminum alloy receiver. The gun has a number of desirable features, including a barrel that is fully interchangeable, an easily manipulated top of receiver mounted safety, an anti jam elevator, dual extractors, and twin action bars for smooth and reliable operation. Model #50521 is a 6 shot with an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel, parkerized finish and includes a pistol grip kit.
Specifications and features:
Mossberg Special Purpose pump shotgun 12 gauge3"" chamber18.5"" barrel5+1 2 3/4"", 4+1 3"" round capacityAmbidextrous thumb safetyTwin action barsAnti jam elevatorDual extractors1 1/2"" drop at comb2 1/8"" drop at heelBlack synthetic stockIncludes rear pistol gripParkerized finish39 1/2"" overall length6 3/4 lbs.
Extras include a lock, a rubber butt plate with screws, a plastic full stock, one rear pistol grip that replaces the stock, one larger generic AR15 grip, and one smaller Troy Industries CQB Battle Axe AR15 grip.
In addition, I added a Mesa Tactical LEO Full Recoil buffer kit with AR style collapsible stock! This thing is bad ass and you can shoot slugs all day long with no fatigue! Mesa Tactical states a 70% reduction in recoil, and it sure does make a difference!
I paid about $820.00 to set up this package.Mossberg shotgun was about $425.00 Mesa Tactical LEO Recoil buffer was about $365.00Troy Industries CBQ Battle Axe Ar15 style grip was about $30.00Ill let it go for $599.00 and Ill throw in a free shotgun barrel cleaner! If you arent interested in purchasing, dont bother emailing me your opinions on my firearm, price or whatever. I dont give a shit and wont respond. Thanks for looking!"
