Per S&W, you get 5 rounds of .38 +P with S&W's factory Crimson Trace laser grips.  Easily carried in a purse or pocket at only 15oz, you have a FAR more potent self defense round than the popular .380 pistols without carrying more weight or bulk. The intuitive laser grip is turned on as you grip the pistol to fire; no fumbling for an 'on' button when there may be high stress.  S&W quality speaks for itself and in the roughly 100 rounds I've put through this pistol, there obviously hasn't been a single issue. The only reason I am selling this pistol is because I have the similar version that fires both .38 and .357 magnum in both S&W and Ruger. I don't really need three pistols that do the same thing. Also, the .38 Special rounds are easy to fire out of this small pistol. The .357 magnum rounds just flat out hurts to shoot out of these light weight pistols. I'll probably just load .38 +P in the other two I have, so this little 642 is all you need. This pistol sells for right at $600 right now as configured. This slightly used one is a steal at only $425!  Buyer must meet me in person and have valid Indiana ID and preferably an Indiana concealed carry permit. Comes in factory box with all original paperwork and lock."

In January 1865, the United States government contracted with Rogers & Spencer for 5,000 of the solid frame pistols. Delivery on the contract was made too late for war service, and the entire lot was sold as scrap to Francis Bannerman and Son in 1901. Bannerman then sold the pistols throughout the first quarter of the 20th Century. Many original Rogers & Spencer revolvers are seen today in excellent, near mint condition. The Rogers and Spencer Army Model Revolver was actually an improvement of earlier pistols produced by the firm - the Pettingill and Freeman revolvers. The Pettingills were produced in the late 1850's and early 1860's, and were double action revolvers. The Pettingills were ahead of their time, being designed as hammerless pistols, which were popular in the last decade of the 19th Century, but certainly too avant garde for Army purchasers. The Navy Model was a .34 caliber, of which less than 1,000 were produced. The Army Model was a .44 caliber, and only about 3,400 were produced in the early 1860's. The Freeman Army Model Revolver was a solid frame .44 caliber pistol with a round 7 1/2"" barrel, of which 2,000 are believed to have been produced in 1863-64, and in appearance the Freeman resembles a Starr Revolver. The Rogers & Spencer is an improved Freeman, with a less severe grip style, a heavier frame and a stronger octagon barrel of identical 7 1/2"" length. Interestingly, the Rogers & Spencer design is eligible for N-SSA competitions because the contract was consummated before the end of hostilities. The current reproduction of the Rogers & Spencer Army Model Revolver was produced in Italy by Euroarms.FEATURES:Strong, accurate, solid frame design, precision barrel.Extra large nipple cut-out on rear of cylinder for ease of capping.Manufactured from the finest modern steel.Machined to precision tolerances.Finished with Euroarms of America's deep, rich, high gloss blueing.Unique flared grips are of select quality walnut superbly finished.LOading lever assembly and cylinder are easily removed for cleaning by half turn of retaining screw.SPECIFICATIONS:Caliber: .44 Percussion.Barrel Length: 7 1/2 inches.Sights: Integral rear sight notch groove in frame, truncated cone front sight of brass.Overall Length: 13-3/4 inchesWeight: 47 ouncesRecommended Ball Diameter: .451 round or conical, pure lead.Percussion Cap size: number 11LOCAL - AZ only.

The previous owner has had several G20 over the years and some how this one has a G4 frame and a G3 Slide so the frame and slide numbers no longer match. This does not impair the operation of the weapon but I want people to know before buying. It comes with case, backstraps, and 2 magazines.Of the 10 mm pistols I've had the opportunity to work with, the G20 is the softest shooting. The accuracy is excellent, especially for an out-of-the-box service pistol. The new Gen4 version G20 is more comfortable to work with for smaller hands than the Gen3 because of the reduced grip size, grip texturing and the enlarged magazine release. As one of those shooters who enjoys handguns with plenty of power, this version of the G20 has earned itself a place on my list of favorite gun tests of the year.

This pistol has tritium night sights aswell I can throw in a iwb holster and some defensive ammo also. I'm looking for a decent quality ar15 (psa freedom rifles would be first on my list but I would also be interested in other entry level ar's too). My pistol goes for around $500+ out the door w/ night sights. I know there's someone out there who has a couple of extra rifles that they wouldn't mind getting rid of one. I can add $ for the right deal. Thanks for looking have a good one.
