Magpul has released mags for the G19 and the G17 for the last few years with great success and a few months ago they released 12 round extended pinky mags for the G26 (which is freaking nice since glock wants $30-$38 PER 12 round OEM mag + shipping online, $40 in stores). ANYWHOO, I've got 2 for my G26 and love them, I want a bunch more as they're a SHITLOAD easier to dissassemble and clean than the Glock factory mags (whoever invented the takedown procedure for glock needs to be shot) and can get them for a killer deal if I order in bulk. Normally they're $15.95 or $15.15 being the lowest I've seen + shipping for the mags.... I gotta order about 16 of them at a time to get them down to about $13.35 INCLUDING shipping per magazine and don't need ALL of them. I plan on keeping 10 and don't need 16. if anyone wants to get in on that deal with me I'll gladly sell them to you at my cost in pairs of three (for ease of sales, so I'm not passing out 1 or 2 at a time)... so basically, $40 for 3 brand new G216 pmag's (12 rounders), or $80 for all 6 ... if anyone wants to take the extras off my hands when they come in, I'll gladly take names and let you know when they come in."

The Micro Comp only adds about .45″ to the end of your threaded barrel. Our comp was designed for the Glock 19 and when installed will fit in all Glock 34/35 holsters. Although the comp was designed around the Glock 19, it will work very well with any 9mm Glock and will function with any open ended holsters in the event the gun is longer than the holster."

I am looking to trade for a very nice bolt action rifle in 308 or 300 winmag. I may possibly trade for an AR15 (5.56), if it is an exceptionally nice rifle. When offering trades, please consider that this rifles msrp is $2489. I have copied and pasted Seekins decription below.
After two years of tireless development and testing, Seekins Precision has introduced the SP10 308, our large frame AR of unrivaled quality, accuracy and performance.
Based on the excellent and proven iRMT upper receiver, CNC machined from 7075-T6 billet aluminum, the top Picatinny rail extends over the barrel mount to strengthen the receiver and provide more space to mount optics. Coupled with the receiver is the Seekins Precision SP3R free float handguard. Flat on the bottom, the SP3R aids stability for precision shooting. The stainless steel match-grade barrel and a Intermediate gas system is specifically contoured to balance the rifle for superior handling performance and weight reduction.
The Seekins Precision mission of unrivaled innovation and performance drove the development of the lower receiver. Also machined from 7075-T6 billet aluminum, the SP10 308 is fully ambidextrous due to superior weapon controls such as the magazine release, selector switch and ambidextrous bolt switch that allows the shooter to lock back or release the bolt with a single finger. Accuracy demands an excellent trigger and the SP10 308 delivers with a 3.5 tuned fire control that guarantees out of the box performance. The proprietary buffer system is housed in a carbine length tube and is fitted with a Magpul STR stock. The SP10 308 is the pinnacle of large frame AR development. Premium features and components come standard to increase accuracy, functionality and reliability. The SP10 308 is hard coat anodized matte black."

First is a 1984 Colt MKIV Series 80 Officer ACP, with original wilson combat sights.The model number is 09085 This is the smaller framed 1911 with the 3.5 barrel and feautures a decocker, when the trigger is squeezed with the safety on, then the safety is turned off it will drop the hammer to decock it. The gun is in good shape, Cabelas here in garner said its 90%. It shoots great and is really a great feeling 1911. I bought this from the original owner who bought it in 1986.

I purchased this about a month ago from guns unlimmited in ayden for right at 800 after tax. The Shotgun has a few marks on the barrel from being kept on white wooden shelves in the gun store. Besides a few light scuffs its in great shape and only had a little over 25 rounds through her. It comes with the oringal box and 5 choke tubes and a nice Limb Saver Air Tech recoil pad on it. Asking 575 cash or 650 trade. Ive recently begun shooting skeet a lot and need to get a more suited shotgun for it. Im open to a multiple gun trade for a higher quality shotgun.

The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G19 Gen4 9x19mm retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments. Also available in MOS configuration.The Glock 19 Modular Optic System (MOS)The MOS models come from the factory with a slot milled out of the top of the slide just forward of the rear sight dovetail. The slot is just about two inches long and maybe 3/16 inches deep if you remove the cover and included optics mounting plates. The gun comes with a “cover” plate installed which basically fills this gap completely, so at a glance, the Glock 19 MOS looks like a regular Glock 19 Gen 4 model, except for the visible seams. To mount an optic directly to the slide, you simply remove the cover plate and replace it with one of four included adapter plates. These plates are clearly numbered one to four and are cut with posts and holes specific to a variety of optics mounting systems"
