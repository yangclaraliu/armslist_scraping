The rifle is in great shape, the barrel has a 1919 stamp on it, and the SN has a date of manufacture around mid 1919. This means it is double heat treated and thus capable of handeling new ammunition pressures. The rifle is over all in amazing shape and i can say that he rifle will come with an original sling and 80 rounds of ammo.the rifle has been professionally tapped on a side note, so if you feel the need it can have a scope attached. Ok so I know you're thinking that this is a bit much for a 1903. On the contrary a mark 1 in stock configuration is a rare rifle indeed, again you may say not if it is tapped, the 80 rounds of ammo offset close to 100$ and besides the tapping it is in perfect stock configuration. And it's value unlike your modern rifle will only increase in value. So please feel free to text me, REDACTED names Ian."

XL650 with casefeeder, powder check, bullet tray, strong mount, and aluminum roller handle. Set up for 9mm with 9mm conversion and Lee 9mm 4-die set (conversion and dies can be separated if not desired - see below). Includes extras: XL650 spare parts kit, Uniquetek micrometer, shellplate bearing kit, primer flip tray, extra primer pickup tubes, extra lockrings, 1"" bench wrench, Dillon case lube, DIY ""no more feed"" bars, manual. The press is several years old and runs well - see video clip below. As you are probably aware, Dillon is well known for its ""No BS"" warranty, and Dillon also offers a refurbishment service - send them the press and $78 and they'll tear it down and completely overhaul the press and ship it back to you (google reviews for this, it's a pretty amazing service).Armslist limits ads to 3 pics, so just email me for any other pics you'd like to see.Press is currently set up for 9mm, so that means small powder bar, small primer system, 9mm conversion kit, small pistol casefeed plate. And of course it comes with large primer system parts and large powder bar.Here it is in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX3S1sdKcfcSorry about the camera autofocus moving in and out. You'll notice there is slight movement in the press - I have it mounted to a Black & Decker Workmate and while it works surprisingly well, mounting to a more heavy duty workbench would be superior, especially if the workbench is screwed into wall studs or the ground. I was using this in an apartment, so bolting the Workmate into walls or floor was not an option for me.Dillon XL650 attachments (these are all very popular attachments):* casefeeder with small pistol plate * powder check * strong mount * bullet tray * aluminum roller handleModifications made:* primer ski jump fix - the unused primer catch tray functions (unintentionally) as a ski jump, which is a great way to jump live primers onto your floor. This is a well known issue and the fix I used is pretty common - vinyl tubing stops the primers from leaping to freedom and captures them. Just twist off the end cap and dump primers into flip tray (or primer filler machine) - even apart from flying primers, this mod makes it a lot easier to empty the primers than trying to scoop the primers out of that little catch try with a finger. * spent primer catch - another well known issue where spent primers can miss the catch, leaving you with spent primers on your bench. Plus you have to empty the small catch pretty frequently. The mod I made is very common - replace the catch with some vinyl tubing. You can then run the tubing into a large bottle or similar - so instead of frequently emptying a small catch, you'll have the spent primers collect in a much larger container, which might take months or years to fill up (at which point you can sell it for brass value). Original catch is included. * shellplate thrust bearing kit - it's a common solution to the issue of the shellplate indexing to a sudden stop, which can cause powder spillage (which sucks both because it creates a mess that will require cleaning up before it starts preventing cases from fully seating in the shellplate, and because you're not getting the desired powder charge). With the thrust bearings, the shellplate bolt can be tightened down a little farther and the shellplate will glide smoothly into the index position rather than suddenly stop as the ball detent 'snaps' the shellplate into the index position, which prevents powder spillage (I realize this may be confusing if you've never used a Dillon progressive, but bottomline is it's a popular and inexpensive way to reduce powder spillage). * casefeeder support tube cut down by 1"" - the casefeeder was too tall to fit under a shelf, so I cut an inch off the bottom (the straight part of the tube). No effect on function. Could be cut down farther if necessary to fit under a shorter shelf - and if you're getting a progressive press, you'll want some nearby storage space!Extras:* Uniquetek Micrometer - very handy time saving gadget. Currently installed on the small powder bar. Makes changing the charge a simple twist of the dial to the micrometer setting corresponding to the desired charge. Beats the hell out of adjusting/weighing/adjusting/weighing/etc. each time you change loads. Read more about it here: http://uniquetek.com/product/T1231 * primer flip tray - unless you have the automated primer filler, you'll need a flip tray. I suppose you could do without one, but I guarantee turning over primers by hand will have you contemplating suicide. * extra primer pickup tubes and tips - the press comes with 1 small and 1 large primer pickup tube. You need more. You aren't buying a progressive press because you want to load only 100 rounds (capacity of pickup tube) at a time. * Dillon XL650 spare parts kit - nothing worse than a small part breaking during a loading session and having to stop and wait until Dillon sends you a replacement part. With the small parts kit, you just replace the part, and continue loading. Then contact Dillon at your convenience and they'll send you a replacement for free and you toss that in the spare parts kit. Also includes a few other spare parts. * I made some DIY ""no more feed"" bars from round bar stock. Some guy on ebay sells these for $20: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Dillon-reloader-650-xl-press-upgrade-shell-and-primer-No-More-Feed-BARS-/REDACTED26?hash=item41afeff0f2:g:ayMAAOSwQItT9UpE Useful for stopping the flow of cases and/or primers, e.g., you have a bunch of already primed cases (e.g., from pulled rounds) you want to work into your loading session. * nearly full container of Dillon caselube  * extra lockrings - the toolhead on the press has 5 lockrings, and you'll need 5 lockrings for each additional toolhead you set up * Dillon 1"" bench wrench - used to tighten lockrings (regular 1"" wrenches are too large to fit - not much free real estate on a fully loaded toolhead) * spare Dillon conversion kit box - can use to store small parts * Lee 9mm carbide 4-die setThe new cost of this setup is ~$1200 before shipping or tax. Asking $950. * ~$1080 for the Dillon items (see screenshot of shopping cart) * ~$120 for the micrometer, 9mm dies and shellplate bearing kit * extra stuff: a few large primer pickup tubes, a few lockrings, ""no more feed"" bars, spare conversion kit boxItems I will separate if not desired by press purchaser (these are not for sale separately until after the press sells); take this amount off the price of the press package:* primer flip tray and 4 small primer pickup tubes - $40 * Uniquetek micrometer - $45 * Lee 9mm 4-die set - $35 * XL650 9mm conversion kit - $55No trades, cash only."

The old saying that ""They don't make them like this anymore"" certainly holds true when you compare this knife to the cheaply made Chinese, Indian, and Pakistani knives being offered by American names today.
This knife is in excellent shape for its age and does not appear to have been used much:  Mirror-finished blade is full and appears unsharpened since the factory. Bevels are even and have zero nicks, chips, or cracks. Some light staining spots (not rust or pitting) scattered throughout. Tang stamped ""KA-BAR Reg. U.S. Pat. Off."" on left side. Leather stacked-ring handle is tight and in excellent shape, with brass half-handguard and intermittent brass and red and black Nylon spacers to a brushed aluminum pommel with brass key.
Sheath is full-grain leather with some minor signs of use and surface oxidation of the rivets but all stitching intact and no rips or tears. Leather is still supple and pliable.
Blade is 3 3/8 inches long; overall length of knife is 6 3/4 inches. A light compact, knife, it would be an excellent carry knife for field dressing deer or general all-around camp use.
All in all, a beautiful vintage knife in great shape, ready for the field or for your Ka-bar collection.
