I am selling the Combat as it's the most durable, newest, highest value and I need some funds after buying the other 3!! Please note the combat is not a normal P226. It has a coating to protect it from the elements, night sites, and is built for action. Now I put ""quality"" up in the title... why you might ask as I just described it as a quality firearm. Well if you google sig sauers you'll learn some people have mixed reviews on the sigs made over the past decade or so (go ahead! should always research before you buy). Well I've put upwards of 1000 rounds through this. I cleaned it as soon as I got it to take off factory, then shot it a ton to break it in, then thoroughly cleaned it and have kept it in impeccable shape. With 1000 rounds through it, I haven't experienced a single failure, and several people have shot it, none of them experienced a failure. So this is a quality made new Sig. You can see in the photo how well maintained it is - the barrel is still shinny and looks brand new new (oh it's a chrome lined barrel - again the P226 combat is not your normal P226). I'm going to miss it but as I said I've got too many sigs. A new one, with tax, will set you back over $1300 and you need to wait through the breakin period yet. Prices to sell at $1060."

I never gave the 770 a second look until I took this guy in on trade, from afar they just plain seemed cheesy. I really like the trigger pull, for Remingtons base rifle it impressed me. In case your wondering why I'm getting rid of a rifle that I like so well, holidays coming up so if I want a different toy something has to go on the chopping block. If I didn't already have a Weatherby Vanguard in 300 WSM that fit my needs to a T I would certainly keep it and sacrifice something else."

If you haven’t heard of the 22TCM pistol here is some more info on the gun from the manufactures website. “Famous for mastering the development of the 1911 platform for over 30 years, we've advanced the scope of our research and engineering team with the commercial launch of the meteoric 22 TCM cartridge in the 1911 format. Delivering over 2000 fps in a handgun while offering both single stack and high capacity options, the TCM series introduces the most potent and versatile 1911 in the market today. It's known for light recoil without sacrifice in muzzle energy and penetrating impact abilities. Also built in mid size, full size and high capacity options with both Standard and Tactical configurations, each TCM series handgun includes a drop-in 9mm barrel adding another proven ammunition option in one firearm. Once you rule the fire breathing dragon, you'll never want to put it down.” http://armscor.com/firearms/tcm-series/"

I bought this rifle in Feb 2016. I have less than 60 rounds shot through it. It has standard 308 threads for mounting a suppressor. I still have the box and paper work that it came with. It looks like brand new. I also added a rail system to mount a scope that retails for 90 dollars. MSRP for the rifle is 1199 with out a rail mounting system. The scope in the picture is not included. This is not a scam. For some reason it was flagged as one though this is my first listing on Arms list."

Ruger is proud to introduce the new Ruger LCP II. Since its original introduction in 2008, the LCP has set the industry standard for compact, reliable .380 Auto pistols. Rather than rest on that accomplishment, Ruger has built upon that solid performance to produce the new, best-in-class LCP II pistol. The LCP II features a short, crisp, single-action trigger with inner trigger safety, improved sights for superior visibility, a larger grip surface for better distribution of recoil forces and an easy-to-rack slide with an improved slide stop mechanism with a last round hold-open. With its compact size (just 5.17"" long and 3.71"" tall), this new lightweight compact pistol comes with a pocket holster and is designed to fit a variety of holsters and concealed carry options. Weighing in at just 10.6 ounces and equipped to hold 6+1 rounds of powerful .380 Auto ammunition, the LCP II is the ideal back-up gun - compact and light enough that you never have to leave it at home. The American-made LCP II is built on a rigid, one-piece, precision-machined, anodized aluminum chassis with integral frame rails and fire control housing. Additional features include rugged construction with a through-hardened alloy steel slide; a black, one-piece, high-performance, glass-filled nylon grip frame; a textured grip frame to provide a secure and comfortable grip; a finger grip extension floorplate that can be added to the magazine for comfort and more secure grip, and a blued, alloy steel barrel. The LCP II ships with one 6-round magazine. Note: Six-round LCP® magazines are compatible with the LCP® II, but will not activate the last round hold-open feature of the LCP® II. Seven-round LCP® magazines are NOT compatible with the LCP® II. Firearm Features  Short, crisp, single-action trigger pull.

Shipping is $10.00.I have a batch of HBAR AR-15 barrels intended to provide compliance with Maryland law. Heavy barrels for AR-15s are uncommon already, but these barrels are truly a rare item as they are marked HBAR right on the barrel itself. Only HBAR AR-15s are legal to buy or build in Maryland, but the legal definition of a HBAR is vague, so pick up one of our HBAR-marked barrels to put your gun in compliance beyond a shadow of a doubt.
 
These barrels have the barrel extension installed and headspaced, ready for assembly into your upper receiver. This can easily be done yourself, or by any gunsmith. No sights or gas block are included so this can be built into anything.
 Barrels are by Wilson.
Specs:

5.56 NATO chambering
16"" barrel length
Carbine gas system
1/2x28 threaded muzzle
.750"" gas block shoulder
Nitrided bore
M4 barrel extension (feed ramps)
 
H-BAR mark is located on top of barrel.

 

I have very limited stock of these special-order barrels, and I can only get them in from time to time. Grab yours today."

These barrels have the barrel extension installed and headspaced, ready for assembly into your upper receiver. This can easily be done yourself, or by any gunsmith. No sights or gas block are included so this can be built into anything.Barrels are by Wilson.

-refinished stock
-counter bored but very good rifling (shoots straight)
-numbers matching
bought this from a young fellow and it was having a severe rimlock problem as well as a very sticky bolt. I went through each piece, polished the chamber, bolt, replaced the interrupter with a one piece interrupter, shimmed the magazine and replaced magazine. Now this rifle runs so smooth, no jamming whatsoever, no rimlock. It does have one barrel band spring missing but I use a zip tie and it works fine (see photos, center photo).
-bolt completely polished by hand, no burrs, very smooth and chrome like finish ( lower left photo)
-one piece interrupter also comes with 2 two piece interrupters and extra magazine
-includes an original Mosin Sling NOT a cheap Chinese knock off
-includes a cleaning kit with ALL pieces as well as 2 cleaning brushes that work with the Mosin Cleaning Rod, these are very hard to come by
-Includes a Howling Raven Muzzle Brake which reduces felt recoil as well as making the rifle look cool
-comes with an ammo pouch and cleaning rod (no bayonet)
-blueing in good condition
Overall a VERY GOOD SHOOTER
