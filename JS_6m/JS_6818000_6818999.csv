I have built two of these with the intention of building this one into a 22-inch 6.5 Creedmoor variation.

I know it was for me.  I feel like I can scratch this off my bucket list and pass it on for someone else to have fun at a nice savings.  
 
Gun does not have a scratch on it, optics are flawless, and everything is as it would be new out of the box.. there are no dissapointments or surprises on this, period.  Comes with all original accessorires and Carry case.  I can throw in 3 boxes of .50BMG ammo ($100 value) also to the buyer.  
 
Please, serious inquires only.  Not interested in any trades.  Price is very reasonalbe for what you get, if you went to buy a 20"" version with this Cerakote you'd be in at over $8K.  
 
Price is $6900 FIRM FIRM..   That's over a $1K savings and about all I am willing to discount this.  You can get a 29"" cheaper than a 20"", you can get black cheaper, etc., but this is a premium gun and the way I see it you should get what you want or wait until you can.  No need to tell me what you can get for cheaper, I've shopped these and I already know this is a fair deal.  
 
Thanks for looking and I hope to find a buyer that will appreciate this rifle!"

I took it apart and cleaned, polished and lubed all surfaces. Have put about 50 #6, 25 #00, 25 #4 Buck and 25 Slugs through it. It now operates fast and smooth and throws the slugs with unexpected accuracy. I added a clip on fiber optic front sight.
