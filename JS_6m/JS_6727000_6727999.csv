The exact number of Model 1866 Rifles produced (modified) is not entirely clear although the estimate is only around 25,000. When the Model 1866 was eventually replaced a few years later with the US Model 1868 Rifle, most of the existing Model 1866 Rifles were purchased by the Remington Arms Company and were resold to the French for use during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871. While some of these rifles made it back to the United States over the years, the majority did not, making the Model 1866 a historically significant and very scarce example of American military firearms design. Rates Good to Very Good condition, especially for being 154 years old, and is probably one of the best you will find! Amazing to think this rifle, as a musket, was quite possibly used in the Civil War! Very sharp markings on barrel, breechblock, and has (2) inspector cartouches on left side of stock. Very fine example of an early AMERICAN military rifle! See photos. Layaway available. Contact me to discuss options. No FFL required. I ship directly to you once copy of driver's license is received to verify age. $50 flat fee Ground shipping. As with all antique weapons, an inspection by a gunsmith is recommended before attempting to fire."

Still chambered in the original 7.65x53 Argentine. All matching #'s except the bolt though the bolt is only about 20 numbers off and still in the same K serial prefix. No import marks and it retains the Argentine crest on the receiver which is quite uncommon, more common on carbines than on the rifles. The stock has been refinished at some point but was done well. Also this rifle is what some call a ""parade rifle"" and is priced accordingly. I have no provenance to prove that these guns that are called such were ever actually used as parade rifles and it very well could've been done by an importer or reseller. What this means is that the bolt, bolt stop, butt plate, barrel bands, magazine, and cleaning rod have had the bluing polished off and are in the ""white."" It does look quite good this way and while the barrel and receiver are the only parts retaining blue the bluing is quite good and there is no pitting anywhere above or below the stock line. Bore is good, not perfect but good and it shoots as well as you can expect a 123 year old rifle to shoot. I have 60 rounds of PPU ammo and 76 pieces of assorted brass (60 pieces PPU and 16 pieces I formed from Remington 8mm Mauser brass) along with a set of Lee dies I will include.
