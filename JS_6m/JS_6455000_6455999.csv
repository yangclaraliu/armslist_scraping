I recently finished this build and I really love it, however, a situation has come up and I need to sell it. The short story is that I have invested in Saker Suppressor mounts intending to eventually purchase the suppressor. I have them pinned and welded on multiple rifles so I do not want to go through the hassle of removing them. My local shop is blowing out their Sakers due to them being discontinued. Due to the fact that they are being discontinued and considering that I can get a 7.62 saker for $599, I have to let this rifle go.It is built of an SMOS GFY builder set with 13.6"" MLok rail. If you are not aware, SMOS (Stubborn Mule Outdoor Supply) was the machine shop that produced Noveske receivers and rails up until recently.  The SMOS GFY billet receiver set is essentially identical to a Noveske Gen 3 set minus a provision for a forward assist.  It is barreled with a SS 14.5"" Noveske Afghan with a YHM phantom flash hider that I have perm attached by silver solder done by Axlnt (KM3 solutions). He also did the assembly of the rifle. It also has a BCM CH, Toolcraft BCG with melonite coating from Cryptic Coatings. Lower has a Ruger 2 stage trigger, Strike industries takedown pins, and Odin Works Mag release. Magpul SL grip and fixed carbine stock (Gray). QD endplate. Magpul AFG Mlok and mlok covers also included. Magpul MBUS are also included.The only thing this rifle needs is an optic. The EOTech is not included.It has not been fired except for test fire.I currently have this on consignment at my local gun store so you can buy with a card and have it directly shipped to your FFL. If you have any questions let me know and I will answer them.It is currently listed at Lanco Tactical in Elizabethtown, PA. REDACTEDIt is the bottom rifle in the pictures."

This is an older model which is desireable. It has a Swift 3x9 scope that is on sale right now for $199 but normal price is $214 on Optics planet. The Rings cost $40 and the base was $15. The Sling is another $20. This is a good deal for a gun that is in great shape.  Looking at the rifle it looks like it may not have ever been fired. It is in very nice shape and the crown looks new. Don't let a little dust and the light confuse you, there are no marks on this rifle, neither the wood or the metal."

The extremely lightweight design (21 oz.) coupled with a proprietary cartridge gave it a soft welcome from professionals and civillians alike. Today, the Five Seven has earned a reputation for being the most ferocious tactical handgun available. The 5.7x28mm round has little to no recoil despite the gun's weight and ballistically it shreds through body armor with ease unlike virtually every other automatic handgun cartridge. Several law enforcement agencies and special military organizations have adopted the Five Seven as their go-to sidearm due to its sterling performance as an anti-personnel weapon.  In a nutshell, the Five Seven is tough as nails, light as a feather, and extreme deadly in tactical situations!"

(Scope, Rings, and Bipod not included)This rifle is a compilation of some of the best components available for the LR-308 platform and was built to perform as a top of the line semi-auto precision sniper rifle. I have fired it in side by side comparisons with several other high end LR-308 platforms and it holds its own if not out performing. It shoots consistant .5-.75MOA with match 175SMK's and is still holding sub moa vertical dispersion at 800 meters. I have not shot it for accuracy past 800 but it achieves consistant hits on steel well beyond that. The rifle uses the JP PSC upper which has a dual charging handle. You can use the left side charging handle while maintaining your firing position, eliminating the need to take your eye off target. The round count on the rifle is about 550 (all match 175SMK), no reloads.Component list: 
Upper Receiver: JP PSC-12 dual charging handle (left side and top) upper receiver with low mass bolt carrier group.Barrel: 18"" 5R 1:9.5"" twist Bartlein barrel contoured and chambered by Compass Lake Engineering to their M110 contour with a JP compensator and SLR adjustable gas block.Hand Guard: JP Modular Handguard with a bipod stud, full-length top rail, QD flush mount cup, and one 2"" accessory rail.Upper rail riser accessory: PRI 30MOA biased rail.Lower Receiver: Patriot Ordnance P-308 (same as GA Precision GAP-10 rifle).Trigger: JP single stage EZ Trigger.Misc lower parts: JP Silent Captured Spring, Magpul CTR stock, POF LPK.The entire rifle is Cerakoted for added protection. The rifle is mostly built off of JP parts as you can see. The equivelant rifle (per JP rifle builder) would be 4084.95 new. I have roughly 3400.00 in parts plus labor costs for barrel work into the gun. I know I'm not going to get what I have into it but won't entertain lowball offers. If your looking for a good deal a top of the line LR308, Make an offer, if its a fair offer I'll get back to you.Let me know if you have any questions."

I'm only looking for cash now...For your consideration, a very nice, almost mint, Polytech Bakelite side Folder AK chambered in 7.62x39. I bought this privately a couple years ago, shot it once and it has been in my safe ever since. I ended up buying an Arsenal AK which became my shooter and only took this one to wipe down with oil.This includes three Chinese ""Poly"" marked 30 round magazines and one Russian Bakelite magazine (not in photo), the original Chinese AK sling, cleaning kit in the trapdoor of the folding stock and original Polytech instruction manual (also not in photo). This is a beautiful AK that is somewhat rare in the US. It is 100% pre-ban Chinese/Polytech and not a kit or 922r, etc. The bluing and Bakelite furniture are mint and the bore is shiney and sharp. The gas piston has very minimal carbon on it. The action is buttery smooth...puts an Arsenal to shame. I have a bunch of photographs I can send on request.I do not tolerate scammers/criminals and I can pick them out a mile away (I do it for a living) so don't even try me.Terms of sale: I will only sell to a NH resident with a valid NH drivers license who has a valid NH conceal carry permit.

The Kadet conversion will not work on the 97, 75 TS, 2075 RAMI, SP-01 Phantom, P-07 or P-09 models. Pre-B model 75s may or may not function with the Kadet due to differing magwell dimensions. When used on an aluminum-framed compact model (PCR, P-01 and P-06) as well as the steel-framed Compact .40, a specific slide-stop is required for proper last-round hold-open (part number REDACTED, available at no charge through our parts department).

It has a hex reciever. These prewar Nagants are considered better because they are finished better because during the war they were churning these out without much care for the fit and finish.This rifle is a good shooter and in original shape with no rust. It is missing the cleaning rod but those can be had cheaply online. The stock has some dents and coud be refinished but I wanted to keep it unmodified. Ovrall its in pretty good shape for a 90 year old rifle that has been through World War II.These Nagant rifles are great for hunting or prepping, the ammo is cheap and powerful and they are very heavy duty built rifles compared to what you can get new nowadays.The first $220 takes this rifle."

PRODUCT SUMMARY
If you're looking for a definition of SIG Sauer's well-known unfailing reliability, look at the P220. In 1976, the .45 ACP P220 was introduced and quickly became recognized as one of the most accurate 45s right out of the box. Since that time the P220 has earned an enviable record in hot spots around the world. The P220R features a stainless steel slide machined from barstock and coated with a durable, wear resistant Nitron finish, a lightweight alloy frame with M1913 Picatinny rail, and the Sig Sauer four-point safety system of decocking lever, patented automatic firing pin safety block, safety intercept notch, and trigger bar disconnector. Holds 8 rounds of .45 ACP ammunition and features a matte black finish and SIGLite night sights.

I purchesed the gun about 18 months ago, took it to the range once to sight it in, maybe shot 10 rounds throught it. It has pretty much been a safe queen since that time. It is topped with a Vortex 2-7 Scout Scope. The gun has both a peep rear sight and blade front sight. If you don't like the scout set up you could also mount a scope in the traditional manner. It is very accurate with factory loads. The gun is in pristine condition. These rifles in this caliber are very hard to find, you can look for yourself, that is why the price I am asking is fair.

While there are NO blemishes in the matte blued steel, if inspected carefully, the satin finish walnut stock does show a slight bit of wear from gentle use.
