Shoots under 1"" at 100y with the Federal Power Shok 150 gr SP. The ""Classic"" Model 70s were released in the early 1990s, the last of the M70s based on pre-'64 specs ever produced in the New Haven plant. Like the pre-'64s, the Classics feature CRF (control round feed), fixed ejector, and claw extractor. It's just a great rifle, with a fantastic trigger (currently breaks crisply at about 2lbs), in exceptional condition. I don't want to sell it. But circumstances dictate. I have about one box of ammo for it, some Federal SPs and a few Winchester 150 gr Ballistic Silvertips. Twenty bullets in all, I think.The price is for rifle only, although most pics show a scope mounted. I can provide any number of other pics upon request. And I have pics of targets I've shot with the rifle that show the accuracy. I was able to shrink groups from 2"" at 100y to under 1"" with two small adjustments of the BOSS. The muzzle brake feature of the BOSS yields recoil somewhere in the 30-30 range. I haven't measured it, but that's just my impression shooting it. It's really comfortable to shoot."

Aero Precision Gen 2 Lower Receiver Aero Precision’s roots are deeply tied to aerospace, and their drive for clean, perfect engineering and machining stems from that.

Machined to mil-spec dimensions, these lowers ensure the highest quality with a correct component interface. 8.35 oz. Made in the USA Machined from 7075-T6 forged aluminum   Upper Tension Screw - Allows users to fine tune the fit of the upper and lower receiver through the use of a nylon tipped tensioning set screw inserted in the grip tang of the lower receiver. This provides a tight fit with any standard AR15 upper receiver. Increased Magwell Flare - Allows for easier insertion of magazines and provides a sleeker look.

Matte black finish Fits: Picatinny/Weaver rails   One Magpul PMAG Gen 3 Magazine Included   Rogers Super Stock The Rogers Super-Stoc™ (commonly called the Super Stock) is the ultimate refinement in AR/M4 stock technology. The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is the most stable, collapsible stock available due to the innovative cam-lock system developed by Bill Rogers, famed shooting instructor, inventor of holsters, target systems, and other related products, and his staff of engineers. The cam-lock system completely removes any slop or play inherent with collapsible stocks. Once the desired stock position has been selected, the stock can be locked down solid simply by clicking the cam-lock lever upward. Pressing the quick-release lever will disengage both the cam-lock, and the detent pin, allowing you to quickly readjust the stock position. The innovative Rogers Super-Stoc™ also removes the guesswork involved with buffer tube sizes. The stock will fit both a Mil-Spec sized buffer tube as well as a Commercial sized buffer tube with a few simple adjustments. Weighing in at only 7.3 oz, it is among the lightest stocks available, but rugged enough to pass a 36"", fully loaded drop test. MADE IN THE USA"

732,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6709732,For Sale:  Glock 17 Gen 3,"Lakeville, Minneapolis / St. Paul, Minnesota",$ 499,"Listed On: Friday, May 11, 2018",Handguns,Glock                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Pistol,"Glock Perfection. The Glock 17 Gen3 is ideal for home defense, concealed carry or as a duty weapon. It is a full size, 9mm, polymer frame handgun that uses a locked breach system referred to as ""Safe Action"". This is the combination of a trigger safety, firing pin safety and drop safety that render the loaded pistol incapable of firing, even when banged or bumped, unless someone actually squeezes the trigger. Because it does not have a hammer, the spring loaded striker (firing pin) is technically blocked off, partially retracted and not in geometric alignment with a chambered cartridge. It is only by squeezing the trigger, which fully retracts and then releases the striker, that makes the pistol then capable of firing. The absence of a hammer also provides a sleeker profile that reduces both size and weight, while optimizing a smoother draw from concealment. The Glock 17 Gen3 has the advantage of not having a manual safety, thus eliminating the need to consciously think about deactivating such a device during a deadly encounter. This is the ultimate point and shoot pistol. With 50% fewer components than conventional handguns of the same caliber, it means there are fewer parts to break, and you can literally disassemble and then reassemble the gun within seconds. The frame is made out of a synthetic polymer that is actually stronger than steel, yet 86% lighter and virtually indestructible. It can withstand temperatures ranging from -40 F to +158 F and still continue firing. An integral accessory rail provides the added benefit of quickly attaching lasers and / or lights for low visibility applications. The ergonomic grip angle is designed to allow the shooter to rapidly deploy the pistol under stress fire conditions. This pistol series is referred to as ""Gen3"" and has an advantage over its Gen4 counterpart. Without a rough texture finish, the standard Gen3 Glock has a grip surface that is virtually non- abrasive. When carrying concealed, this translates to less grating on the skin of your back, hip or stomach. It is also far less likely to cling to clothing, especially lighter materials, leading to an easier and more consistent draw from concealment. Textured finger grooves still provide a solid grip, while square-shaped, raised dimples on the sides of the frame, frontstrap and backstrap provide even more security and excellent control while shooting.The Glock 17 Gen3 features an outstanding ergonomic design, where a highly efficient bore axis-to-weight distribution ratio ensures controlled shots, even under rapid fire conditions. In addition, the polymer frame also provides much softer felt recoil than most conventional metal frame handguns. The pistol weighs in at a little over 22- ounces and has a DAO trigger pull of roughly 5.5 pounds. The metal components have been finished with a unique surface treatment called Tenifer that is extremely corrosion and wear resistant. In case you are unfamiliar with Tenifer, it's Glock's trade name for the ferric nitrocarburized case hardening process that diffuses nitrogen and carbon directly into the surface metal, thereby elevating the Rockwell hardness to somewhere between a file and a diamond. Two full capacity 17- round magazines are provided with Glock 17 Gen3 pistols. A set of white outline sights sit on top of the slide, are highly visible, easy to use and track reasonably well. The 4.49"" hexagonal hammer forged barrel of the Glock 17 Gen3 increase muzzle velocity and provide greater accuracy than conventional rifled barrels.Features Caliber: 9mm Magazines: (2) 17- Round Barrel: 4.49"" Hexagonal Rifling Sights: Fixed White Outline Weight: 22ozs. Trigger Pull: 5.5lbs Integral Tactical Rail 3rd Generation models are distinguished from 1st & 2nd gen Glocks by the addition of a tactical rail, thumb rests on either side of the frame, finger grooves on the strap & a loaded chamber indicator on the extractor. Unlike Gen4 models, Gen3 Glocks feature a standard (vs. rough) texture frame. Warranty: ""Based on the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, GLOCK Inc. offers no express warranty on its product line.

Also good for bedside protection, compact and light.  Double action trigger makes it far less likely to fire accidentlly.  Uses forward tilting barrel rather than spring loaded slide for loading, much easier for girl (or someone with a medical condition, like my wife) to load.  Inexpensive to practice with, 22lr ammo is available for around 5-7 cents per round (compared with about 30-35 cents per round for .380 or 9mm)LIKE NEW CONDITION.  Have original box and paperwork.  Could likely pass off as 'new', but I wouldn't do that, wouldn't be honest :)   Fired one day at range to get used to it (approx 50 rounds thru it, then cleaned). Bought it for my wife to carry, but she preferred my Sig P238, so I had to spend about $700 and buy a second one for her.  Loads of fun.Private sale.  If you are in Louisiana (and appear to be legit) there is no FFL required and no government documentation.  No sales tax or FFL fees.  $245 out the door and it's yours without the gov't having a record.  Can be picked up in Baton Rouge.  Have had too many out of state people send fake 'cashiers checks' for it (wanting me to send them money in return or send a deposit slip so they can get my bank account info - not dumb enough to fall for either of those scams.)  Local pickup only.    Thanks."
