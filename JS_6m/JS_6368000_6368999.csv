I took this in trade a bit ago, and have not carried it once. It does have a apex trigger with forward set sear kit as well and a Blackhawk holster, with all the factory back straps that came with it, and one that has been stippled as well. The trigger guard has been undercut and is really well done. I'm looking to trade for something else, either hand gun, or bolt action, ammo, or something.  I love glocks, sigs especially 320's, revolvers, 1911's, 9mm, .40, open to anything really.

Selling as 2wd. 4x4 doesn't engage when you turn the switch but it has no adverse effects on the truck's drivability. Planning to fix the 4x4 and upping the price when i get time, if i still have it. I just figured I would list it minus the work in the mean time and see whats out there. You'd be hard pressed to find a better running /driving truck for the price as is though. The instrument panel and odometer had to be replaced but work perfectly now, the title reflects that the odometer has been replaced.

These gen 2.5s are pretty hard to find.This model was manufactured when Glock was in the process of changing over factory tooling from the gen 2 style frames to the gen 3 style.That's where the name gen 2.5 comes from, the front of the frame is smooth and not railed like the gen 3, all of its other features are identical to that of the gen 3 frame.This thing has a ton of slide greying and character wear on the slide from being carried, it was treated as a tool and not as a safe queen.Allthough it has been broken in well, Glock lovers will know that it's life of service is just getting started. The internals look great and it has strong bright bore.I personally like the look of glocks without rails, it makes for ultra smooth holstering and feels comfortable too.So we have a full size .45 acp Glock 21 gen 3 w/o rail.It will come with a Crown Kydex concealment holster and mag carrier.Meprolight Orange and Green Tru Dot night sights with plenty of life in them.1 modern 13 round Glock mag and 1 10 round mag that was mad during the 10 round limit magazine ban.Got plenty of .45acp too for the right trade."
