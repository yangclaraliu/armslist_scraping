I still have box and pamphlets/lock, and the gun has only been out three times. I also have a Tasco Pronghorn(3-9x32) scope mounted on it, but plan to keep unless the price is right.(You could save money sighting a new one in by buying this all set up) It is sighted in at 75 yards with factory ammo (1240-1260fps), anything faster, such as CCI stingers(1640 fps) will be shooting a bit high and right.

READ FIRST! I have here a Springfield Armory TRP Operator with everything that came with it from the factory. This pistol is used; it has had 500 rounds through it and has the typical wear and handling marks you'd expect from a gun that's been fired. This is a TRP Operator, not  the cheaper Loaded Operator. Shoot Self sells these for $1550 (just checked today) and the typical price online is $1400 new. You don't have the cash to buy it, I get it, so let's trade. I would like to trade for a high quality, military pattern, semi-automatic rifle with detachable magazines. I have been shooting and collecting 20 years, so I do not need any AR15s or AKs, period. I don't care how nice it is or how much Tapco stuff is on it. I don't need ARs or AKs. I don't need any handguns whatsoever. I don't care about your Glock that you removed all the protective finish from the slide and barrel, stippled the frame, plopped in a bunch of aftermarket parts, and now consider it ""custom."" I don't need it."

Great looking and shooting gun only has a couple tiny scratches by the rear sight on top, they are small and look like a mag might have bumped it in the box but you hardly notice them, I just wanted to mention it. Im looking to trade becuase overall I'm just not a fan of the way glock changed the stippling and grip on the new Gen 4's. Im open to trades on other nice handguns H&Ks, Sigs,Brownings, Beretta, maybe a kimber, Im really open to a lot of different handguns as long as the value is around equal. Not looking for any rifle except maybe a Ruger Mini 14 or 30, or maybe an AR depeding upon caliber. No shotguns unless its an nice 12ga over under that is heavily in my favor value wise. Shoot me an email with a pic and we can go from there. All Laws Apply. In order to buy or trade you must exchange a copy of your Nc CCW and Lic and sign a bill of sale like wise all give you a copy of my ccw and lic. Im in Rocky Mount/Tarboro and not looking to travel to far, at most 30 miles.

Size matters in a concealed carry pistol. Reduced dimensions and light weight are as important as magazine capacity and power. Kimber Ultra Carry pistols in .45 ACP and 9 mm have it all, and put it together in a 1911 package that simply outperforms any other type of semi-automatic. To ensure dependability, Ultra Carry lightweight aluminum frames are machined on the same computer-driven machines and to the same unequaled tolerances as Kimber steel frames. Each model has standard Kimber features like rounded and blended edges, beveled magazine well, extended thumb safety and bumped beavertail grip safety. Magazine capacity is 7 rounds in .45 ACP. They fit almost any size hand and point naturally. Best of all, the crisp, clean single action trigger eliminates long travel, heavy pull and the guessing that goes with it. For concealed carry, nothing beats a 1911–and no 1911 beats a Kimber.Caliber: .45 ACP Height (inches) 90 degrees to barrel: 4.75Weight (ounces) with empty magazine: 25Length (inches): 6.8Magazine capacity: 8Ambidextrous thumb safetyRecoil spring (pounds): 16Full-length guide rodAlso available: 9 mmFrameMaterial: AluminumFinish: Satin silverWidth (inches): 1.15Front strap serrationsHigh polished small partsFront strap checkering: ball-milled groovesGrooved aluminum mainspring housingRound heelSlideMaterial: Stainless steelFinish: High polishedCut scroll engraving and borderBarrelLength: 3-inchMaterial: Stainless steelTwist rate (left hand): 16RampedSightsType: Tactical Wedge night sights, fixedRadius: 4.8 inchesGripsAluminum ball-milled thin gripsTriggerSolid high polished, match gradeFactory setting (approximate pounds): 4.0–5.0"

XD-S 45 ACP 
Essential Package 
3.3"" 6+1,5+1
 
The XD-S Single Stack  from Springfield Armory has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD and XD(M) lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.
The XD-S is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.
The strengths of the XD-S 3.3? Single Stack don’t stop there. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD pistols safe and easy to use.
Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S 3.3? Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable
