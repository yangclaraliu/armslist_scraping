The LWRC M6 IC SPR FDE features the lwrc fully ambidextrous lower receiver. The LWRC M6 IC SPR FDE has controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, The new dual control lower receiver of the LWRC M6 IC SPR FDE is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

Moreover, the mounting base of the LWRC M6 IC SPR FDE handguard is machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight.

I have a pre-64 for comparison..There are a few updated features, such as rebounding hammer, tang mounted safety, coil hammer spring, and drilled and tapped for scopeThe bore is mirror-perfect, the wood finish is high gloss and the bluing is excellent. The rifle has very few rounds through it.

The LWRC M6 IC SPR includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years. The LWRC M6 IC SPR features the lwrc fully ambidextrous lower receiver. The LWRC M6 IC SPR has controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, The new dual control lower receiver of the LWRC M6 IC SPR is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers. The Monoforge™ upper receiver of LWRC M6 IC SPR is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced by LWRCI™ in 2011. The LWRC M6 IC SPR features a user-configurable rail system. Moreover, the mounting base of the LWRC M6 IC SPR handguard is machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight. The new LWRC M6 IC SPR Individual Carbine from LWRCI shows that, at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward.

THIS PISTOL IS GLOCK FACTORY BRUSHED STAINLESS SLIDE AND OD GREEN FRAME. The G43 is our new single stack 9mm pistol. The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCK history. Designed to be the favored back up or last resort option for both civilian and law enforcement use, this subcompact slimline design is the perfectly balanced answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It is ultra-concealable, accurate and comfortable for all shooters regardless of hand size. Fit & Feel When it comes to size and comfort, the all new G43 provides the best of both worlds. Typically, with handguns of this dimension, the design of the pistol does a poor job of resolving issues concerning felt recoil. This can cause discomfort for shooters who are not familiar with shooting smaller framed pistols. Seasoned shooters are familiar with this and adjust their grip, but have to work harder to keep the pistol on target for follow-up shots. The design of the new G43 allow for a more comfortable and confident shooting experience for all types of users. Caliber 9x19 has become a standard in personal defense nationwide and for militaries throughout the world. The G43 is designed for any 9x19 round the civilian or law enforcement communities see fit to use. From the 64 grain to the 147 grain bullet, the all new G43 will function within the full spectrum of available ammunition.

The G43 is our new single stack 9mm pistol. The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCK history. Designed to be the favored back up or last resort option for both civilian and law enforcement use, this subcompact slimline design is the perfectly balanced answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It is ultra-concealable, accurate and comfortable for all shooters regardless of hand size. Fit & Feel When it comes to size and comfort, the all new G43 provides the best of both worlds. Typically, with handguns of this dimension, the design of the pistol does a poor job of resolving issues concerning felt recoil. This can cause discomfort for shooters who are not familiar with shooting smaller framed pistols. Seasoned shooters are familiar with this and adjust their grip, but have to work harder to keep the pistol on target for follow-up shots. The design of the new G43 allow for a more comfortable and confident shooting experience for all types of users. Caliber 9x19 has become a standard in personal defense nationwide and for militaries throughout the world. The G43 is designed for any 9x19 round the civilian or law enforcement communities see fit to use. From the 64 grain to the 147 grain bullet, the all new G43 will function within the full spectrum of available ammunition.

I'm not an experienced shooter.Less than 50 rounds fired.**The buttstock bag, buttstock cushion, scope, sling, bi-pod, rifle bag, lock are NOT included** I didn't take them off for the photo because it is too much effort in case I can find another way to bring them with me.Contact me if you are interested and maybe we can discuss price but this rifle brand new is $749 at Cabellas, Gander Mtn. etc. and this rifle is barely used.The scope was $300, I'm probably going to use if for my next rifle unless buyer wants to purchase it also.  The reason I'm selling it is because of complications with moving to Canada. I don't actually want to sell it. There is nothing wrong with it."

""Abe Lincoln may have freed all men, but Sam Colt made them equal”
This post-Civil War slogan would have been music to Sam Colt’s ears had he lived long enough to hear it. Yet, even before his death at age 47, he knew that his invention of a weapon capable of firing without reloading would be a tremendous success throughout the world & would alter the course of history. As a result of his invention & marketing successes, Colt has played a prominent role in the development of America, and has become the most well-known name in firearms throughout much of the world.
The advantage of the LE6940 is unmatched. The LE6940 displays fresh ingenuity with a Magpul MBUS backup sight and a folding front sight for enhanced optical solutions and four rails positions for mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This feature affords unmatched repeatability for mounting optical systems, not found traditional handguard rail systems. Designed with accuracy in mind, its true free-floating 16.1” chrome lined barrel provides the enhanced accuracy necessary for long-range shooting.Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.Buy this rifle online at www.copsgunshop.net."
