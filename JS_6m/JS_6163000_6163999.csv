It's a full JP build upper. 18"" cryo treated match barrel with matching bolt. Full LMOS system. I had Randall (AR15Barrels) thin the barrel profile to shave off over 1/2lb of weight. I put and SLR adjustable gas block on there and an SJC Titan comp. Lower is a Mega Gator with a Timney trigger, BCM/Vltor charging handle, and an Ace skeleton stock. This gun shoots rediculously flat and soft.This is my match gun but I haven't shot it much since having a kid a few years ago. I put bout 1k rounds through this thing. It's about 300rnds each match and it's been to only 2 and a couple ASR trips. This is a featureless build. It's gtg with a normal mag release. I'll include a couple new Hexmags and other stuff in the deal too. Rifle only (no optic)"

I've tried downloading it to 5 or 3 rounds, I've even tried firing a few and then topping off the mag and still, every time it seems that the last round, and the last round only, stovepipes. I have to assume that there's some sort of defect in the design where the next round in the mag helps the previous one eject. But let's be honest here, this is a .25 ACP Pocket pistol.

It is a piston driven AR, which yields a lot of great benefits, in that it cycles faster, runs cleaner and more reliably, and is easier to take down and clean. If you have questions about the Piston vs. the standard Direct Impingement system, I encourage you to look it up. The Truth About Guns did a review on this gun, and it can be found at this link:http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2014/03/foghorn/gun-review-adams-arms-tactical-evo-rifle/The current version of this rifle can be found online at the adams arms website, though it is severely backordered:http://www.adamsarms.net/16-mid-tactical-evo-rifleThe lower is a Spartan Tactical ""MOLON LABE"" lower which has been colorized in Red and White. This stripped lower can be found at:http://www.joeboboutfitters.com/Spartan_15_Enhanced_Billet_Lower_Receiver_p/jb-spartan15.htmI am willing to include a lot of the accessories which I have for this rifle. Too many to list, but if you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask me. (NOTE: There are a few things that are in the pic that I no longer have)There is a 3-9x40mm scope mounted on the gun in the pics, with parallax adjustment and illuminated reticle. It can put 5-shot groups in 2 MOA at 100 yds all day (with several sub-MOA groups mixed in)--and I haven't sandbagged it or put it in a vise or anything, that's just shooting from the grip pod (and I'm a crappy shot!). I also have a 4-reticle reflex sight with an optionally attached laser and a pressure pad. (The scope is not on the gun right now, but I can include it if desired.  Currently has the reflex sight)I have a grip-pod on this gun, as seen in the attached photos(those things aren't cheap...).  5 magazines--2x Magpul Gen3 window mags(awesome), 1x tapco AR15 Mag, and 2x steel mags. All work perfect.I currently have 922 rounds of brass cased 5.56 ammo (including 100 rounds of hollow point) to include with the deal. I can also include only 422 or 322 rounds if you would like, or zero.This gun has been meticulously taken care of and cleaned after every trip to the range. If you are a serious buyer, I would be happy to show you how to take it all the way down with the piston system--it's not difficult. I firmly believe that this is one of the nicest AR-15s I have ever shot, and it continually impresses me. I can honestly say that I have never had a misfire with it. I am just at a point in my life where this gun doesn't make a ton of sense for me to own. It's a great firearm and I would love to see it go to somebody who will use it and enjoy it.As always, cash talks, but I would also be interested in a trade for other firearms, or really anything of interest. I would consider any rifles, pistols, or shotguns, bows, hunting/target/defense, anything. If you only want some of this stuff, you can make an offer on just part of it.  We can also work out a trade plus cash, whatever it takes. Worst I can say is no, so make an offer!Thanks for looking."

More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip. An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. Front cocking serrations provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm, or conducting press checks. The pistol is available in 9 mm and also features low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc., P-SAIT trigger. In addition, a solid steel guide rod adds weight where it matters most."
