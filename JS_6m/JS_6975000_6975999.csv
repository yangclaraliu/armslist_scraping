Carry with ease, draw with confidence, fire with precision. The Sphinx SDP SubCompact Alpha is the smallest and lightest of the SDP line up of pistols. The SubCompact Alpha is the pefect choice for concealed carry, or professional duty use, with an overall weight just under 25oz and an overall height and width at 4.9"" and 1.2"" respectively. Though the SDP Subcompact Alpha is small in stature it does not sacrifice in quality or peformance. Through precision machining and hand fitting by a master gunsmith, the SDP SubCompact Alpha can achieve similar groupings to that of its larger counterpart, the Compact Alpha. The SubCompact Alpha shares more than just high performance figures with the larger pistols in the Alpha Line. It also features a steel slide machined from billet. The upper frame, machined from billet aluminum, features full length internal guide rails which provide very smooth slide operation as well as solid barrel lock up. The pistol grip is polymer and textured for maximum ergonomics and grip. The pistol grip is also contoured to offer high hand placement to complinent the low bore axis, which assist the shooter with managing recoil. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the SubCompact Alpha. The white dot front sight is easy to see in contrast to the black rear sight. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth, in both double and single action mode, with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. Every component of the SDP SubCompact Alpha is the only choice for discerning shooters that demand the utmost in build quality and performance.

This holster has been very lightly used. It carries very easily, uses kydex on leather wings for comfort. it also is adjustable. I no longer have my Glock 19 so that is the only reason I am selling it. I am only asking $55, they sell for $80 new. Thanks!Website description: 
The Mini WING™ retains the popular KYDEX® and leather combination of the Leather WING™, however this holster is built as a dedicated IWB holster. Designed to be minimalistic, the Mini WING™ uses as little material as possible, without sacrificing performance or durability. Dedicated to maintaining a thin profile, the Mini WING™ allows for deep concealment matched with ultimate comfort.
The pairing of KYDEX® and leather on this holster allows for the KYDEX® to reliably retain your pistol without a break in or wear out period. In addition, the KYDEX® shell prevents the holster from collapsing when your pistol is drawn, and remains open for easy one handed holstering. The leather “mini wings” are incorporated to allow the holster to wrap around the contours of your waist, allowing for a versatile fit for all body types. The “mini wings” give the holster flexibility to move with your body, making it comfortable for use all day, every day. The “mini wings” were constructed to provide the user with a variety of different configurations for IWB carry as well as a wind range of cant and ride height adjustments. This provides the user with a variety of available carry positions around the waist, from appendix, all the way to the small of the back.If interested please email me through the listing. Thanks!"

A piston contained in the cylinder located beneath the barrel opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel, allowing the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.The SOFCOIL Technology:  Allows the slide to be easily manipulated to chamber a round Barrel rise is reduced up to one third lease than similar pistols Decreased barrel rise helps you to remain focused to accurately hit your target shot after shot.

To me, it had only two shortcomings; one was that it had no ambidextrous safety, and the other was that it was a heavy little chunk of a pistol. Now, ATI has corrected those two items, as the new Lightweight Fatboy has an ambidextrous safety, and as the “Lightweight” name implies, the Fatboy has lost some weight. The new LW Fatboy weighs almost nine ounces less than the original steel-framed Fatboy, which makes a lot of difference on a gun that is built for concealed carry. Like the original, the Fatboy is chambered for the 45 ACP cartridge, and packing either eleven or thirteen shots fully-loaded, depending upon the magazine that is shipped with the pistol, the Fatboy is an excellent fighting handgun. Depending upon your state and local ordinances, you can buy the Fatboy with either a ten-shot or a twelve-shot magazine. I also tried a Para fourteen-shot magazine, and it worked well. Like other pistols that are based upon the 1911 design, the Fatboy is intended to be carried with a round in the chamber, and the safety on. The Fatboy also incorporates an automatic grip safety. Thankfully, there is no magazine safety. The hammer is of the Rowell type, commonly referred to as a Commander-style hammer. The grip safety is an excellent upswept beavertail unit. The black checkered plastic grips are thin, and feel great to my hand; much better than the original grip of the steel Fatboy. The LW Fatboy uses an aluminum frame to reduce weight, but the slide, barrel, and small parts are a matte-black finished steel, with the area of barrel over the chamber polished to a natural finish. Like the original Fatboy, the barrel and slide use no barrel bushing. The guide rod is a captured multiple-spring design. The trigger is steel, as is the mainspring housing. The only plastic parts on this weapon are the grip panels, the magazine base plate, and the magazine follower. The sights are very rugged, and easy to see. Both front and back are dovetailed into the slide, and are adjustable for windage correction. The front sight has an inset white bead. New these are $449 if you can find them and OEM mags are readily available, simply do some research I found them at cheaper than dirt for $35. Thanks for looking!"
