The P238 HD features a stainless steel frame and slide that gives the pistol just enough added weight over polymer-frame pistol designs to enhance controllability during rapid fire considerably, while minimizing felt recoil. Sig P238 pistols are modeled on a 1911-style, single action design, with a thumb safety. The hammer recesses into the beavertail section of the frame to protect it when carrying the weapon on safe, and to avoid hammer-bite while firing. The pistol operates with a locked-breech, short recoil action (instead of blowback) which locks the action closed, resulting in a slide that is easier to rack due to a reduced recoil spring weight. Slide serrations also enhance the shooter's ability to pull the slide back for loading and clearing the action. G-10 grip panels provide a solid hold and enhance durability. The Sig Sauer P238 HD Semi-Auto Pistol comes with SIGLITE® night sights for rapid sight acquisition in any light, including total darkness. The compact P238 can be carried comfortably all-day—everyday, keeping it within reach for situations that call for rapid deployment of well-placed shots."

However, with a little practice, some slight aiming in the general direction of your target, and something other than slapping the trigger...BOOM, there goes the center of your target, like it was laser guided and preordained!  Get yourself a case or two of this and youll be challenging ole jerry miculek himself in no time flat.  Also, its loaded on the light side, so if you have limp wrists, this may be the ammo of your dreams. Youll be able to shoot all day and not cry about it.  Asking $250 per case, unless you have a better idea.Also, if you have a super cheap gun, with terrible craftsmanship, you may have feeding issues.  But any gun worth its weight, with a feed ramp/ ok barrel will eat this like a boss."
