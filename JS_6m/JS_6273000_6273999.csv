These KS-47s are an AR platform that is chambered in 7.62x39, and accepts any AK magazine. Way cheaper to shoot than firing 5.56 or 223, plus much more punch! If you're unfamiliar with these rifles, check out the video on youtube (PSA KS47 -vs- CMMG Mutant).The PSA KS47 is based on the AR15, and combines the modular construction, accuracy and precision of the AR platform with the stopping power and the magazine options of the AK. While the current AR47 fires the 7.62x39 AK round, it uses modified AR-style magazines that are not nearly as plentiful as AK-style magazines, that were optimized for reliable feeding of the 7.62x39 round. The KS47 lets the AK shooter capitalize on his inventory of magazines and ammo with an AR-style platform. Unlike the AK, where the barrel is permanently pressed into the receiver, the KS47 features an AR-style modular configuration which consists of a barreled upper receiver, and a lower receiver that houses the fire control group and magazine. I'm asking $900 for the rifle with one steel or PMAG 30 round magazine (buyers choice). Would trade for a Sig Sauer P226 MK25.Can add additional items for the right trade.*** Drum magazine in pics is not include with this sell, at this price, but can be added."

This allowed the shooter to keep the long sight radius of a rifle for accuracy, but keep the carbine length barrel for maneuverability. The proximity of the gas port to the muzzle, however, played havoc with timing and made reliability a hit or miss proposition. Advances in AR technology have produced reliable carbine and mid-length gas systems, that can be hidden using low-profile gas blocks. This allows for a front sight base to be pinned in the rifle position for the longer sight radius without the worry of the unorthodox gas port location affecting operation. Barrel: 416 Stainless steel. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a mid-length gas system.

The 92 has been the standard issued pistol of the US military since 1984, so needless to say it is dependable. It has an open slide design, so the barrel shows through. It has an external hammer that can be cocked back to change the trigger pull from a double-action (long pull) to a single-action (short pull). An ambidextrous safety also acts as a de-cocking lever and when pushed down it rotates the firing pin out of alignment. A second safety feature is its visible automatic firing pin block, which prevents the pistol from discharging if accidentally dropped. And, it has thee-dot fixed sights. Beretta recommends the 92 for military, law enforcement and personal defense."

This is an 8.5 inch pistol and has a stainless steel barrel that looks really sharp with the all black gun. It has a pistol length gas system which is vital to run both super sonic and sub sonic ammo reliably. The twist rate of the barrel is 1 in 7 which is the most effective for middle of the road weight bullets. It will shoot any 300 blackout ammo however. It has a 7 inch lightweight keymod handguard which gives it a nice profile to hold, it isnt as bulkey as most rails. This is a very lightweight ""Pistol"" and will be a lot of fun for the new owner. The gun is pretty much new, I just finished getting it together and decided that I wanted to go with an 18inch rifle instead. I am asking $700 and that will include 60 rounds of 300 blackout as well as the red dot sight! I am open to offers, I would also be willing to trade, but I need at least $400 cash no matter what the trade is.

The BPY prefix indicates a batch of firearms that were meant for the Brazilian market but not all of them made it to Brazil. The prefix also dates this revolver to the early to mid 90s. This revolver has only ever been fired 20 times. The wear on the cylinder shows it's very limited usage. It functions flawlessly, as expected.  I am am including the the wood grips that are on it and pair of S&W ivory grips that look fantastic.

This is an 8.5 inch pistol and has a nitride barrel that is chromolly lined. This ""pistol"" looks really sharp in all black, is super compact, and very lightweight. You will not believe how good this thing feels. It has a pistol length gas system which allows you to shoot basically any ammo and still cycle reliably. The twist rate of the barrel is 1 in 7 which will be best with heavier rounds, but it can shoot any type and still maintain accuracy. It has a 7 inch lightweight keymod free float handguard which gives it a nice profile to hold, it isnt as bulkey as most rails. This is a very lightweight ""Pistol"" and will be a lot of fun for the new owner. The gun is pretty much new, I just finished getting it together and decided that it was too small and lightweight for me, I am used to shooting an M16. I am asking $800 and that will include 120 rounds of 62 grain green tip, and 40 rounds of tracers (Super Fun) as well as the red dot sight! I am open to offers, I would also be willing to trade, but I need at least $500 cash no matter what the trade is.
