Cloth case. 1x magazine. Lock. Included accessories. Condition: Used but in great condition. Cash only. Have additional 600+ rounds of .22lr that I can sell you as well. PRODUCT SUMMARY: Produced in Germany, the 1911-22 from Sig Sauer is a classically styled .22 LR 1911-pattern pistol with an attractive matte Teflon-coated finish. Low-key in appearance, the pistol weighs in at 34 ounces and features subtle but significant enhancements such as an ambidextrous safety and extended beavertail grip safety for enhanced ergonomics. A skeletonized aluminum trigger, attractive grips and high-visibility, three-dot sights round out the package. (http://www.sigsauer.com)When it comes to a distinctly American autoloader, it is hard to top the classic 1911. Born from the genius of John Moses Browning and adopted by the U.S. military more than a century ago, this classic single-action defensive pistol soldiers on today in the hands of not only select military and law enforcement units, but also everyday citizens. But, feeding these .45 ACP pistols a steady diet of practice ammunition can quickly become an expensive endeavor.For those looking for a cheaper way to keep up their shooting skills with the 1911 platform, there are several rimfire variants of this classic design available on the market today. While the internal mechanical operations of these .22 LR pistols differ from the original (namely straight blowback replacing the locked breech/delayed blowback operation of centerfire variants), with similar handling characteristics and control placements they can do an excellent job of replicating the centerfire 1911 experience at a fraction of the cost. Click through the gallery above to see what options are available on the market for shooters today."

It's a beautifully finished gun and has proven exceptionally accurate. I've had the barrel dimpled by Marvin Pitts with Nefarious-Arms-LLC-Marvin-Pitts. His work brought the overall weight under 8lbs. I also had him cerakote the barrel in a very nice tungsten grey finish. The work is top notch. I've also added a PWS Fsc 762 brake and a Magpul k grip. It shoots nice and flat and is very handy with the reduced weight. I'm including the 50 rd xproducts x25 magazine. This magazine is of the highest quality. Literally the best available. Also included is a set of Diamondhead back up sights. I'm also including the original Daniel grip and flash hider (superior suppression device). All in all this is a one of a kind package that is sure to give lifetime of faithful service. I can be reached either by email or phone at 61 528 99960

Less than 30,000 of these Flat Top .44s were made from December of 1956 until 1962 when the Super Blackhawk was introduced which replaced it. This handsome .44 Magnum Flat Top was made in 1957 and purchased in October of that same year according to the ORIGINAL SALES RECEIPT and OWNERS INSTRUCTION MANUAL.   Additionally included is the RECEIPT and BOX from Ruger when the revolver was returned to the factory in 1968 for the transfer bar safety conversion Also included is the ORIGINAL REVOLVER CONVERSION INSTRUCTION MANUAL. The lockwork has been RESTORED to the original condition but all the conversion parts are included. The action has been nicely TUNED and the trigger breaks at a crisp 3 pounds.Additionally, there is the correct Hunter holster (1100-46) for the 6 1/2"" barreled .44 Flat Top.  The gun hasn't been fired much and shows holster wear mostly, although there is a blemish in the blue just above the front of the ejector rod housing as seen in the photo. It appears to be a blood stain. If interested it's best to call me at REDACTED - this is a land line so no texts. The price is $650 from an FFL, C&R, or Nevada CCW.

This Safariland holster features the Self Locking System (SLS) rotating hood system which is so well suited for the tactical situations encountered today. The hood on the Safariland 6005 holster can only be released by being simultaneously pushed down and rotated forward and actually becomes more secure when upward force is applied. The Safariland SLS Tactical Holster 6005 features a STX Tactical finish that is rugged, protecting the gun from scrapes, scratches and dents. Molded sight track and soft SafariSuede protect the gun's sights and finish. A special feature of the Safariland Model 6005 is the double leg strap and the leg shroud. These two features combined equal comfort and stability in the holster position on the leg."

First, it has the solid 3/8"" dove-tail rail, WITHOUT the scope ring cuts like the later Mark VII that has a slotted Weaver - pattern rail or the newer Mark XIX that has a Picatinny - style rail on top of the barrel. I mean, how many of us actually scope these? This one has the classic, original, clean look that we’ve all come to know and love.  Next, it has the lightest of use marks and has aged beautifully. Most likely it has 50rds or less through it, I personally haven't fired it myself. Also, it’s in .357 Magnum so you can actually SHOOT it. It won’t kill a budget like the larger calibers can. This one’s a win-win for those who want to finally own one of these iconic pistols. I had it professionally appraised yesterday and was told the gun is in 97% condition and altogether the gun with it's lower 4 digit serial #, both magazines, the case and ammo is worth $1,200 cash and as far as trade value goes $1,300 on the low end and $1,500 on the high end as a collector's grade Mark 1 I’m looking to sell because I’m going in a different direction.

Original trigger parts included. Trijicon sights. This is the 4.25"" barrel version, NOT the compact or the shield (Although I have a shield also if you'd like- great shape, Apex trigger, fiber optic sights-425 or 395 if you buy both at once). If you were looking for an M&P this is the one to get. Never carried or anything so wear is very minimal as you can see from the barrel. I'm open to trade for any of the nicer CZ-75's (SP01 Tactical or Shadow, or TS with money on top from me). I'm in LA but can travel for the right buyer, choose whichever FFL you want because you'll be paying the fees associated with the transfer. If you want to offer any other trades, keep in mind I'm ONLY looking for full size, target focused 9mms, if your gun doesn't fit that description please save us both the time."

This gun is damn near ""factory"" condition. I personally know, its had about 40-60 rounds put through it since its birth...(1981). I originally thought about 75 rounds, but I know it's less. I am the second owner. The first owner put about 40 rounds through her, and I put another 20 maybe. I also have an original box of 357mag ammo the first owner gave to me that he purchased in the 80s...The pictures will speak for themselves, and much nicer up close. I have the original box and what came with it, along with the matching serial tag. With no exaggeration, you are looking at a 99% condition gun in both frame and royal blue finish. I wont pussy foot around with her. Im asking a high but fair and going market price for this revolver, in this condition. If you go to ""Gun Broker"" they are starting the bid at around $2400-3100 and ending at 4k or more, in this condition. I have also seen them at about 90% condition or less, for a similar price. You will not find another like this, in this condition, locally. The price is firm. This gun is more for the collector at heart, and a love for this particular vintage classic. She is pristine in every aspect. The lockup is real tight and the trigger is just ridiculously crisp and smooth, as the Pythons are known for. This gun will ""NOT"" disappoint the one who loves this classic...serious inquiries only please."

Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em.

A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!
