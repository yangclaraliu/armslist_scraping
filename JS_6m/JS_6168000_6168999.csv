If you are just interested in the rifle and nothing else I will ask for $1300. The mount and cheek rest alone cost brand new around $250, and they have literally been used maybe twice at the range. The rifle has about 200 or less rounds through it and was cleaned thoroughly after each range trip. As well greased with the recommended lubriplate 130. I really love this rifle and hate to sell it, but money is extremely tight. Only selling locally here in Washington State. If you want pictures of the cheek rest and mount I will email them to you.

Included is an extra mag well insert that I purchased, just in case the one currently in it ever broke or had some sort of issue. Included is 1 promag magazine and 4 metalform magazines. I purchased the promag to function test it, so far it works great. The metalform mags are superb with zero problems. I did also try midway's colt ar 9mm mags and found them not reliable with feeding (just as an FYI). PSA has sales on metal form colt style mags (the ones included) a hand full of times per year (also just a FYI). Im looking to sell this for 600$ to help sell it quickly for moving cost coverage. Please have CPL for fast transfer. Also, I would like to transfer at Precise Shooter in Lynnwood, they are a small business that I like supporting with great transfer rates (25$ if I recall)."

$800 in cash or better in trade.  I've seen other bright polished 686 models selling for a lot higher, so price is firm.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  Please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? this makes it a lot easier when considering.  If you ask if I'm interested in a firearm worth less and make no mention of adding cash or other to make up the difference, I will politely decline thinking you want a straight trade.
The only item I'm looking for right now is a Sig P320 Compact or Carry model in 9mm + $350 with std. sights or + $300 with night sights.  
Mostly interested in semi-autos(AR & AK rifles & pistols), but will consider others firearms, depending, stripped AR lowers, nice triggers, maybe other parts.  FosTech Echo trigger or the Franklin BFS, Gen 3 only.

Used last year.  Not taken out this year.  Brand new condition.  My son no longer has interest in deer hunting.  I shoot an Optima V2 and I have no use for this extra muzzleloader.  Including tax I paid $211 for the muzzleloader and around $65 for the scope.  I've actually been very satisfied with the scope. I will take $140 for muzzleloader only or $170 for the package.  If you buy either I will throw in two  brand new full packages of Powerbelt 245 grain copper bullets.Muzzleloader season is coming up in two weeks and if you buy the package the only thing you need is White Hot pellets and 209 primers.  It is ready to go and sighted in.  Call/text/email Chris REDACTED

This was formally tapped for a scope, and among Mosin fans, it's well known that this means this rifle was initially issued as a sniper rifle. The USSR essentially had a run off of production service rifles off the rack. Opposed to making a purpose built sniper rifle, the very best shooting off the rack rifles were fitted with a bent charging handle, and tapped for a scope. In a nutshell, this rifle shot well enough to be pulled aside. Other than the bent bolt handle, and slightly smoother action, this is a typical Mosin Nagant. Bore is clean, and rifling is in very good condition. I purchased from Century Arms, and have fired under 100 rounds of non-corosive ammo. Feel free to text me, and you can see it in person.Price is flexible, but I am aware what I could get if patient enough to wait. So, please be fair."

The metal piercing pellets and the Crossman 175 pellets are largely empty. You wouldn't have liked these pellets anyway. The rest of the pellet cans are either full, or close to being full.The best pellets are the the JSB Match Diablos. They were certainly the most expensiv ones. You can get information on them at pyramydair.com.I would say the value of these pellets are about $40. Extra Scope Description -You can't put a carbine scope on an airgun. The vibration will destroy the scope, and quickly. However, you can put an airgun scope on a carbine with no problems.The extra scope I am providing is an airgun scope. This scope is really meant to be used at distances over 50 yards, where it is extremely accurate.The scope is a UTG 6-24x50. Full information/specs can be found on pyramidair.com.This scope never left my home and still retains it's original value of $129.This all is being sold ""close to new"".  The new value of the rifle, plus the new value of the scope, plus the cost of the pellets comes to about $459.  I will sacrifice it all for $200 (firm), as long as you take it all.  The extra scope is actually a decent carbine scope if you don't want to use it on the airgun."

Top choice would be a 12ga O/U, but I would consider the right semi-auto.  Want to stick to 12 ga just for consistency, as that's what my pump shoots.
Willing to look pretty much anywhere in the great Cincinnati and Dayton areas, so if you're close by I have no problem coming to you.
 
I'm not looking/able to spend a ton- would go as high as $400 for the top end of what I seek and probably lower for the gently used entry level gun I'm looking for.
 
To give an idea, models I've considered are the Stoeger Condor, ATI Cavalry.  Anything in that class would probably do me. 
 
Email is the best way to reach me and if we make a deal, I'm available to meet pretty much any time/ any day."

In 1959, the US military adopted the resultant M14. The rugged reliability of the M14 coupled with its formidable 7.62×51 NATO cartridge left an enduring impression on America’s fighting forces despite its relatively short tenure. When it was replaced in 1970, the stage was set for the next step in its history.In 1974, the Reese family ensured that the legacy of the M14 would live on. Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, Illinois began offering a civilian legal semi-automatic version known as the M1A™. Powerful, accurate and reliable, M1A’s™ were soon found dominating the National Matches at Camp Perry. Shooters across the country discovered the versatility and enjoyable satisfaction of owning an M1A™.Every accessory you need is included in this quality build!

More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip. An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. Front cocking serrations provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm, or conducting press checks. The pistol is available in 9 mm and also features low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc., P-SAIT trigger. In addition, a solid steel guide rod adds weight where it matters most."

I bought it less than 10 months ago, and have carried it on and off, but I mainly carry my glock. There is nothing wrong with this gun. It has no scratches, distinguishing marks, other than the firing marks on the chamber, which I clean, but don't remove due to the coating on the barrel. I do no want to strip the coating and then have the barrel erode over time. I have probably put around 250-300 rounds through it in total. It is a absolutely great carry gun. The gun weighs only a little over 11 ounces. So for a .357 it packs a punch, but .38's feel great in it too. I purchased it for 800 and with the holster and ammunition it cost me close to 1000 for everything.

This build just needs a few more things and it will be a nice rifle, Im only selling it to fund another project. I looking to get 800.00 for the upper and lower together. You wont find a noveske like this for the price anywhere all of the noveske builds I saw on arms list will run you about 1400 and that was the lowest.This build needs a trigger, bolt and charging handdle and comp and grip of your choice and this rifle will be ready to shoot. I paid more than what im asking for so keep that in mind when you contact me with any low ball offers. Im not going any lower than 800 so dont waste your time, if you want a lower price go buy a cheaper rifle Lol. I will not ship so don't ask and all rules apply so you will need all the right documents to buy the lower."
