The question is, which one to buy?  Most all of the VH Parkers available will have some faults to them; ie poor dimensions, repaired stocks, wrong chokes, or simply worn to the point they don’t even catch your eye.  This Parker, sn238463 made after the Remington purchase of Parker Bros. in 1935, is your gun.  ""Why?"" you ask.  First, it is a nice, untouched Parker VH 20ga. with no restoration or alteration but still retaining enough factory finish to make it an attractive vintage double.  The screws are perfect, wood to metal fit is perfect, bores are mirror shiny, and being a Remington gun it has nicer wood than most VH grade guns.  Also, it has good shooting dimensions and weighs just 6lbs. 2oz., a very lightweight Parker.  This is the kind of gun you can hunt without worry of harming its value, as it has been used and well cared for.  Hunt it, shoot it, take care of it and it will be worth more money than what you  paid for it in a year or two.  The Parker is the most notorious, classic, vintage American double gun and the 20ga. is the one everybody wants.  Nice gun, nice investment."

I have this extra trigger laying around.   Description  The Overwatch Precision TAC Trigger is a flat-faced, direct drop-in replacement for your OEM trigger. Each trigger shoe and trigger safety tab is machined in the USA out of 7075-T6 aluminum alloy, and affixed to an NP3 plated, Gen 3 OEM trigger bar by 316 Stainless Steel coiled spring pins. The trigger shoe and safety tab are both Type III hard coat anodized to MIL-A-8625 standard.   The small indexing hook ensures consistent trigger finger placement, and the broad, flat face of the trigger allows a uniquely self-correcting, straight rearward press. The flat face reduces trigger reach by 0.24"", making this an ideal option for smaller statured shooters. Pre-travel has been reduced as much as possible without compromising firearm safety features, resulting in a clean, crisp break, and reduced overtravel. Robar's NP3 plating provides virtually impermeable corrosion resistance and smooth, grit-free operation. Note that trigger pull weight does not change from factory weight with the use of this trigger alone.  End Result: This trigger is a tank. A sexy tank. Just in case you were wondering, the only difference between the Tac trigger and the DAT trigger is the small lip on the bottom of the Tac. Otherwise they are identical both form and function wise."

The 940-1, a descendant of the 940 that was introduced in 2000, has had some changes to make the 940-1 lighter while still maintaining it's durability and functionality.  One change made includes the use of American-made CPM-S90V super premium stainless steel for the blade which has a hardness rating of 59-61HRC. This steel will will offer you excellent edge retention and corrosion resistance. Another difference in this knife you will see is the use of the dual carbon fiber handles and the addition of blue anodized aluminum barrel spacers. Both of these materials make this an extremely strong yet lightweight knife.  Overall this knife is 7.87"" long and only weighs 2.44 ounces. The reverse tanto style blade is stonewashed and has a flat grind. The 940-1 has a blade that is 3.40"" long and 0.12"" thick. It has plenty of blade to utilize and the weight makes it easy to maneuver.  The contouring of the carbon fiber grips offer impressive grip handling and when the knife is open you can see straight through the handles. Overall the handle is 4.47"" long and 0.41"" thick. When opened, the blade is held in place with the AXIS® lock mechanism.  The 940-1, which is a favorite among many EDC users, has dual thumb studs for easy manual opening with either hand and a tip up ambidextrous pocket clip.  Made in the USA, the Benchmade 940-1 Carbon Fiber Folding Knife is an impressive every day carry knife that can handle multiple tasks and last. It's lightweight, easy to carry and feels good in your hand during use.

Reciever and trigger group is off of a savage 111 Hog Hunter. Has a 26 Inch Mcgowen Precision Barrel with a PRS 338 Lapua brake on the end (Still works wonders for reducing recoil, gun kicks like a 243 at the most). Stock is a MDT LSS with a Mako Group Adjustable Buttstock. I ended up building this gun myself from the action up and turned out very well. Gun shoots 1 MOA or less, and have fired about 200 rounds without any issues. Note that I am not including the scope in the deal for the listed price, unless somebody wants it. Its a vortex 4-16 FFP scope worth $700 so Its not included at the price of $1100 However, Alot of other extras are included. Comes with 1 Accuracy International mag, and 2 Magpul Mags, all 5 rounders. Have about 80 rounds of factory ammo, about 70 Rounds of HAndloads (Mix of 208gr ELD-m's and 168 gr HPBT's). Also have about 100 pieces of fired Brass which I will turn into loaded ammo in the next few days. So, about 250rds will be included with this sale. Also has a bipod and will throw in a case for it. If interested, I also have a set of reloading dies for it, as well as a barrel wrench and headspacing kit if You ever want to change out the barrel on it. Barrel should be good for another 1000-1500 rounds or so. Reason I am selling is to get money to put towards a vehicle, and possibly upgrade to a 338 Lapua or something similar. NJ Buyers prefered, must have Matching NJ DL and Firearms ID. Out of state buyers within a reasonable distance must be willing to meet at an FFl to do the transfer. Sorry no shipping, too many scammers on this site to risk it. Also, Any trade offers let me know, but most likely will only consider an upgrade to the platform I am listing here or a decent Pistol Cal carbine. Asking 1100 Firm, or 1600 with the scope included"

Aside from a Sadlak NM spring guide and a recoil buffer, it's all factory to my knowledge. I can't say how many rounds have been through the barrel as I'm not the original owner, but I can say that it's certainly broken in. With the cheapest brass ammo I can find (147gr reloads from Freedom Munitions), it's a 2-3 MOA gun and it's more than capable of hitting steel out to 700yds with the scope (Vortex HS 4-16x44) and mount (Larue LT-139) on it. They can be included too for right price."
