They both have the screw-in choke tubes. I purchased these as the opportunity came along then scoped them up with Leupold Vari-X II 3x9x40 Matte, sighted them in and they have pretty much sat in the gun safe oiled up since then. I will take the scopes & rings off if you don't want them. There is nothing wrong with either gun except you can see in the pictures where some of the bluing on the receiver has discolored or the engraving is not very pronounced. This is the condition that I bought them.*** Serious inquiries only please! I know what I have and I do not have to sell these and will let them sit in the safe!

CONDITION: VG-Excellent overall original condition. We acquired this rifle from the original owner who stated he fired it very little and had a claw mount on the rifle so there are a few minor marks on the receiver from the mount. It has minor wear around the ejection port so it obviously has not been shot more than a handful of times, bore is excellent. It has since been in my H&K Collection for many years properly maintained and climate controlled. Ships exactly as shown in the photos what you see is exactly what you will receive. I am selling off a few of my firearms from our collection so be sure to check out my other listings for some very nice collector grade weapons."

I've got a Glock 22 Gen 4 for sale. Guns in great condition and comes with some upgrades. Extended slide lock release, 3.5 lb Ghost trigger kit, trijicon night sights, and a Lonewolf match grade barrel. Stock barrel comes with it. Sadly, The gun Only comes with one magazine. For that reason only, I'm only asking 400.00 for the gun. Im very firm, I feel my price is very fair. Less than what a new one costs, plus you're getting several expensive upgrades. The gun new cost $600.00+ after taxes, the night sights were $150.00, and the barrel was $120.00.I feel that 400 is pretty fair for the gun plus extras, so im pretty firm on my price.I can be reached through the email provided on this site or by text or call at REDACTED."

One is a .22 Hornet/12 gauge and the other is .222/12 gauge. They are in great shape the way that I bought them except both guns have had their rough triggers cleaned up and are sweet. They both have the screw-in choke tubes. I purchased these as the opportunity came along then scoped them up with Leupold Vari-X II 3x9x40 Matte, sighted them in and they have pretty much sat in the gun safe oiled up since then. I will take the scopes & rings off if you don't want them. There is nothing wrong with either gun except you can see in the pictures where some of the bluing on the receiver has discolored or the engraving is not very pronounced. This is the condition that I bought them.
 
*** Serious inquiries only please! I do not have to sell these and will let them sit in the safe! The only trades that I would consider would be with a ""Quality Manufacturer"" AR15 flat-top type rifle (Colt / Daniel Defense) that either has not been shot or only very little. I am a fair and honest person and expect you to be one too or don't mess with me! ***"

It was introduced at the 2007 SHOT Show. The STG-556's working system features a bolt release as seen on the M16 rifle; otherwise, the STG-556 retains the features similar to the Steyr AUG, such as having the quick-change barrel option and the ability to change which side the weapon ejects from by changing the bolt out for a right or left side bolt respectively. There is some parts interchangeability but the rifle is not a true clone. The STG-556 ships standard with right side ejector. The STG-556 is unable to use M16-style magazines or STANAG NATO standard magazines; they use versions of a proprietary MSAR magazine resembling the Steyr mags. The current production XM-17 E4 use STANAG magazines. The STG-556 is a short-stoke gas piston. The STG-556 rifle can be converted from either having a telescopic sight or a MIL-STD-1913 rail. It is available in civilian (semi-automatic only) and military/law enforcement (select-fire) variants. A limited edition STG-556, a clone of the Steyr AUG A3, had a production run of only 1,000 rifles. There was a limited production of 232 rifles produced with an 18.5"" heavy barrel after tests proved that length provided optimum accuracy over the 24"" length due to barrel harmonics. Another limited edition Steyr AUG A3 clone, the STG-556 Gebirgsjäger, had a production run of 500"

This is not a Krieghoff. It's an old Savage shotgun that has had the barrel shortened to 18 inches, the metal nicely Cerakote'd and the stock material painted with non-slip plasti-dip. The bore is clean and bright and it shoots just fine. It's a gun you can put in the home for protection without missing the money and feeling like you need to shoot it every week to get your money out of it. It's one you modify without that feeling of dread if you aren't the greatest at cosmetic changes. I'd prefer to sell locally but will ship to FFL at buyers expense."

The Star Model B is a very close facsimile of the Browning 1911 however it has some distinct differences. The star is an all steel pistol that's well built and reliable. Purchased the gun for my wife because she likes shooting my 1911 but could not rack the slide. The Model B's slide is very easy to rack and being a 9mm it was eaiser for her to shoot. She's decided she wants a CC weapon now so we decided to sell this one. The gun is in good condition and comes with 2 10rd mags.

Even if you aren't interested in buying it, the pictures are worth looking at and that is free ;-)Designed to be small and compact for easy carry conceal or small storage areas, this Model 36 J-frame has a pinned 1.875 inch (sometimes called a 2 inch) barrel. It has 5-round capacity in a swing-out cylinder, case-hardened trigger, and case-hardened exposed hammer with single or double action. This gun has a grooved rear sight and a ramped fixed blade front sight. It features a bright shiny nickel finish and has Smith & Wesson wood grips.This thirty-two year old classic revolver is in beautiful condition. The original owner fired three cylinder's worth of rounds before storing it. I took it to the range after I bought it and fired thirty-five factory-manufactured rounds through it, keeping the total of the rounds fired through this gun at fifty.As with all of the S&W revolvers I have had the pleasure to shoot, this one is an accurate and fun gun. While this gun is pretty enough to just put up somewhere and admire, it is dependable and accurate enough to carry conceal or use as a house gun.There are a few very small light surface spots on this revolver from time in careful storage over the past more than three decades, but I am not sure any of them even show up in the non-retouched pictures. The location of the spots are mainly at the bottom of the revolver by the serial number. Please contact me for several additional pictures.Before you go any further, please verify that you meet the following conditions and are willing and able to provide verifiable contact information in your initial correspondence.I have received many inquiries, some offers, and a couple of ""I'll take it"" emails recently from folks who have not met and verified the following criteria or weren't able to buy right now, which have prevented sales to legitimate would-be purchasers.""Able to complete at this time a local face-to-face cash sale. Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID. No exceptions."""
