Less than 300 shells through. This shotgun is a beast and is as short as legally possible. 26.1"" long. FFL ONLY - NO TRADES - PRICE IS FIRM Details:The KSG ejects downward, instead of forward.  The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and has an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel.  Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 14 rounds of 12 gage 2-3/4"" rounds (7 per tube).  The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube.  The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.  The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine.  A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard.
The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser.  The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights.  Forward and rear sling loops are built in.  The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil."

Safety: Manual Thumb and Grip Length: 7.25"" Width: 1.45"" Height: 5"" Weight: 1.56 lbs.  Enter the ECO – a single-stack Officer-size 1911 that weighs in at only 25 oz. For years, the Officer model has been criticized for reliability. We have conquered that by using the latest technology and doing what others say can’t be done. The recoil system is quite unique for this style 1911 as we use a solid one-piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. 15,000 rounds! Not 500 like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. That is longevity unheard of in a production 1911. It also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil.  The lightweight 3.5-inch slide is topped with tritium night sights with our tactical rear, which allows for easy one-hand racking. The ECO barrel is a flush-cut, ramped bull barrel with a target crown rather than the traditional barrel bushing setup, allowing it to be more compact and easier to disassemble.  Trigger pull is short and crisp at 4 lbs., just like all our 1911s. It breaks cleanly, enabling the accuracy people have come to expect from a Dan Wesson. The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. The Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim-line G10 grips really plant the pistol in your hand, allowing for faster follow-up shots and better recoil control. Just like the Guardian, the ECO’s slide and small parts receive the Duty finish and it’s available in both 9mm and .45 ACP.  We set out to conquer the Officer model and did just that. The ECO is compact, extremely lightweight and raises the bar for reliability. Pick up an ECO, you won’t be disappointed.    Brand: CZ USA   Item Number: CZ 01969   UPC: 806703019697"

Date of manufacturer is hard to pin down on these, but the double hump receiver was at least mid-1930s or before, and the inertial slide release design and company name/location means its a 1909-1913 model. This gun has been reblued a number of years back, and has a nice deep blue finish on it. There are normal wear marks on the magazine tube, and some finish wear is visible on the barrel and grip. The buttstock appears to be either a custom Walnut aftermarket stock, or a factory deluxe model (im not sure which, there are no marking on it that indicate either way), with beautiful deep figure and rich burl on the right-hand side. The buttstock has some minor storage marks on the bottom. The foregrip is the traditional factory ribbed piece, and has a crack running the full length. Because it is a fully captured design, you can see the crack, but it is still solid and wont affect any operation/handling.The gun will slam fire, but it has an inertial lock, meaning unless there is a recoil impulse the gun wont unlock. This was an early safety feature designed for less than reliable ammunition in the hands of people who ran their pump actions too fast (IE, it prevents you from pulling the trigger with the bolt unlocked and a live shell in the chamber, which would cause an out of battery detonation). The system works great and is very reliable. It also has the early ""suicide"" safety inside the trigger guard, which is kind of like the M1 Garand safety in that you push it forward with your trigger finger to the fire position. The take-down mechanism locks up very tight and is in great mechanical shape.  The gun has a 30"" take-down barrel with a traditional bead sight. The magazine holds 5 shells in the tube +1 in the chamber. Chamber is the standard 2 3/4"". Bore is not perfect, but pretty darn close!I can provide more detailed pictures of anything that you want to take a closer look at.FTF in Warner Robins GA, or will ship to your FFL for cost with payment via postal money order."

As said in the title, this is an ARSENAL AK-47 Pistol. What does that mean you ask? it means that it is the most prestigeous and most highly crafted manufacturer compared to any other manufacturer of AK-variant Firearms. A brief background in Arsenal and AK-47 pistols/rifles for those that are new to this type of firearm:- Arsenal is manufactured in Bulgaria and assembled in Las Vegas, NV; Bulgaria being one of several different countries that manufacture/restore AK-variant firearms such as Romania, Russia, China, Israel, and Egypt to name a few others.- The AK-47 uses a gas piston system which is known as being one of the most reliable systems for delivery known to have ever been created. I like to reference it as the Glock of the Rifle world. You can literally throw it in nearly anything mother nature can abuse it with, except for maybe lava, and it will still function and perform very well. - The difference between an AK-47 pistol and AK-47 rifle is that the pistols come with no stock, but with usually shorter barrels on them and are usually intended for its compactness or for the purpose to convert it into a short-barreled rifle (SBR).- AK-47 firearms shoot 7.62x39 ammunition. it is a 30 caliber round that is very effective for a various different scope of uses. Alongside that, the ammo is some of the very cheapest prices in terms of cost that pale in comparison to most other rounds, even compared to the highly popular 5.56x45(AR-15) ammo. (example: 5.56x45 @ 20 rounds =8-10 USD/7.62x39@50 rounds for 11 USD)Now, to compare my Arsenal SAM7K with the original AK-47 platform. - To start, most AK-47 firearms produced were manufactured using stamping of the receivers. To sort of explain, it is a sheet of metal (bar stock) that is literally stamped using a die into the shape of the reciever. - Whereas my reciever, a milled reciever, is a block of steel that is carved out and forged, including the internals, to the shape of the reciever.  - The milled reciever is the most realiable, most accurate-shooting and most functionable method for creating recievers. That is why it comes with a higher price tag as well, but well worth the money.- The SAM7K adopted some other features from another firearm, the famoust Zastava M92 Krink Pistol. Some differences are as listed: The grip is larger, it comes with secondary safety selector integrated into the grip (which is very convenient for users, especially right handers), it comes with 2 positions for the rear sight (peep hole and Notch), and a larger bolt lever; All of which I believe really updated the soviet-era firearm to the standards of todays more modern firearms. - Normally AK-47's come with wood or synthetic wood furniture, but the SAM7K comes with a very high grade polymer, which I personally prefer and gives it a very tactical look, with an ease of maintaining. - Most AK-47's that are sold today are more often than not never fully new production. You either see refurbished firearms or a mixture between new and used parts. However, the SAM7K is 100% new-production of parts and components. It comes with a Cold hammer-forged barrel, unlike many others, which is the highest quality barrel. Also comes with a hard-chrome plated bore and chamber, and also comes with an AK scope rail integrated into the reciever for ultimate ease of mounting/unmounting scope. Thes differences are what set apart Arsenal Inc. Firearms compared to any other manufacture that dares to compete against them. Furthermore, the SAM7K is that much more modernized and functionable compared to any other AK-variant. What it comes with:- SAM7K Pistol (I have not put more than ~ 700 rounds through it and regularly maintained and cleaned) $1350- the pistol originally comes with a barrel shroud, a.k.a an impersonating muzzle break/flash hider with 0% functionality other than looks. So I took it upon myself to buy an original Bulgarian 4-piece flash hider (the most known and sought after muzzle device for AK firearms). I paid $200 for it. - In order to install the flash hider, I had the barrel shortened ~2 inches, crowned and threaded. $50- I also had the feed ramp, trigger, and bolt rails polished to have an action as smooth as glass, if not smoother. $60- it comes with 3 Magpul MOE P-mag 30 rounders. $20 a piece.- and last it comes with a single-point sling for ease and support of shooting. $50.* total value approximately $1750To wrap things up, this SAM7K is the firearm you want and need to have in your collection if you are in the market of AK-47's. you will not regret it your lifelong investment. Also, due to the rising demand of firearms in the middle east, Arsenal has announced that it will pause production of their weapons in the U.S. indefinately to keep up with their high demand of products. That means value is going up, and so is prestige and availability. Last note, please only serious inquiries. Also, the transfer fees will be due to the buyer of the firearm.Thank you, Emmanuel"
