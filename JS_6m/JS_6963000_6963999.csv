The gun is new in the box with everything that you would expect to come with it. The only thing that is different about it is the aftermarket fixed sites that are glow in the dark. A Glock chambered in this caliber is not easy to come by in Vegas, every gun shop that I tried to find one at didn't have any available. If interested call or text me at REDACTED or email me at REDACTED, serious buyers only, no checks are acceptable for payment (unless its a postal money order) due to the fact that I've already had someone try to scam me. So if anyone outside of Las Vegas NV is interested I will only accept postal money orders. Also keep in mind that the price is already listed above in the post so please don't ask what I'm selling the gun for when getting in touch with me. For local buyers payment in cash is the only method I will accept  please make sure that you have your Nevada state ID at the time of the transaction to ensure that whoever I'm selling the gun to is at least 18 years old. Also the buyer must be willing to sign a bill of sale before taking possession of the gun. For any buyers outside of Las Vegas Nevada please check your local and state laws before inquiring to make sure that this gun is legal to own where you are. All State local and federal laws apply to the purchase thank you. No sales to California, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Hawaii, or Washington DC. No out-of-state sales to anybody under the age of 21."

Up for sale is this rare Contender deluxe pistol set complete with paperwork and wood presentation box. According to the T/C records, this set was made in 1969 and is chambered in .45/.410 and .22long rifle. These sets are almost impossible to find and this one has a very low 4 digit serial number! Gun appears to be unfired and is in 99% condition. This one would be hard to upgrade. Wood is excellent and checkering is sharp and crisp. The bluing is nearly perfect except for the typical mark where the barrel attaches to the frame. The wood box is actually harder to find than the gun and is in very good condition except for some scuffs and scratches. The interior lining is very nice with the T/C logo intact. This set includes the choke tool, instruction manual, warranty information, allen wrench, and key to the wood box. These hardly ever come up for sale and are a T/C collector's dream! You could look long and hard and not find one of these. Look at my 100% positive feedback and bid with confidence. If you have questions please ask. Shipping will be $40 for this item and FFL is required. Payment by U.S. postal money order,moneygramm/westernunion is accepted for payment. Good luck!"

Ive got to pay for school, and they have to go this weekend. G17 is all stock, however it has had some work done to the stock FCG and trigger. They are highly polished, and it allows for a much smoother trigger pull, while retaining a crisp break at or around 5.5 lbs consecutively. The 1911 had had loads of work, and is hardly stock anymore. Its got a full set of Wilson Combat Springs, Hand fitted Fusion barrel link and bushing, and the lock up on this pistol is as tight as you can get it and still be reliable. Very accurate, very reliable, and a good looking gun. Custom Cocobolo laminate grips from Raasco.com, and it will come with a bag full of stock parts, and alot of brand new parts. I have the full size guide rod, bushing, and spring set along with a GI style guide rod and the 18lb Wilson set that is in it. Wilson 47D mag along with the stock mag. Hard case and all of that jazz as well. My pricing is as low as i can go, so be fair. I have over a grand invested into the 1911 now, and i am willing to take a huge loss due to the circumstances that i have to have my tuition paid by the first of july. I will go as low as $550 for the 1911 with ammo, parts, and original equipment. The glock is set at $450, a fair asking price for the quality of the weapon you will be receiving. 165 down the pipe. Three 17 round mags, one 33 round mag and all original bix and equipment. If you want to buy them both together, i will cut you a deal at $900. That gets you 2 great pistols and all original equipment, .45 ammo, and about $200 in 1911 parts. If you're a left handed shooter ill throw in a brand new Alien Gear Cloak Tuck 3.0 with the 1911."

I have original receipt, owners manual, gun lock, original Glock case and 2 clips. Bought it originally for $500 but am willing to drop it to $475 because it is technically used.
