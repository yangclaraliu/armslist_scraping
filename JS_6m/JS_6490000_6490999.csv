The G19 is a mid-size pistol, shooting the 9x19mm pistol cartridge (9mm Parabellum), a standard military round that's easy to find ammo for anywhere. The GLOCK 19 is a short-recoil operated, striker-fire semi-automatic pistol. The Safe-Action trigger system makes shooting in stressed situations infallible. The main frame of the GLOCK pistol is constructed of high-strength polymer that is resistant to shock, caustic liquids, and temperature extremes. The milled steel slide and the barrel are treated with matte black Tenifer finish for extreme resistance to wear and corrosion. The Tenifer treated steel and polymer frame make the pistol impervious to corrosion caused by perspiration and humidity when carried close to the body, or kept in a holster for extended periods of time.

The thing that made the Irish rifles special was the fact that they were never issued and sat in a warehouse until they were released. This rifle had the same thing happen, but it sat in a British warehouse instead. These were the last and the best Enfields that were manufactured, but Britian had so many others in use that they didn't need these before they adopted the FAL for standard issue. This particular rifle was thouroughly cleaned and the stock was coated with Linseed oil like it was supposed to be. I was supposed to hit it with 0000 steel wool to take the shine off, but it looked kinda cool so I left it. I'll finish it for the purchaser if they wish. Of course all of the numbers match including the stock, but there is no number on the magazine. It also has the flip-up long range rear sight. I have 148 Mk7 surplus rounds (1964), 49 S&B match rounds, and 20 Federal SP hunting rounds that I'll throw in. That's over 217 rounds if you weren't counting. If you need more pictures (I would!) or information, please don't hesitate to ask. I would be interested in trades other than firearms, I'm thinning the herd as it is."

If the add is up the rifle is available. Imported by KFS Atlanta, GA. This is a factory 386 CW- model. The ""C"" Series Polys were the rifles with the improvements  factory, spring loaded firing pin, checkered pistol grips, under folding bayonet. These rifles were only imported for two years 1988 to 1989 before the import ban. I purchased this package quite some time ago solely as an investment firearm. I'm not a big ak fan so this is only one of two I've owned, but this is one of the rolls royce of Chinese AK,S. Any polytech model now is highly collectible, especially since none have been legally imported since the end of the 80,s. Rifle comes with a certificate of authenticity from polytech illustrating the story behind this rifle from production factory and date, along with original sale date, factory it was made in. If your not familiar with polytech check out the info as it's quite the amazing story.  Rifle comes with 5 Chinese magazines, green sling, green oil container, certificate, original operator manual, and two different product brochures,original polytech tool kit still in plastic, and an original polytech box. The box doesn't appear to be the factory box as I purchased the package and the original owner had it in a wheeled hard case so a mixup must have happened when we were going through his collection of polytech rifles. Please ask any questions, I will do my best to try and answer any questions. I cannot tell you how many rounds have been down the pipe as I've never fired the rifle. I can tell you it's minimal as this rifle is in amazing shape But doesn't come with a round counter installed :) After so many years. Rifling, wood and all metal are awesome. Bright shiny bore, all metal without any rust or corrosion, blonde wood looks amazing, spikes bayonet folds and extends perfectly. Kept cleaned, oiled, in climate controlled safes since the day I had it. Would make one heck of a shooter or collector for you AK fans."

When set on 1x, the PSU provides a huge 26 degree field of view facilitating rapid “both eyes open” target engagement. Set on 1x it can be employed similar to a reflex sight, providing quick hits on multiple or fast moving targets. With the flip of a switch the magnification increases to 4x providing target identification, ranging and engagement at extended distances. A Bullet Drop Compensating reticle combined with a simple to use “no math” telemetric rangefinder provides fast and reliable hits.Built to survive harsh conditions the PSU is manufactured from a solid aluminum alloy body. The design is both shockproof and watertight. The fully multi-coated optics provides a sharp and bright image with accurate color rendition and excellent resolution. The illuminated reticle features seven intensity settings and is powered by a readily available CR2032 3-volt battery. The BDC reticle provides ballistic compensation out to 800 meters. The telemetric rangefinder allows ranging out to the same distance. Capped adjustment turrets provide quick and trouble free zeroing. Once zeroed all ballistic corrections are made using the reticle.Very compact in size, the PSU is only 7.4 inches long. Weight is just 24 ounces. Eye relief is a generous 2.75 inches. The PSU mounts easily to a MIL STD 1913 Picatinny rail and features two QD levers. These allow rapid attachment and removal, no tools required. Extremely robust, the PSU is a perfect match for an AR-15 or other Modern Sporting Rifle. Magnification easily changes from 1x to 4x 32mm objective provides a large Exit Pupil Very wide field of view Compact size, only 7.4 inches long Illuminated 800 meter BDC reticle Illuminated 800 meter telemetric rangefinder Seven intensity settings Power provided by common CR2032 battery Only 24.6 ounces with QD mount Fits Mil Std 1913 Picatinny rail QD levers for rapid on/off Shockproof and watertight construction--------------Specifications--------------Magnification: 1x and 4xField of View 1x: 26Field of View 4x: 6.5Exit pupil: 8mmEye relief: 70mmAdjustment range of the sight by height: +0-10 mils, min.Adjustment range of the sight by direction: +0-10 mils, minThe height of optical axis to the seat plane: 37.5mmPower supply: CR2032 3VOverall dimensions: 7.5x3x3 inWeight: 24.6 oz."

(serial number MH043xx) Buyer beware, because Colt started making new Sporter's a few years ago, and they look very similar to the originals, but they are not the same quality. The new ones can be had for about $900, and I have noticed that some of the new ones are being sold/represented as one of the older original Sporter's, or Pre Ban Sporter. A preban Sporter is one that was made prior to the assault rifle ban law of 1984, which expired in 1994. Because it may be hard for a novice to tell the difference, I recommend getting the serial number and calling Colt to verify the date of manufacture. The book value for my rifle, which was made in 1992, which makes it an original Colt Sporter Heavy-Barrel Match rifle, is $2,150 to $2,350.

Cal: 30-06
Scope: Redfield 3x-9x
From the beginning, the Ruger M77 was intended as a modernized Mauser 98, though numerous changes were made. Bill Ruger wanted to use investment casting in place of a forged receiver. The Sullivan-designed bolt dispensed with the Mauser blade type ejector and instead used the simpler plunger style of ejector. A two-position tang safety and redesigned trigger system were also designed from scratch.
Perhaps the most novel feature of the M77 is the only one that has not been redesigned, the angled action screw. The front action screw of traditional bolt-action rifles draws the receiver directly down against the stock. The M77 uses an angled screw that draws the action down and to the rear, tightly bedding it against the stock."

The ""Closest"" operating mode distinguishes near and far objects and identifies the closest target, and the ""Farthest"" mode allows you to lock on the farthest target and shoot distant features through brush and foliage. ""Continuous"" mode provides constant updates while locking on multiple targets. The TruPulse also features a ""Brush Filter"" mode. The TruPulse's diopter adjustment allows for comfortable viewing even for eyeglass wearers. An RS 232 serial port allows for data downloading.

I am asking $300 (firm) with the buyer paying the transfer fee at a shop local to the York area. Since this is a handgun, it must be transferred at an FFL. If you are unable to pass a background check, please do not contact me. I will not ship this firearm."
