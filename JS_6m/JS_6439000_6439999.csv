Selling my Nighthawk Custom GRP Recon 1911 made by RWA ** Airsoft Pistol ** , this is an extremely limited production and very high-end build…anyone that wants an elite Airsoft or Training Pistol this is fantastic…I had a professional gunsmith mill three top vents into the mill, this give a quicker cycling and also allows for more shots per magazine. This has been used about a dozen times…and is in fantastic condition overall…you’ve never experienced an Airsoft or Training Pistol like this one before.
 
I can give more pictures and more details to anyone that would like them.
 
It comes in a custom wooden display box with the certificate of authenticity…I also have a custom Pelican 1490 case made for this…the foam was cut with a waterjet for a perfect fit. I also have a custom battle-belt made for this setup that holds the pistol, a Cold Steel practice knife, and 6 total magazines. It is made with very strong carbon fiber style Kydex, really well made!

Nighthawk Custom GRP Recon 1911 made by RWA Airsoft: $1400
RWA CO2 1911 Metal Magazines: $30 each x 6 = $160

Stock has been finished beautifully to show grain. All numbers are matching other than bolt. Bore is decent with deep sharp rifling intact. Bluing has typical surplus wear. Neat old military rifle with powerful ammo that won't break the bank!More information on the M53:The Chinese Type 53 Carbine is one of the more interesting of the Model 1944 Carbine clones; however, the Type 53 has never been sought out on a wide scale by Mosin Nagant collectors. The main reason for this folly is the false notion that the Type 53 is of inferior quality when compared to its counterparts. Nothing could be further from the truth, but this very common opinion still seems to dominate collectors circles. The quality in manufacture of the Type 53 is quite high and the Type 53's place in history rivals any of the Model 1944's. In fact the combat use of the Type 53 may well be greater than any of the M44's. The overall accuracy of the Type 53 is in line with the other M44's on the market. Some are excellent shooters while some are truly horrible. This is not just the case with the Type 53 but all the M44 carbines ( really all surplus firearms in general ). Because of this it is impossible to make blanket statements on accuracy. Maybe the buyer will get lucky and get a ""tack-driver"" and maybe the buyer won't. The Type 53, like all the M44's, are fun to shoot IF one can tolerate a rather heavy amount of recoil.  The Type 53 may well be the best bargain of the M44 Carbine types on the collector's market.  It is indeed a lot of carbine for the money and really belongs in any Mosin Nagant collection. The black-eye that it has received in many circles is undeserved and this can work to the collector's advantage. Ignore the bogus information and the collector can make out like a bandit.The Original Lincoln Pawn & Jewelry of Spring Lake Park8480 Central Ave NESpring Lake Park, MN 55432www.LincolnPawnShop.com"

Also, the company supports the Navy SEAL Foundation. My Honor Guard model has only been factory test fired, and is the one with FIST (Firearm with Intergrated STandoff) frame. FIST helps keep the pistol in battery when you are in cqb. For example, You can jam the gun into your foe and fire without taking it out of battery. You can also use the FIST as a stabilizing brace. Honor Defense is the only manufacturer that offers this type of configuration. The HG is about the size of a Shield, has features like ambi controls, no snag sights, wrap around front press check serrations, and a very unique and comfortable grip pattern.

Got for sale a 1975 High Standard Citation with a Volquarsen Custom Match barrel with Compensator. This Citation is one of the last great High Standards made in Hamden CT, before they moved to East Hartford. I had this barrel specifically made for Bullseye by Volquartsen Custom and it's a one-of-a-kind. I had them cut the barrel to 6-1/2 inches to include the compensator. I had them flute the barrel to remove some weight and it's a real tack-driver! The barrel has a Volquartsen scope mount, and included is a 30mm Silver UltraDot optical sight. The barrel sides were slabed to match the original High Standard barrels, and the weight holes under the barrel added. An extra hole was added to the top of the barrel to position the scope mount further back to change the balance if you like, but you must remove the rear sight then. This barrel provides you flexibility with however you want to set it up. The barrel will fit any push-button High Standard 106 or 107 models. I originally had it on a 107 Trophy. Price is $850 firm! Willing to ship provided it goes through an FFL, and it's legal to own in your state. Would prefer a WI sale and local pickup. Must send payment and FFL before I will ship. Add an additional $40.00 for shipping."

That caliber was first used in 1960, and the * over R is the inspector mark of Sylvain Wagemans who worked at the Liege Proof House between 1951 and 1965. That means this was made between 1960 and 1965. Back then they were actually hand built to order on a FN Mauser action with a jeweled bolt, and I haven't seen another one with the muzzle break on it. There is some very light pitting on the top of the barrel but none under the wood. The bore is spotless!It has a Burris 6X Signature scope with perfect optics, and a nice vintage leather strap too. I have 1 vintage box and 4 new boxes of Norma factory ammo with the 180gr Oryx bullet for a total of 100 rounds. The ammo is suitable for large game and the brass is some of the best made for reloading. If you want it shipped it would need to be in 2 packages.

The SAS operating system is a unique blend of gas and inertia, where a gas piston moves only one inch to kick the bolt rearward and start the bolts inertia travel through the operating cycle; fewer moving parts provides higher dependability. The SAS gas/inertia system operates dependably with most commercially available 2.75"" and 3"" shells and a special gas piston is included for use when firing the new ultra-high energy 3 magnum ammunition currently on the market. The gas/inertia action is housed inside a receiver machined from 7075 aluminum finished in a high gloss black anodizing. The SAS 28"" barrel is chambered for both 2.75"" and 3"" shells and features a full length ventilated rib and screw-in chokes; three chokes (F, Mod and IC) are included. The barrel finish is high gloss black chrome to match the receiver. Magazine capacity is 4+1 rounds, but with a magazine plug included to limit the capacity to 2+1 rounds. Total weight is approximately 7.75 lbs. Also comes with a Master Trigger Lock"

Some states have enacted laws that restrict common features, including a pistol grip and adjustable stock. Somehow they believe that these features make firearms more dangerous. For law abiding citizens that own these weapons, it could mean confiscation and possibly criminal prosecution. The FRS-15 Rifle Stock is designed help law abiding citizens keep their firearms in compliance with these laws. Replacing the pistol grip and adjustable stock with the FRS-15 rifle stock, effectively eliminates these two prohibited characteristics while preserving all of the weapons functionality. It took nearly two years of research and development for the FRS-15 Rifle Stock to reach its current form. It is an excellent blend of form and function. Shooters of all types will appreciate the feel of its traditional hunting rifle style curved grasp and solid shouldering.
