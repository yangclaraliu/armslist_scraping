The SBX features a more slim design with a thicker strap for extra stability. This veteran-designed and U.S.-manufactured accessory enhances accuracy and reduces felt recoil when using an AR-style pistol. Made from high-quality, elasto-polymer, the SB15 is manufactured to close tolerances and fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0” – 1.2” in diameter. The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the operator’s forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user. Features: Fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0"" - 1.2"" in diameter. ATF compliant* Veteran designed Made in USA Quick and easy to install * ATF has reviewed this product and determined that attaching the SB15 to a firearm does not alter the classification of the firearm or subject the firearm to NFA control.If you don't care for the pink color.

I bought this firearm new in early 2016 so it's about a year an a half old. I never did feel comfortable carrying it as my concealed weapon so it sat clean in my safe unless we went to the range; which meant have been a whole whopping 2-3 times.  I would say an estimated round count of it would be about 70-100 rounds. It came with the night sights pre installed from T&K outdoors in Spartanburg and can show proof of purchase when original cost was 579.99 plus tax. The gun will come with a black glock carrying case, a glock pin punch tool, 1 magazine, and 50 rounds of .40 cal hollow point ammunition. This gun shows very little sign of wear due to the little amount of usage. I feel this is a great deal to someone looking for a full size handgun, because you can't beat a Glock for the price.

A frontier favorite since its debut, this lever-action rifle was produced in a number of variations from short Trapper models and carbines to short and extra-long barreled rifles. A few short years after the 1873 rifle was introduced it was often teamed with the famed 1873 Peacemaker and other sixguns that had been chambered for the '73's .44-40 (.44WCF), .38-40 (.38 WCF), and .32-20 (.32 WCF) ammunition. The premier choice of the post-1874 Texas Rangers, this slab-sided saddle rifle was also favored by such well-known Westerners as Pat Garrett, William F. Cody, Montana Rancher Granville Stuart, and outlaws Butch Cassidy, Belle Starr and Billy the Kid"

It also has trijicon night sights with a front slide dovetail cut for easy sight changes unlike a regular 92. Has a blued stainless marked barrel and a steel guide rod unlike the plastic in a normal 92FS. Lastly the barrel does not extend past the slide like on a regular 92FS.All in all this is a specialized and highly sought after version of the Beretta 92FS series. It's in shooter condition very clean and perfectly reliable with light wear and no rust. It's a great weapon and will be around when we are all long gone.Many more pictures of the pistol available via email or text.I have installed Hogue grips on the pistol but I saved the factory vertec panels and it also includes a spare guide rod and spring, extra magazines, and a safariland drop leg holster that fits the pistol with or without a tactical light.FOID and handgun wait required. I will print out an ISP transfer form and make you a spare copy. I will ship FFL to FFL for 40 dollars extra. You literally will have to ship me cash to get me to ship the pistol due to the tons of scammers and frauds on armslist. Private sales are face to face for cash outside a gun store/range for safety."

Suitable collector credentials does not mean that one 'has a bunch of guns'. It means that one is experienced in original American Indian artifacts, and that one owns ANTIQUE pistols in the multi thousand dollar range. Please message me if you are interested. This piece is EXACTLY what I say it is.>>>This is an exceptional 1858 Remington Army .44 percussion pistol. Used by the Union Army during the Civil War and has quite visible inspectors marks. While original Indian decorated stocks on rifles are occasionally seen, in more than fifty years of collecting antique percussion weapons this is the only original Indian decorated pistol I have ever actually seen in real life, and it unquestionably saw battle during both the Civil War and the Indian Wars. It is well used but indexes and locks up solidly. It WOULD fire but is not being sold for use and there are no warranties as to use of any kind. There are six brass inlays on each grip. Five on each side are star shaped grommets, while the sixth on each side are thumbwheels from a small oil lamp of the period with some of the markings on them present. A thumbwheel is what is used to raise and lower the wick. They are from an early Holmes, Booth, and Haydens kerosene lamp, and show some of the markings and patent date. As the Indians did not use kerosene lamps in their villages these thumbwheels were likely taken off of a lamp that was destroyed during an Indian raid on a settler's wagon or home. The grips are in good condition considering their heavy usage. One heel chip is missing, and the other was chipped and repaired in the 19th century with brass nails. We virtually never know where a gun might actually have been used, or who might have used it. But this exceptionally rare piece certainly originally saw Union usage and likely was taken from the hand of a dead soldier at some point and later from the hand of the Indian who had carried it through wars and battles. In Indian ownership this would have been a highly prized item. A brave might have owned a rifle but nothing like this, and it would have likely been owned and carried by a tribal Chief. While Indians used rifles for both combat and hunting, a pistol, like a war club, was used almost exclusively for close up point blank combat and execution of wounded enemies. This is an exceptional pistol and would grace any museum level collection. You'll not likely ever see another. Please email any questions. Trades for antique pre 1898 weapons are possible. Thank you."
