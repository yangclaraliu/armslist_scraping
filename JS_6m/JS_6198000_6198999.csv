This package contains everything you need to carry the LCR concealed. Included in this pacakge is the revolver, IWB holster, 3 speed strips and 20 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense ammo. As for the LCR itself, it has under 200 rounds fired through it. Primarily, it was used for daily carry for years with an occasional trip to the range twice a year. The pistol is in excellent working order and is well maintained. There are some signs of slight holster wear on the tip of the muzzle. This revolver has been sitting in my climate and humidity controlled safe for over a year. I have other carry guns now and like most of you, would rather sell this to make room in my safe and get something else. Here is the list price of all the contents:* Ruger LCR 38 +P Revolver - $436 on Buds Gun Shop* Uncle Mike's IWB Holster - $15 on Gander Mountain* Bianchi Speed Strips - $12 on Amazon.com* 20 Rounds of Hornaday Critical Defense - $20This is $483 I have in the gun. My asking price represents a 30% discount on what I paid and $55 less than any other listing on Armslist (usual ask is $400). Therefore, my price is firm. Please don't offer anything less. I am also not interested in trades or cash + ammo. I conduct all my transactions at Young Guns in Apex, NC. I will need your DL and take a picture of your CCW. I don't accept pistol purchase permits. I will leave you with a bill of sale for both our records."

406,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6198406,For Sale:  Sig Sauer SB15 Brace with Midwest Industries Buffer Tube,"Apex, NC, Raleigh / Durham / CH, North Carolina",$ 75,"Listed On: Sunday, December 18, 2016",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is a Sig Sauer SB15 Brace and a Midwest Industries pistol buffer tube. The MI buffer tube is specially milled for the SB15 brace. Not only will the brace fit right and snug, but the tube also has a shoulder milled into it to give the brace a few extra inches off the tube for further stabilzaiton. Most pistol buffer tubes are too narrow and the brace butts up against the lower receiver of the AR. The end result is a clunky AR pistol with a loose spinning brace that you have to reset after every shot. If you are doing your first AR pistol build, then this is the kit you want. Don't make the same mistakes everyone else makes and buy a cheap tube.I recently received my Form 1 for the host receiver this was mounted on. As such, I no longer need this.Here are the prices I paid:* Sig SB15 Brace - $139 on Brownells* Midwest Industries AR Pistol Buffer Tube - $42 on MidwayUSAAdd $10 for shipping and you are in for over $190. My asking price represents an almost 60% discount over what you would pay for both of these. As such, my price is firm. Please don't offer anything less than my asking price. I am not interested in trades or cash + ammo. I do all my transactions at Young Guns in Apex, NC."

This heavy-duty floor is essentially a 3/4""-thick slab of dense, recycled rubber. The flooring inherits the superior resilience and durability of polymer bonded crumb rubber and can withstand heavy impacts and abrasive conditions. Being made from these materials, this rubber flooring mat is a great option for eco-minded consumers, as using these materials makes production cheaper, more energy efficient, and keeps landfills all over the country free from pollution and overcrowding. Even though the materials used to construct these protective mats were recycled, they sacrifice nothing in terms of durability or longevity. The mats are incredibly sturdy, long lasting, and reliable.These protective mats doubly function to cushion objects like dropped barbells and industrial equipment from hard floors. This rubber flooring mat also possesses shock-absorption traits that can reduce vibrations and noise emanating from machines. These mats will not only protect your expensive equipment, but will serve to preserve the lifespan of your subfloors by preventing damages such as cracking. Available in three great sizes, this heavy-duty floor is great for covering any-sized surface, whether it is an entire room or an individual workspace. The mat will stay down underneath its own weight once laid in place, and is easy to maintain with a mop, broom, hose, and common household cleaners.Each 4ft-by-6ft mat weighs about 100lbs, no need for adhesive or installersEasy maintenance and installation to cut down on costs now and in the futureDesigned with a mesh-textured subsurface that prevents the mat from skiddingMade of polymer bonded recycled rubber derived from tires for their all-weather durability and resilienceConstructed with thick and dense rubber for superior floor and equipment protectionThese are a heavy duty rubber mat for floors that need protection or buffering. It is designed as a floor armor mat for use in industrial, pet-care, and fitness applications. This rubber mat can protect floors from damage usually caused by the impact from dropping barbells, industrial equipment, or to protect the equipment from an inhospitable concrete floor. The rubber mats have cushioning features that protect parts and sub-floors from dings, scuffs, and other damage. The 3/4 inch thick rubber provides superior wear life compared to thinner or other lighter-duty matting. Material: 83% Post-Consumer Recycled Rubber Content Size: 4ft x 6ft x Thickness: 3/4 inch Weight: 4.025bs/Sqr ft Surface: Flat on one side, Mesh texture (anti-skid) on the reverse.

Each mat is fabricated from thousands of rubber granules and offers superior underfoot comfort and resilience. Installation: For installation in spots or wall to wall flooring product. Permanent installation of this product is not necessary since the weight of the mat (100 lbs. in a 4ft x 6ft) is usually more than sufficient to keep itself in place.

Indoor / Outdoor: The high content of EPDM, a UV stable elastomer makes this product ideal for INDOOR and OUTDOOR applications. Cleaning: This mat can be cleaned using any everyday household cleansers or cleaning implements. Indoor cleaning involves a broom, damp mop, or a vacuum.

Beretta is considered the largest barrel maker in the world. No one is dedicating such care to selecting the barrel steel. Steelium is the production technology of Beretta barrels that transforms the special tri-alloy steel into an exceptional barrel. The deep drilling, cold hammer forging and the special vacuum distension, causes the steel to acquire the ideal characteristics, offering the best ballistic performance. Steelium Pro uses a lengthened forcing cone and improved bore dimensions to reduce recoil and muzzle rise. The result is improved pattern performance that allows the DT11 to achieve superior target crushing shot-to-shot accuracy.
