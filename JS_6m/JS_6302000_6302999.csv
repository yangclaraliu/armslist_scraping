I can meet you at Ammo Bros or Turners in the nearby area (local only no shipping).INFORMATION FROM ZEV WEBSITE:Zev Technologies» Match Grade drop-in Glock¬ replacement barrels feature extremely tight tolerances and are manufactured with pre-hardened chromium stainless steel (416R) that was originally designed for use in Match Grade rifle barrels. This material provides high tensile strength and toughness to withstand typical chamber pressures while still being highly corrosion resistant.ZEV Match Grade barrel bores are some of the most precise in the industry. Every barrel is double honed (rough and finish) until a minimum surface finish of 16 RA is reached. During this process the barrels are held to a final dimension of +/- 0.003"" for consistency and accuracy.The barrels are cut rifled and 100% inspected for groove dimensions and broach finish.Raw Stainless Steel"

   These should make great, match grade uppers ready for that SPR or long range build.  Barrel extension fit was snug on all uppers.
   I’m selling for $80 each face to face.  I’ll ship for $7 more. 
 I can combine multiple units to save on shipping but I'm not lowering the individual price.  I only have 3 left.

Why in the hell would I want to pay you more than a new one?  And then you have all the ones for trade usually nothing specific because they are hoping for some goldmine trade that's completely unimaginable. The ones that do have listed as trade want guns once again are worth more than the glock would be even if it was new.   Calm down morons and realize you have a glock not a colt python it's not that expensive and are a dime a dozen all over the country. And FYI 90% of all dealers sell all calibers of glock around same price so a 19 and a 21 are same price.  All the bartering has been destroyed here with all the crap.
