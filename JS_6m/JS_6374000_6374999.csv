(November 16, 2015) — SIG SAUER, Inc., changed the way the world looked at handguns with the introduction of the modular P250® series. Now, with the introduction of the P250-22, that same versatility is available in a rimfire option.Built on the same platform as the centerfire P250 variants, the P250-22 offers an affordable option for plinkers, instructors, and newer shooters. Chambered in the venerable .22LR cartridge, the P250-22 is a reliable, fun-to-shoot handgun for all levels of shooter. “The real benefit to the P250-22 lies in its ability to be converted to fire centerfire rounds, such as 9mm, .40 or .357SIG,” said John Brasseur, Director of Product Development for SIG SAUER, Inc. “This allows newer shooters to work up to the more powerful cartridges, and is a great tool for introducing youth to the shooting sports.” The P250-22 features the same serialized fire control group as on centerfire models. This unit is the actual “firearm” and can be installed in a variety of grip modules. This versatility allows the P250-22 to be fit to any hand, and with the addition of an X-Change kit, can be converted to centerfire. Full-size, compact, and subcompact X-Change kits mean the P250-22 can be set up as a centerfire duty pistol, concealed carry gun or backup piece in seconds. The smooth double-action only trigger offers a consistent, clean trigger press, which stays the same regardless of the caliber or configuration. “The P250-22 is truly a ‘one-gun’ solution,” Brasseur said. “Thanks to the wide variety of caliber and grip module options, the P250-22 can meet any need and fit any hand.”"

There were only three general models of SKS that used AK magazines from the factory as well as a Paratrooper sub model.... the D model which was only imported one or two years and had a bayonet on it and the old mil SKS stock... and the Sporter, which was basically an M model with a goofy thumbhole stock and the M model which had a Monte Carlo type wood stock and either a un finished bayonet lug or no lug at all. The M model was also only imported for two years before it too succumbed to the Clinton ban in 94 . This rifle hasn't been shot much, maybe 200 rnds...has been a Safe Queen for years. It has matching numbers on the bolt and receiver. The only alterations to this rifle have been a weaver style rail installed on the rear bolt cover and a red/green dot sight added. This particular one has an unfinished bayonet lug. When I got this rifle it had a Dragonov style stock on it... I didnt like the stock and looked for months for an original wood stock for this model rifle... and paid through the nose for it... it looks better than with the Dragonov aftermarket and it's correct. With the rifle is included 3 - 30 rnd steel AK mags. Any factory steel AK mag fits this rifle... many of the plastic aftermarket ones dont fit well. Also included is half a case of Golden Tiger 7.62x39 FMJ... (500 rnds of one of the best quality 7.62x39 out there ) I'll also throw in 200-250 rnds of Tulammo brand 7.62x39FMJ.... thats like 300.00 worth of ammoI prefer a straight cash deal but will consider trading for a good Remington 700 bolt action or equivilant  with heavy barrel in .270, 7mm Rem Mag,  .308 or 300 Win Mag . Serious Offers Only... I wont ship this rifle, can possibly meet serious buyer part way. No tire kickers please. If you're reading this, you know it's rare and getting harder to find all the time... I'm not giving it away, but I really dont particularly need it and I'm not really into semi auto rifles anyway. Only reason I have the SKS is... it's 7.62 and has that .30 cal ""punch"" and it's 100% reliable .  Text or Call 417- eight 9 three, 9 one 8 one or send a message to REDACTED"

READ OUR FEEDBACK AND BID WITH CONFIDENCE.Steve ""Yeti"" Fisher formerly of Magpul Dynamics was instrumental in the design and testing of the Shadow Hawk. Pulling from his background in Law Enforcement, training and his passion for competition allowed a truly special pistol to be formed. The Shadow Hawk is a unique blending of the Craftsmen at Nighthawk Custom, and the electronic sight option from Trijicon(r) Attention to detail starts with the one piece machined steel magwell / mainspring housing for quick sure reloading of the Shadow Hawk. You will notice the chiseled look and feel of the black flat faced trigger preferred by competition shooters. The gun is topped front and rear with Heinie Ledge Black Tritium sights. Your hands will quickly notice the high undercut on the trigger guard along with 25 LPI checkering on the front strap. The high beaver tail will amaze you with the almost seamless fit and finish.

There seemS to be as many scams on Armslist as there are actual sellers so I plan to protect myself. Be ready to exchange phone numbers if you want to do business. I am prepared to pay with cash if local or postal money order if out of state shipping to my FFL. Dealers are fine as long as your price is in line. I do have some desirable Chinese Pre-Ban AK's and other trades if you prefer trades or partial trades. I am only looking for very good to excellent condition UZI's. I plan on making a purchase soon so do not please make contact promptly if you have something I may be interested in. I am also looking for an IMI UZI Pistol. Thanks for looking."

The end result is you get to count the metal mags as 1 922r compliance part. (every little bit helps)There is also a peep site on the rear and wire ""+"" site on the front; but I mostly used the eotech.  (NOTE: The eotech needs to be re-adjusted as it was moved from another rifle to this one when the original was stolen)."

Remember, chrome-lined barrels are “mil-spec”, which means the lowest bidder built it.  VooDoo Innovations Mid Length Piston Kit is a short stroke free floating piston system that is self-cleaning. Carbon and gases are expelled forward, away from the operator.  It is corrosion resistant and harmonics are not transferred into the barrel.  Adjustable gas settings for various applications.  Doesn't vent directly to atmospheric pressure; this eliminates flash signature and super sonic crack which is optimal for night vision and suppresses fire. – $588Fortis REV2 14” Key-Mod Handguard is an extremely lightweight yet robust free floating rail system. Fortis managed to reduce as much weight as possible while maintaining strength by utilizing a 1 piece body design.  KeyMods are at the 3, 6, & 9 o'clock positions for modularity and additional weight savings.  Its unique mounting system captures a standard AR15 barrel nut for easy installation.  It is also piston compatible, which is important for this build and it has anti-rotation tabs. Total weight is 9oz. - $200PDW Style Stock is a retractable stock made to elevate 5.56 carbines, making them compact, measuring 3” shorter than traditional carbine stocks. Utilizing a proprietary, patent pending spring, the refined design makes the M7A1 PDW Stock rugged, reliable and sturdy. The design of the rods allows full access to operating features, even with a gloved hand, and even when the stock is completely retracted. After depressing a lever on the underside of the stock with their thumb, operators can extend the stock in one fluid motion. The stock has 6 positions of adjustment and built-in sling mounts, making it the total package. - $200Strike Industries King Comp features large dual chamber design, which was engineered to reduce felt recoil and help reduce the side concussion with the specifically angled gas ports. To top it off, the K-Comp features 4 serrated prongs provide some flash suppression. The K-Comp is a great alternative if you're looking for a cross between a compensator and a muzzle brake or effective combo muzzle device. In an independent study, the Lantac Dragon muzzle device was able to reduce recoil by 62.54% and in the same test, the King-Comp reduced recoil by 60.42%. - $40ATI Scorpion X2 Grip creates optimal distance from the grip to the trigger to fit your hand. The Scorpion X2 features a rear tang that makes for consistent hand placement and reduces muzzle lift. The grip helps enable the shooter to keep elbow tight to the body even with body armor or fully collapsed adjustable stock, and elevates hand to the perfect height. It’s listed as one of the “Best Rated Products” on the Optics Planet website. - $306061 Aluminum Flip up Front and Rear Iron Sight Set with Dual Diamond Aperture - $50The HIPERTOUCH® EDT3 fire-control drop-in is a high performance, high precision, service rifle upgrade and recommended for AR-15® and AR-10® type rifles. The HIPERTOUCH® name is short for HIgh PERformance TOUCH and EDT for Enhanced Duty Trigger. The EDT3 features a duplex, or two-position trigger bow. Place the finger high in the curve and the pull weight is approximately 5 or 6 lbs with the supplied red hammer spring installed. Or, with the finger riding low on the vertical tip, the weight is approximately 4 or 5 lbs. when the supplied green hammer spring is installed. This trigger is directed to DMR use. Run the finger high in tactical situations, or run it low in longer range precision scenarios. It’s also appropriate for home defense and hunting applications as the trigger weight is higher than the 24 series triggers. It’s the “AR” fire-control upgrade we’ve all dreamed of.  - $100Safety – The Defense Package ambidextrous safety is a high precision component.  Machined from a single block of high carbon steel on a CNC mill, this will improve the feel of your safety mechanism, and it installs in minutes and can be customized to fit your strong side.  It is Cerakoted for years of dependable use, Defense Package is licensed to use Magpul Cerakote finishes, which perfectly match Magpul accessories. Also included with the safety is a high-precision safety detent, a new detent spring, and a hex wrench for installation. These can be ordered as a standard throw, 90-degrees between safe and fire, or with a 30% shorter throw, for quicker transitions - $30Seekins Trigger Guard - The Seekins Precision Billet Trigger Guard is a functional upgrade for any mil-spec lower receiver. Machined from a solid piece of 6061-T6, the profile and size accommodate thicker gloves while maintaining precise trigger control. It’s easy to install and securely attaches with a retention screw and eliminates the gap between the receiver and mil-spec trigger guard. This upgrade should be standard on any AR build! - $25Mag Release – I’m using an Odin Works XMR-2 mag release, which features a large surface area for quick mag reloads.  It’s easy to reach with a very ergonomic design.  You’re able to release the mag without changing your grip or position.  It’s contoured for positive depression and reduced slip.  It’s made from aluminum weighing .1oz and features a simple drop in installation. - $25BAD Lever – I install a BAD Lever, or battery assist device or what some call an Extended Catch on all of my rifles now.  It allows for right handed operation of the bolt catch with your trigger finger making reloads faster.  I usually go with Magpul, but I decided to try a different manufacturer this time and I chose Selway Armory on this build.  It’s thicker than the Magpul and in my opinion it sits a bit higher, which is great.  It feels more natural.  I like Magpul, but give other manufacturers a chance. - $25AXTS Charging handle – I splurged on the charging handle because I’ve owned one in the past.  The Raptor™ ambidextrous charging handle by AXTS. The Raptor™ is truly revolutionary in design & function. From rapid palm “blading” or finger thumb charges of the weapon, the motion is fluid and fast from either strong or support side. Made in the USA from aircraft grade 7075 aluminum and this one has been anodized in FDE. - $100Noveske NSR Rail Cover and Handstop Panel Kit – I always put a handstop on my handguards.  Handstops keep your support hand in the same place when holding the rifle for consistency when bringing the rifle up quickly on a target and shooting.  The Noveske kit is low profile to provide a slim and comfortable grip.  It is slightly textured for a positive grip and attaches KeyMod slots. - $30Paracord – The paracord is something different for me.  I’ve used it on one of my rifles in the past, purely for aesthetics, but this time it actually serves a purpose as well by keeping the remote switch for the PEQ held tightly in place against the handguard.  It also enhances my grip on the handguard.The Forward Assist and the Buffer Tube are purely aesthetic and are just stock parts that have been Cerakoted Magpul FDE. - $50As you can see, I have over $1,700 in this rifle. I have put just under 300 rounds through this rifle.Looking for a Salient, LVOA Warsport, or Cobalt Kinetics Rifle.  I will add $$ to make the deal work!THE PEQ AND MRO ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE SALE PRICE"

All you need to do is take your barrel and recoil spring/guide rod assembly and put it in the slide. All other internals were included. Visit their website if you are more curious about it. I have an extra barrel and recoil assembly but will sell that separate if interested. I live between Daytona and Orlando and do not want to travel far to sell. Text REDACTED

Ruger MK 3 , 22/45 Lite for SALE ONLY, no trades please, Comes as a package dealI was inspired to make this gun by 22 Plinkster on Youtube, everything short of a paintjob is based on that idea.One owner, bought just a few months ago from Scheels in Omaha. Threaded barrel model. Comes with hogue grips, and many more upgrades.  Gun functions properly, no cosmetic or internal issues to speak of. I do have an assortment of Tandem Cross parts that go with it. If you see it on tandemcrosses website its probably on this gun, spent over 225 on the custom parts kits from them to get this thing running like a real gun instead of some California compliant monster. I plan to purchase a different version of the gun in the future but right now I am tight on cash and need the cash more than the 22. I paid 475 for this gun just a few months ago, 60$ last week to have it fine tuned by a gunsmith, 225 for custom parts packs. If your interested I am looking to get 570 for the gun as this is over 25% off 760$ and that is what I would hope to pay for it used If I were looking to buy it. Very Lightly used at all, many new internals upgraded with Titanium so it should last you a life time.Will take best offer! Email with any questions you may have. The holo sun optic can also be had for nearly half off if your intrested. Comes with its box and all that good stuff.
I will drive out to meet you wherever is convenient for you.  If you have any questions feel free to email me and I will get back to you asap.

The ballistic filler consists of 13 plies of 14 oz/yd2 (457g/m2) water repellent treated Aramid Kevlar 29 fabric. The inner and outer cover, shoulder pads and front closure flap of the vest are water repellent treated 8oz/yd2 (271 g/m2) ballistic nylon cloth. The outer cover is woodland camouflage printed and the inner cover is olive green. The vest has a 3/4 collar, pivoting shoulder pads, two front pockets, two grenade hangers and rifle butt patches at the front shoulder area. The front flap and pocket flaps have hook and loop fastener tape closures. The side overlaps are made flexible through the use of 1-1/2 inch (3.8cm) wide elastic webbing.The PASGT Vest has an increased ability over the now obsolete nylon vest to stop or slow down fragments; it will reduce the number of wounds, especially serious and lethal; from exploding conventional and improved conventional munitions. When the PASGT Vest is worn in combat areas, an 18-53% decrease (threat dependant) in all fragmentation caused casualties is predicted.Not recommended but some armour is better than no armour: Youtube Link firing at PASGT VEST: youtube.com/watch?v=_8cQV51ZK8APrice: 50 bucks each.Condition: Normal wear in color as seen in the pictures.
