Its 100% removable, and there are no other modifications done to the firearm in anyway. Reason for selling is the factory glock recoil spring is a bit too heavy for me to comfortably operate, and I don't want to mess around with aftermarket stuff.

Practically brand new, no box or papers just the derringer.Burgo was a line of firearms produce in West Germany during the 1950's and 60's. They were generally banned from importation after the passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968, which imposed a set of standards required to import firearms into the US. One of these standards mandated a minimum size in order to reduce the number of easily concealable handguns being brought in. It was brought before the Gun Control Act of 1968, this is why the importer's barrel stamp is missing, increasing the value. No barrel stamp on this Burgo.The gun is in 100% excellent condition with the exception of a developing crack on one of the grips. It can be seen in one of the pictures I’ve taken.I carried the Burgo in my boot when I rode my motorcycle…. For some strange reason the Wolverine leather boots I wore had a small little sewn-in pocket on the right boot….

Pmag.  This is a new unfired rifle that I never got around to doing anything with because of other projects.  I chose this particular AR-10 because I wanted a bit more range than a 16"" barrel would give and the medium contour barrel keeps the rifle as light as possible without compromising accuracy.  After looking over lots of ballistic data I saw no reason to go with a 20"" barrel, IMO the gain in velocity was simply not worth the extra length and weight.  Again, the rifle is new but it was purchased around three years ago, the only one I could find currently listed was one on Gunbroker for $1,650 in the same stock configuration.  I do have aftermarket pistol grips and stocks I can add for a little extra, just let me know.
$1,300 firm in cash or better in trade, not going to straight trade on something I can buy for hundreds less, sorry.  This one cost well over $1,500 after tax and it's still new.  
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and shorter in 9mm and .45 ACP(5""-6"") and cash or??  If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.  If you don't mention cash or other either way, I will assume you want a straight trade.  
Must be able to own a firearm in TX.  I can ship insured to another TX resident for $30 more.
Thanks for looking!"

Details  Holding true to the original's sub-MOA accuracy, right out-of-the box, the second generation SIG716 DMR features an improved gas system, lightweight handguard, and an overall weight reduction of more than two pounds. The two-stage match trigger and muzzle brake help shrink groups to less than a single minute-of-angle, accuracy simply thought impossible from a gas piston. This two-position adjustable gas system keeps carbon, excessive heat and other fouling out of the chamber, enhancing reliability and accuracy. Chambered in 7.62 x 51mm, the SIG716 DMR G2 works well with any model silencer or muzzle device.      Built for Harsh Tactical Environments Combining the reliability and ergonomics of the SIG516™ series rifle with the more powerful 7.62mm cartridge, the SIG716 features a short-stroke pushrod gas system. This advanced operating system reduces carbon fouling, excessive heat and unburned powder in the action, ensuring reliability and function that is unmatched.     Adjustable Gas Valve All SIG716 rifles have an adjustable gas valve that can be opened to increase gas flow when ammunition or adverse environmental conditions require additional cycling energy. Gas flow can also be reduced or shut-off for use with suppressors. All barrels are threaded 5/8×24 TPI to accept most popular flash suppressor and sound suppressor mounts, and come with an A2-style flash hider installed.      Highly Adaptable The SIG716 G2 comes standard with 6-position stock and polymer grip for the ultimate in ergonomic adaptability. A free-floating, aluminum, KeyMod handguard with full-length integrated top rail provides quick mounting for optics and accessories. Additionally, the ambidextrous controls round out the ergonomic features.Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.Buy this gun online at www.copsgunshop.net."

During the course of my rehab it has become evident that these affected areas will not allow me to compete safely in any USPSA matches.So I made the decision to sell all items I have for my two open guns, range bag, magazines, Ghost holster, CR Speed belt, mag pouches, magnetic mag button and associated paraphernalia.Both of these guns were made new for me by Shay at Akai Custom Guns. As you can see by the serial numbers we ordered the frames at the same time and both guns were completed within a month of each other. One match gun and one backup gun. The match gun, by its designation, was only used at matches while the backup gun was my practice gun.To make this even a better deal Shay I took both guns back, completely went through both guns repairing or replacing any parts that he deem necessary. Both guns were then sent out and refinished to the dark gray. So I’m selling to guns used but in brand-new condition.Both guns are chambered and 38 super, have STI frames and slides, infinity barrels and aluminum C-More Red Dot sights. These guns are perfect in every way… Nothing is wrong with them they are 100% operational.If you wish to buy the magazines with the guns I was set of six match magazines which are only used during the match so that have minimal ground time and four practice magazines which have a little bit more ground time. All the magazines are tune for both guns and work in both guns.Terms of sale: Cash only with FFL transfer.

This one has ALL the updates done and shows a date of 2/5/17.  There is one upgrade on it and that is a SilencerCo QD muzzle brake (gunsmith installed) for an omega can or shaker can.  It's better than the three prong flash hider that sig puts on.  This is an unfired rifle.  Unlike every other firearm on the market, the SIG MCX was built for optimum performance with the 300BLK cartridge and a silencer. The outcome is a firearm with superior suppression capability and enhanced reliability with both supersonic and subsonic loads A two-position gas block makes the transition from subsonic to supersonic as fast as flipping the lever. Changing between 300BLK and 5.56 NATO is as simple as swapping barrels and magazines in a matter of minutes. Converting to 7.62x39mm simply requires barrel, magazine, as well as an additional bolt change. Each SIG MCX features an aluminum KeyMod handguard, AR-style lower controls and utilizes AR magazines. A revolutionary recoil system does not require a buffer tube, allowing for side-folding stocks. A picatinny top rail allows for the mounting of lights or optics. The aluminum forend allows for rail sections to be added where they are needed, permitting the attachment of accessories. The lower receiver offers familiar AR-style controls. Completely ambidextrous controls include the safety, magazine release and charging handle.Not interested in trades, thank you."

The old world design and effective engineering of the lever action rifle is one that hasn't lost its touch. Marlin released the 1895 SBL edition chambered in the formidable .45-70 Government cartridge fairly recently. The all weather finishing on the rifle as well as the optic ready rail that runs the length of the receiver make this an excellent specialized hunting rifle for virtually any big game animal. This particular firearm has only been fired a handful of times and includes a soft case.
