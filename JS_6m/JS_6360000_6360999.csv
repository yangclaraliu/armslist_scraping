The outcome is a firearm with superior suppression capability and enhanced reliability with both supersonic and subsonic loads A two-position gas block makes the transition from subsonic to supersonic as fast as flipping the lever. Changing between 300BLK and 5.56 NATO is as simple as swapping barrels and magazines in a matter of minutes. Converting to 7.62x39mm simply requires barrel, magazine, as well as an additional bolt change. Each SIG MCX features an aluminum KeyMod handguard, AR-style lower controls and utilizes standard STANAG magazines. A revolutionary recoil system does not require a buffer tube, allowing for side-folding stocks. A picatinny top rail allows for the mounting of lights or optics. Removable SIG SAUER iron sights come standard. The aluminum forend allows for rail sections to be added where they are needed, permitting the attachment of accessories. The lower receiver offers familiar AR-style controls. Completely ambidextrous controls include the safety, magazine release and charging handle.         The First True Mission-Adaptable Weapon System Engineered from the ground up to be short, light, and silenced, the SIG MCX features an innovative two position, short-stroke gas piston operating system. And users can change barrels, calibers, stocks, and handguards in the field.

I also have an original manual with everything in it from basic functions to how to destroy it incase of enemy capture. I have the original green carry bag and the original case they used to carry it in planes that kept it pressurized. A few extra gadgets i have are some night vision beacons that attach to a D battery and can only be seen by night vision, and some headwear mounts. The beacons are great because u can put them on dogs if u hog hunt or you can set them out as markers to tell distances. Or youcan put them on buddies so u can all see eachother. The night vision alone sells for $3500 brand new so i value it at $2500+. The magnifiers and extras add another 1500-2000. So i am open to offers. Everything youre getting here is interested  great shape and is original.

Smith and Wesson Model 59 9mm, the first ever Smith double stack 14 round automatic made from 1971 to 1981 and this one is nickle plate and very very good condition with no discoloration or peeling of the plating, no corrosion. Only very light surface handling marks and no scratches, grips are near perfect and shiny screws, bore is bright and average internal wear from a 37 year old gun. Comes with one original 14 rd. mag and a second with the thicker base plate plus a hard case, not the original. Extra mags are easy to find and cheap. I fired one mag through it for a function test and it shot great but haven't had a chance to set up targets and probably won't. The very first runs of these in the early years of production saw some issues with feeding different ammos and jamming, this is one of the last runs, serial in the A 6XX,XXX numbers made around 1980 or 1981 so doubtful it would ever have any of those problems. This gun is still highly collectable and in this condition getting harder to find. Wish I could keep it but family health issues, so it has to go. Price is 600 obo or a trade of equal value."

When it comes time to defend your legacy, turn to the SAINT. It’s the ultimate refinement of the time-tested AR-15 design and represents everything that a defensive carbine should be. The quality of a rifle begins with its foundation. That’s why the extra-tough Type III aircraft-grade 7075 T6 aluminum upper and lower receivers are joined using the Accu-Tite system. Unlike lesser rifles, the SAINT is rock solid, with no accuracy-killing rattle or shake. On the outside, a hard-anodizing treatment protects your SAINT from both corrosion and the dings and blemishes that accompany hard use. Inside the upper receiver is an M16 bolt carrier group machined from Carpenter 158 steel. It’s shot peened and magnetic particle inspected for long-term durability. The SAINT features a 16-inch Chrome Moly Vanadium barrel treated with Melonite. Because details matter, you’ll even find that hidden areas like under the front sight base are finished with painstaking care and detail. The 1:8-inch twist rate provides the user with complete ammunition flexibility – the SAINT will handle heavy 80-grain and ultra-light projectiles with equal aplomb. While receiver fit and barrel construction represent the foundation of accurate performance, the trigger is the final interface between the shooter and rifle. The SAINT features micro-polished trigger components treated with Nickel Boron. The result is the feel of a competition trigger with the appropriate mil-spec pull weight for a defensive rifle. The SAINT is easy to shoot to its full performance potential. Speaking of performance, the SAINT is designed for smooth operation and fast but controlled follow-up shots. The mid-length gas system paired with a heavier carbine “H” heavy Tungsten buffer slows and smooths out the recoil cycle, creating a shooting experience second to none. Unlike most AR-type rifles that leave the factory with standard mil-spec furniture, the SAINT includes meaningful upgrades across the board. The Bravo Company Mod 0 Pistol Grip offers a more vertical orientation designed to support a natural hold when shooting from the modern combat stance. The grip is complemented by a Bravo oversized trigger guard designed for easy reach, with or without gloves. The Bravo Company buttstock offers positive cheek weld areas, a rubber butt plate for traction, and both QD and fixed sling attachment points. Like the Accu-Tite receiver, it’s designed for tight, rattle-free operation in any of its six positions. The all new and exclusive Bravo PKMT two-piece handguard covers aluminum heat shields but offers a super-slim profile. KeyMod attachment points allow placement of accessories according to your personal preference. In short, you’ll feel the difference. A defensive rifle must also be reliable, and that’s why the SAINT uses a dry lubricant coating inside the bolt carrier group and receiver extension tube that keeps it performing in the worst of conditions. The SAINT is optics-ready out of the box. The flat-top receiver is topped with Springfield Armory® low profile flip-up dual aperture rear sight with ½ minute of angle windage adjustment capability. Up front, the A2-style gas block and front sight features a standard post adjustable for elevation. The bottom line? When it’s time to protect and defend, trust the SAINT.

I cannot realize the greatness of this setup due to my lack of skill.Johnny Glock has created a trigger system that is fully adjustable for length of travel, takeup, overtravel, trigger weight, and on and on. This system is incredible in its adjustability and reliability. 
It includes everything that one would need to create the perfect competition-ready Glock trigger. Springs, drop-in trigger system, safety plunger, wrenches, and literature to help understand how it all works. For those who do not shoot competitively, this trigger system can be adjusted for a carry-friendly trigger setup, target shooting, or really anything in between. It is fully customizable from a crisp break with no overtravel to a rolling break to an extremely light hair trigger. 
If you are serious about marksmanship with your Glock, or just appreciate a tuneable system, you need this trigger!"
