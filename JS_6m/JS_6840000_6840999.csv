More pictures upon request. This pistol is in good condition and has a very low round count, especially considering its age. I currently have custom hand-made wood grips on it, but will include the original S&W grips as well. It will also come with two original magazines, which are rare and hard to find these days, and can be quite pricey. You won't see one of these available very often at all. Being that these old generation Smiths are only increasing in value, and the fact that original magazines are rare and hard to find (for a reasonable price) these days, I will place the trade value of this item at around $500 or so. Would be willing to sell for $450 cash. I am open to all reasonable trades so feel free to let me know what you have. Private message me here or text me at (five zero 4) 756-8421.

That is the Nighthawk Guarantee.**One Gun, One Gunsmith. At Nighthawk, each pistol is built from start to finish by a single gunsmith. Our slogan and philosophy, “One Gun, One Gunsmith,” is the direct result of how we build our guns. Once a pistol is built, the builder test fires the pistol to insure that it exceeds both The Nighthawk Standard, and his own. He then uses a metal stamp to imprint his initials under the left grip panel. While this is not the fastest, most efficient, or most cost-effective way to build a firearm, this shows the highest level of ownership, and it signifies the pride and commitment our gunsmiths take in the work they do. In addition to having the most talented gunsmiths in the industry building each gun by hand, Nighthawk also uses the highest quality parts and components to build each gun. All parts used in the pistols are fully machined from bar stock steel. This is the FM, Fully Machined Series of parts. Each part used is oversized and must be fit to each gun by hand - there are no drop-in, cast, or MIM parts used in the work we do. When the highest quality parts are combined with the most talented gunsmiths in the industry, through the process of One Gun, One Gunsmith, the resulting quality is unparalleled. It is our privilege to work with numerous talented, hardworking, passionate individuals. Our customers, vendors, and the loyal Nighthawk team, are more than just friends; we’re family."

Probably why neither has been carried more than a few times. I'm a Glock guy, I try other stuff but always revert back to by Glock(s). So long story lomg, it time for these to go to someone that will use them instead of letting them collect dust! If you're not aware, the P30 mags also run in the P2000SK. Partly why I picked them both up. I am open to optic trades(Trijicon, Vortex, Leupold mid to long range options for my SCAR17). Also, a few firearm trades like a Glock 26 FDE Gen 3 or 4... As I let a buddy have my G26 NIBx and regretted it soon after. PM any offers cash or otherwiseCash or trade value for either of these is 600. Have extra P30 mags that can be included with either one to even up a trade or for additional cash. As I will accept cash as well to even up a deal. I'll only trade for firearms that are ""like new condition"".Thinking about listing my Ruger Alaskan 2.5"" 454Casull with 500+rds of JHP's and around 250rds of 45LC as a package for sale or trade. So if that sparks anybody's interest feel free to inquire via email. It'll all go as a package or I'll keep it. Don't want to be in the ammo selling business. Thanks for looking guys.Trades:ACOG TA11H-308Glock 26 FDEFN 5.7 FDEOpen to the possibility of other Glock trades in 9mm and 45acpWorse I can say is ""I already have one"" or ""no thanks"". But you might get """"I wouldn't mind having 2nd or 3rd one"""

I am not interested in stock M1As, and given how shitty of a company Springfield is, I shouldn't even consider it but familarity of weapon systems is what I am going for now. So, if you have a SAGE'ed M1A you may consider getting rid of let me know. Please know the real market value of the weapons and associated equpment and how they depreciate, I have cash in hand but I am also not going to get ripped off."

Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face.

Product Description The VP Series is Heckler & Koch's first striker-fired HK since the P7 series pistols introduced in the 1980s. It is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. The VP Series integrates a striker firing system with an enhanced, HK ""light pull"" trigger. HK's cold hammer-forged barrel made from cannon grade steel ensures long service life, as does the polygonal bore profile which also provides a slight increase in muzzle velocity. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame, and the paddle-style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A unique VP feature is HK's patented rear-mounted charging supports on each side of the slide provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK's hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP SK subcompact models feature a more concealable design with a shorter barrel, abbreviated Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail, and a compact grip frame which retains the adjustable VP grip feature of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels. SK models can also use a variety of HK magazines - compact double stack 10- and 13-round with flat or extended floorplates, in addition to proven HK P30 steel magazines. This model comes equipped with night sights and includes one flat base and two extended floorplate 10-round magazines.

Its flat ground blade features a core of VG-10 stainless steel flanked on each side by layered Damascus.

This Spyderco Delica 4 knife has a titanium handle and a full, flat-ground VG-10 Damascus blade with a plain cutting edge.
The Spyderco original thumb hole on the blade allows ambidextrous one-hand opening, and the phosphor bronze washers at the pivot make the blade action smooth. The handle features screw construction for quick, simple cleaning and adjustment. The pocket clip is 4-way reversible for tip-up/down and left/right carry.
The Delica is a smaller version of the Spyderco Endura knife."

A 1987 manufactured Remington 870 Magnum 2 3/4” and 3” 12 ga. Pump shotgun with 18” barrel and extension tube capacity.These were made for the ride along security for the Highway Patrolman and Police units. Mostly held in their upright holder in the cruiser, and like this one, it was seldom used.This gun is in very good to excellent condition for a 30 year old Police Magnum Shotgun.For home protection, nothing is more of a deterrent to a home invader, than a Remington 870 Magnum 12 ga. shotgun. With '00' buck being chambered in the gun, it is the ultimate man stopper. It is without a doubt, the best home defense weapon, that you can buy for you and your wife. An un-chambered pump 12 ga. shotgun is much safer to have in a home for self protection, than a pistol or rifle.These 1987 manufactured Remington 870 Police Magnum Pump shotguns, were made with much better materials than the 870's of today. If you value the safety of yourself and your family, don't ever trust any cheap foreign made 12ga. for your home protection."

That is the Nighthawk Guarantee.**One Gun, One Gunsmith. At Nighthawk, each pistol is built from start to finish by a single gunsmith. Our slogan and philosophy, “One Gun, One Gunsmith,” is the direct result of how we build our guns. Once a pistol is built, the builder test fires the pistol to insure that it exceeds both The Nighthawk Standard, and his own. He then uses a metal stamp to imprint his initials under the left grip panel. While this is not the fastest, most efficient, or most cost-effective way to build a firearm, this shows the highest level of ownership, and it signifies the pride and commitment our gunsmiths take in the work they do. In addition to having the most talented gunsmiths in the industry building each gun by hand, Nighthawk also uses the highest quality parts and components to build each gun. All parts used in the pistols are fully machined from bar stock steel. This is the FM, Fully Machined Series of parts. Each part used is oversized and must be fit to each gun by hand - there are no drop-in, cast, or MIM parts used in the work we do. When the highest quality parts are combined with the most talented gunsmiths in the industry, through the process of One Gun, One Gunsmith, the resulting quality is unparalleled. It is our privilege to work with numerous talented, hardworking, passionate individuals. Our customers, vendors, and the loyal Nighthawk team, are more than just friends; we’re family.G-I-3312"

That is the Nighthawk Guarantee.**One Gun, One Gunsmith. At Nighthawk, each pistol is built from start to finish by a single gunsmith. Our slogan and philosophy, “One Gun, One Gunsmith,” is the direct result of how we build our guns. Once a pistol is built, the builder test fires the pistol to insure that it exceeds both The Nighthawk Standard, and his own. He then uses a metal stamp to imprint his initials under the left grip panel. While this is not the fastest, most efficient, or most cost-effective way to build a firearm, this shows the highest level of ownership, and it signifies the pride and commitment our gunsmiths take in the work they do. In addition to having the most talented gunsmiths in the industry building each gun by hand, Nighthawk also uses the highest quality parts and components to build each gun. All parts used in the pistols are fully machined from bar stock steel. This is the FM, Fully Machined Series of parts. Each part used is oversized and must be fit to each gun by hand - there are no drop-in, cast, or MIM parts used in the work we do. When the highest quality parts are combined with the most talented gunsmiths in the industry, through the process of One Gun, One Gunsmith, the resulting quality is unparalleled. It is our privilege to work with numerous talented, hardworking, passionate individuals. Our customers, vendors, and the loyal Nighthawk team, are more than just friends; we’re family."

This firearm is designed to handle high pressure loads under SAAMI specifications.Taurus Security System (TSS)rsTaurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.Transfer BarThe transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.Fiber Optic SightLight gathering tubes are inserted into the sight to offer the shooter the highly visible dot created by the end of the fiber optic"

It is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. The VP Series integrates a striker firing system with an enhanced, HK ""light pull"" trigger. HK's cold hammer-forged barrel made from cannon grade steel ensures long service life, as does the polygonal bore profile which also provides a slight increase in muzzle velocity. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame, and the paddle-style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A unique VP feature is HK's patented rear-mounted charging supports on each side of the slide provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK's hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP SK subcompact models feature a more concealable design with a shorter barrel, abbreviated Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail, and a compact grip frame which retains the adjustable VP grip feature of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels. SK models can also use a variety of HK magazines - compact double stack 10- and 13-round with flat or extended floorplates, in addition to proven HK P30 steel magazines. This model comes equipped with night sights and includes one flat base and two extended floorplate 10-round magazines.

When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.Transfer BarThe transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.Fiber Optic SightLight gathering tubes are inserted into the sight to offer the shooter the highly visible dot created by the end of the fiber optic    Caliber: 45 Colt/410-ga (2.5"" chamber)     Grips: Ribber"
