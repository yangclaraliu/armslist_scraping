Also, very very sturdy spring held/activated bi-podsFor the lower assembly it has PSA Lower with the PSA lower build kit installed for the trigger system. Also has FDE Colored Mag-pul handle, trigger guard, and adjustable stock that has the lock to make it very sturdy and not rattle at all. This gun comes with an additional TruGlo red dot scope, a 30 rnd FDE colored mag, a 20 rnd black mag, and also a 10 rnd black mag. Also I have a Mag-pul MS1 single point sling system that clips into the handrail that will come with it as well. I have spent over $2200 on the parts you see on this gun but I am willing to work with price a little bit. I've fired over 800rnds through it and it is a very sturdy sharp shooting gun and very good for coyote hunting even when they are moving as it has hardly and recoil at all due to the muzzle break. I recently took the scope off to mount the 45 degree angle iron sights so it will need to be sighted in again. If you'd like more pictures email or text me at REDACTED"

The laptop is about 3 years old but it still works great. I have recently gotten a smaller laptop and do not need this one anymore. At the peak of me playing on it, I could run games like Saints Row 4, Dead Island, And Grand Theft Auto at full performance and it ran beautifully. I am looking to trade for just about any gun; handguns, shotguns, rifles. I bought the computer new for about $1200, but I would like to get a trade value of at least $400. I am interested in .22, 9mm (concealed carry size), 12gauge, .223, basically anything, just let me know! The only problems with the laptop is that it is running somewhat slow right now, but I am going to factory reset it to clear off all the programs. Also the battery dies somewhat quickly, I would say you have a solid two hours before it needs to be plugged in. A replacement battery for it is not too expensive, its really best to be sat at a desk and plugged in though, not really meant to be taken everywhere due to its size. I will link a page describing its specs and will send pictures on request. Specs: http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/laptops/52825/msi-ge60-review"

Profile: ultra slim compact carry
Super-compact 9mm pistol that easily fits into a pocket or waistband.
Striker-fired action. Trigger system is like a true double action/single action design. It is fired single action every time, and the double action is there as a backup, in the event that a cartridge fails to fire on the first pull of the trigger. In other words, the trigger system has double-strike capability. The slide does not have to cock the action before the trigger can be pulled again, allowing the shooter to try again if a dud cartridge does not fire on the first pull. Trigger pull is perfect for its size.
Multiple safeties: Manual safety allows the pistol to be carried cocked and locked by blocking the trigger and locking the slide. There is a trigger safety, so carrying with the thumb safety in the “off safe” position will work as well. There is also an internal firing pin block, that blocks the striker from reaching the primer of the chambered cartridge unless the trigger is in its rearward position.
3 dot sight system.   Rear sight is adjustable for both elevation and windage.
Grip well-textured for a positive hold and shaped for a comfortable feel.
Low-profile magazine release -- large enough for a quick reload, but is not so elevated above the surface of the frame that it might be unintentionally activated.
Barrel is 3.28” and provides excellent accuracy for such a small pistol."

I have brand new in stock Steel 46100 Target Tumblers that you could shoot at forever. They are $40 Each set! With each shot they would tumble around hence the name Tumblers. IN ADDITION! The new measurement armor for the 11""x14"" to fit for more protection in larger sized vests.

Not only does this help to protect against fragmentation it also reduces the impact. I have taken it out and tested it has proven itself to be very effective. Shot at it 20 yards with 9mm and .45 and at 50 yards with a 223/5.56 also with .308 rounds it had stopped the fragmentation.  The plate carriers are adjustable from Small up to XX-Large MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs. The measurement of the plates are 1/4"" also not to mention tested by the U.S Army test labs. This particular armor is made to military spec and it is designed to withstand higher caliber rounds. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-A-46100 plates at 30 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail as this is one of the best quality steel out there. I have personally shot at our Mil-A-46100 Armor multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc"

This could be a good business opportunity for you with a low cost of entry, while helping others to maintain their personal safety. Instructors typically recover their cost to certify with their first class or two however LEOSA Trainers, Inc. (LTI) also has created a scholarship program where an instructor candidate may earn 100% of their cost of certification by developing a list of people who they expect to train after certification. This puts their training to immediate use and builds their training business through referrals. We are happy to invest in people who will invest in themselves.This opportunity can be a great source of supplemental income which offer the flexibility to schedule classes as your schedule allows.Why LEOSA Trainers, Inc.? LEOSA Trainers, Inc. (LTI) specializes in permit or license to carry training and has created a high quality Florida state specific training curriculum. Our instructors have trained thousands of people and we understand why training to survive an attack must be much more than just the minimum training required by law to apply for a permit or license. LTI training begins with avoiding conflict, the morality of self defense, the legalities, the use of force, how to be properly insured if reasonable force (not just a firearm) is used to defend yourself, the human target, the mechanics of carrying a firearm, how to choose a handgun, firearms safety, defensive shooting, a shooting qualification and much more. Our goal is to teach our students how to survive an attack physically, morally, legally and financially. Surviving the aftermath of using a gun to save your life is very important and this comprehensive training is typically not available from other firearms instructors. LTI publishes the book Florida Guide For Armed Citizens which our students receive as a resource and a valuable part of their training. It would be very time consuming and expensive for you to create a similar comprehensive training curriculim on your own and obtain all the regulatory approvals. LTI has a Florida State Director as a resource for our Florida instructors to support you as questions and business issues come up (and they will). LTI is authorized to certify firearms instructors under Florida Statute Chapter 790 and is currently seeking instructor candidates to certify in Florida.The certification process is completed over a long weekend of training (dates and locations will be announced).  Please contact Gene German at REDACTED or by email to REDACTED to exchange information about yourself and to discuss your questions about this business opportunity so we can decide if we are a good match for each other. Veterans and active or retired law enforcement individuals are encouraged to consider this opportunity - and THANK YOU for your service! You may also visit www.ltiflorida.com for more information."

This one has the 6"" barrell and comes with one 9 round magazine.Since most folks are not familliar with (Arcadia Machine & Tool) AMT I have added a short bio of the company and the AMT AUTOMAG II.The First Successful Self-Loading PistolIn .22 WMR Is Still A Peach. Harry W. Sanford was one of those bigger-than-life entrepreneurs who strode into the firearms business, developed an incredible variety of advanced designs and then crash landed in an avoidable lawsuit. Sanford is best known for his massive, stainless steel, rotary bolt Auto Mags in .44 and .357 AMP calibers which grabbed the public’s attention while flashing across the big screen in Clint Eastwood’s 1983 thriller Sudden Impact. Less glamorous, but made in much larger quantities at a price point the average shooter could afford, were his familiar AMT produced Backup, Hardballer and Automag II, III, IV and V stainless steel handguns plus a myriad of other pistol and rifle designs under a variety of corporate monikers. Roger Renner, AMT’s former quality-control engineer, who now fashions sleek, underhammer big-game rifles was most helpful in giving me some insight into Sanford the man. Sanford was primarily an idea man, although he was totally at home in a machine shop. He would develop a concept for a new firearm and then hire engineers and machinists to flesh it out and build it. He had a passion for building original designs and was fascinated by the Kimball automatic pistol, chambered for the .30 M1 Carbine cartridge, which appeared on the market ever so briefly in the mid-1950’s. Renner observed Sanford was also a stubborn man and not prone to take advice from those working for him. A case in point was his insistence on using type 17-4 precipitation hardening stainless steel for the major components of his firearm designs. It is a high strength alloy, but when used for both the frame and the slide of a pistol, for example, the parts tend to stick to each other and gall easily. The solution recommended to him by the engineering staff was to change the alloy of either the frame or the slide and eliminate the problem. He would have none of it and insisted on using a mixture of lithium grease and oil to keep his Auto Mag’s popping. Similarly, Sanford was apparently averse to studying competitors’ products and their design solutions before charging off on a design of his own. The development of a new product was more or less a trial-by-error process at the AMT shop. The AMT Automag II .22 Magnum (above) is a hard-hitting handgun for varmints and small game.The profile II (below) is that of a slim, sleek, single-action hunting pistol. Nevertheless, Sanford’s designs are some of the most interesting ever developed. The Automag II is a case in point. As far as I know, the Automag II represents the first successful .22 Magnum pistol ever produced and marketed to the general public. What makes the design even more timely is currently High Standard has returned the Automag II and the .380 AMT Backup models to the marketplace. The Automag II features a retarded blowback action. Visually, it looks like a sleek stainless steel blend of an open framed Beretta and a 1911 Colt. It is sleek. The frame is only 0.79-inch wide while the width of the grip is 2 inches. It feels like a nice, slim M1911 in my hand. The Automag II was originally offered with three barrel lengths: 3-3/8, 4-1/2 and 6 inches. The model pictured here has a 6-inch barrel, weighs 32 ounces and has an overall length of 9-1/4 inches. Frankly, a .22 Magnum needs a 6-inch barrel to approach anywhere near its inherent potential as a hunting cartridge plus, even with a 6-inch barrel, the muzzle blast will pretty much awaken the dead. The fireball at the end of the muzzle will also light up the night sky. I can’t imagine touching off the .22 Maggie in a 3-3/8-inch barreled model Automag. Some of the interesting features of the original, single-action Automag II are a 9-shot, stainless steel magazine with a release at the heel of the grip, a fully adjustable 3-dot sight system by LPA of Italy, a hammer-blocking safety at your right thumb which is pushed “Up” to disengage, a squared-off triggerguard, a trigger measuring 5 pounds on my Lyman electronic scale (but feels lighter), a last shot hold open on the slide and a M1911-type slide stop. Anyone familiar with fieldstripping the M1911 will have no problem with the disassembly of the Automag II, and if you have any doubts, YouTube has some great videos of the whole procedure, in addition High Standard can supply you with an owner’s manual."

Its integral flat-top mount, offers out-of-the-box compatibility with Civilian A3 and M4 carbines, and it attaches directly to any 1913 Picatinny rail for use on a variety of other systems as well. The 3x25 tactical scope has a new .223/5.56 62 gr.  BDC Knob from 100 to 500 yds with 50 yds fine adjustment clicks; windage knob has 1/4 moa finger adjustments and provides precise corrections on small arms in most sizes and calibers, for various ranges. The illuminated center dot is extremely accurate for long range applications and the MIL lines under the center dot could be used by experienced shooters, as fast bullet drop compensating marks or for quick ranging. All of these features make this compact CQB-type tactical scope significantly superior to any red dot or EOtech type scopes, especially at long range, due to its higher magnification, uncomparable image quality, field of view, adjustable reticle image and reliability. This scope will function perfectly even with a dead battery. When the illumination is off, all the reticle lines appear in standard black and are razor sharp.

This is a high precision weapon system from Patriot Ordinance Firearms. I have fired a few hundred rounds through it and have always been impressed with its recoil handling, quick target re-acquisition and extrordinarily minimal maintenance requirements. It has never failed to fire or feed. With the regulated gas block gas piston system, the weapon only requires minimal cleaning and functions perfectly. This weapon is designed to require very little lubrication since the gas piston system does not allow exhaust gases back into the mechanism. This weapon comes with a factory lifetime warantee. High points of the weapon are as follows:
modular free floating rail
14.5in Fluted barrel with welded flash suppressor
Short-stroke gas piston system
5.56x45mm NATO (.233 remington)
NP3 coated internals
Magpul PRS adjustable cheek and butt pad stock
Magpul AFG front rail attachment
Magpul ""flip-up"" removable front post and 2 setting rear peep sights
NCstar Illuminated reticle/integrated laser 3-9x42 optics with quick-release mount
All items pictured are included in sale price. These include optics, 4 Magpul P-mag 30rd mags, 4 stock steel AR 30rd mags, stock 10rd steel mag, flip up front and rear magpul removable sights, several hundred rounds of 5.56 federal ammunition (started with 1000, have shot a few hundred and I honestly have no idea how much is left) and ammo can. Also included but not pictured are standard black plastic rifle case, brass catcher attachment and shoulder sling. MSRP on this weapon is currently at about 2,100$ Asking 2000$ for entire kit, price is firm."

Are you interested in becoming a Minnesota certified firearms instructor and running your own training business, either part time or full time? This could be a good business opportunity for you with a low cost of entry, while helping others to maintain their personal safety. Instructors typically recover their cost to certify with their first class or two however LEOSA Trainers, Inc. (LTI) also has created a scholarship program where an instructor candidate may earn 100% of their cost of certification by developing a list of people who they expect to train after certification. This puts their training to immediate use and builds their training business through referrals. We are happy to invest in people who will invest in themselves. This opportunity can be a great source of supplemental income which offer the flexibility to schedule classes as your schedule allows. Why LEOSA Trainers, Inc.?LEOSA Trainers, Inc. (LTI) specializes in permit to carry training and has created a high quality Minnesota state specific training curriculum. Our instructors have trained thousands of people and we understand why training to survive an attack must be much more than just the minimum training required by law to apply for a permit. LTI training begins with avoiding conflict, the morality of self defense, the legalities, the use of force, how to be properly insured if reasonable force (not just a firearm) is used to defend yourself, the human target, the mechanics of carrying a firearm, how to choose a handgun, firearms safety, defensive shooting, a shooting qualification and much more. Our goal is to teach our students how to survive an attack physically, morally, legally and financially. Surviving the aftermath of using a gun to save your life is very important and this comprehensive training is typically not available from other firearms instructors.  LTI publishes the book Minnesota Guide For Armed Citizens which our students receive as a resource and a valuable part of their training. It would be very time consuming and expensive for you to create a similar comprehensive training curriculum on your own and obtain all the regulatory approvals. LTI has resources for our Minnesota instructors to support you as questions and business issues come up (and they will).LTI is authorized to certify firearms instructors under Minnesota Statute 624.714 and is currently seeking instructor candidates to certify in Minnesota. The certification process is completed over a long weekend of training (dates and locations will be announced).Please contact Gene German at REDACTED or by email to REDACTED to exchange information about yourself and to discuss your questions about this business opportunity so we can decide if we are a good match for each other. Veterans and active or retired law enforcement individuals are encouraged to consider this opportunity - and THANK YOU for your service!You may also visit www.leosatrainers.com for more information."
