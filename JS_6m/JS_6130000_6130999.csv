I also have 5 mags to go with it as well. These go for $2000+ on gunbroker so low ballers will be ignored. I'm only considering trading as I don't really want another 9mm SBR.

This is a C&R firearm so does not need to go through FFL
But must meet in person
 
I acquired this recently in a trade and really don’t have the need for another one, although it is a very clean rifle.
 
The rifle is clean and cycles very smoothly, bore is in great shape, wood is in excellent shape, everything works correctly.
It is an FTR (Factory Thorough Repair by BSA), so the numbers don't all match, but it essentially met all factory new specs after the rebuild.
Wood is in very good condition throughout. Bore is clean and shiny, end to end. Bolt operates without a hitch as well as trigger.
Also includes an additional magazine, a spike bayonet and original style sling (possibly original but that I am not certain of)
 
I do have additional pictures that I can send to serious interested parties.
 
$400 obo
Possible trades of Firearms but that’s about it. (Not looking to add any cash on my end)
I would consider ½ cash and ½ trade, depending on trade offered

Here is the story behind this gun. I bought this in like new condition with only about 300 rounds through it. I decided that I wanted to turn it into an open gun. I sent the gun to Springer Precision to have all the following work done. Barsto barrel threaded and their minor comp fitted. 2.5# trigger, ejection port lowered, carver mount installed, Springer's slide racker, stippled grip, their mag well and extended magazine release button. I ended up switching to STI for my limited gun and wanted an open gun to match so I'm selling this gun. I figured the gun would be easier to sell closer to stock except for the mag well, extended magazine release button and trigger job. There are no sights currently installed on the gun but I have them to give with it. This sale will include everything I have including 5 mags and a bunch of wolf springs. The mags are limited to 10 rounds via mag blocks but can be cut out to return them to 19 capacity. Feel free to ask and questions. The gun is in excellent condition with the only blemish being small marks from the carver angle mount."

It has XS Big Dot tritium steel night sights, and will come with the original box, two 10 round mags, one 13 round G21 mag, a leather mag holster, and all paperwork.Price is as listed. This is a great deal for everything listed. Just compare to other listings for the same gun. I am easygoing but I will not entertain lowball offers.If you do not already know, this is the slim version of the Glock 30. Glock used an SF frame with a 36 slide to make an easily concealable .45 with plenty of capacity. I also have a new Streamlight TLR1 300 lumen light I could throw in for an extra 70.00. That would be like getting the gun and a 100.00 light for less than the cost of a new gun. These pistols sell in the gun store I work at for 545.00 all day long.I can meet somewhere close to the Concord Mills area and will need either a pistol permit from you, or to see your concealed carry card. No trades at this time, unless it is a Trijicon RMR. Thanks."

My late father, police officer, was quite the SIG enthusiast and had this nice piece for a short while before his passing, so it indeed saw light use and was well taken care of. It appears he sold the original grips and placed these black ones on. Over all a nice pistol, feels great, however I have no need for it and best to pass the money earned onto the rest of my family. I am providing one of my own cases too since my father didn't have one for it that I could find.

These rounds will certainly work on our local whitetale deer but there certainly isn't a need to use such a premium round on our smaller whitetales in this area.  These rounds would be ideal for someone planning to take an elk or mule deer hunt out west, especially for longer range shots.  They would probably be great for black bear or hogs here or great for some larger northern whitetales."

The modern-style recoil pad provides for not only a significant reduction in perceived recoil, but is snag-free as well. A long recoil spring is located in the butt of the stock, simplifying assembly and allowing it to cycle a wide variety of loads across the power spectrum in both 2 ¾” and 3”.In addition, the rearward spring design makes required cleanings less frequent and easier when they are needed. Removal of the installed magazine plug is simple, requiring only the magazine cap to be unscrewed. Without the plug it gives the upland hunter a 4+1 capacity. With superb balance and an average weight of 6.4 lbs, the 920 is well-suited to the pursuit of both birds and clays."

The multi-configurable M1 variant of the AUG A3 platform is the latest generation of the venerated bullpup platform. Utilizing an optics attachment platform similar to the rare and much-sought-after AUG A2, the AUG A3 M1 is available in a Short-Rail version, a High-Rail version as well as an Integrated-Optic version with either a 1.5X or 3X scope. The AUG A3 M1 Optics version has a more traditional AUG scope tube with exceptionally bright and clear optical elements, modernized with the addition of three Picatinny rail sections to accommodate accessories like a close-quarters holographic sight. With 16 numbered slots, the High-Rail version was designed to accommodate the widest range of optic choices, and the 11-slot Short-Rail version was designed for use with a reflex sight or a longer-eye relief optic. The rail and optics platforms on all three AUG A3 M1 versions are interchangeable via the three base screws that thread from the underside of the top of the receiver. The AUG A3 M1 boasts am overall length of just 28.15 inches, including its 16-inch heavy barrel, making it at least 8 inches shorter than an M4 carbine with a comparable-length barrel. The short-stroke gas-piston operation of the AUG runs exceptionally cleaner by nature because all of the operational exhaust gas vents out of the front of the rifle. The AUG’s matching, yet opposed, stainless steel operation and guide rods affixed to the bolt carrier glide effortlessly inside the receiver for unparalleled smoothness in operation as well as exceptional reliability. Dual gas-adjustment settings ensure its operation, even with the dirtiest ammunition and in adverse conditions. The AUG A3 M1 has all the classic features and benefits that established it as the pinnacle of modern rifle design, including expedited disassembly as well as simple conversion to left-hand operation, which requires replacement of the standard bolt with the optional left-eject bolt and swapping the ejection-port cover. It also features a quick-change barrel with a collapsible forward grip as well as a two-position cross-bolt safety that locks the trigger. The receiver was also updated to replace the permanently affixed front sling swivel with a VLTOR Quick-Disconnect Sling Swivel, which makes two-point sling attachment or removal extremely fast and easy, and users of single-point slings can remove the front sling swivel entirely, if they so desire. The AUG A3 M1 stock, cocking piece and forward grip are made of highly durable synthetic and are available in Black, Green, Mud and White colors. The rifle is available in either the standard version that accepts genuine Steyr AUG magazines or as a NATO version that accepts standard STANAG (AR) magazines.

Other than that they are identical. Included are both the factory original grips, and the extended magwell grips used on the Tacops. It would make a great addition to round out a Sig Sauer enthusiasts collection since the production for this line of P-226 was only a few years, or it would make a great shooter for someone that wants a Tacops without the beaver tail frame.
It has the more desirable, and reliable short extractor, nitron finish, featuring front cocking serrations, a Siglite rear night sights, a TruGLo Tritium Fiber Optic front night site. In daylight the Truglo is very bright and stands out very well for target shooting, in low light or darkness all three sites are good and bright.
