This is the absolute holy grail of semi auto AK's in the US. This is a factory test fired only, best I can tell from the zero carbon anywhere on this rifle, example. However, I am not the original owner so pics are below for you to make your own determination. It has a couple safe bumps/scuffs, but that's it. The finish still has that fantastic Valmet sparkle in it that most no longer have. The sister to this rifle currently resides in the NRA museum. Less than 50 total M76's in x39 were imported in 1988. This wood stock is the most comfortable if you do plan on ever firing it of the 3 styles imported. There were about 20 of the wood stock rifles brought in. It has the Fiskars bayonet and a lanyard loop mag included. This may be the only chance in your lifetime that you have the chance to own one of these.
Now that all that is outta the way, I'll cut to the meat and potatoes of the deal. I am looking for someone located within about 500 miles of Albuquerque. Reason is, I want to do this deal ftf at your FFL. I am really apprehensive about shipping something like this. I am asking $7500 for all of it. 1 sold in June for alot more money with no extras and it was clearly a shooter grade rifle."

They give it a limited lifetime warranty. Ok, on to all the bells and whistles. This is a 300 WM rifle, the best part of the rifle is the barrel, it is a custom proof research barrel that cost $1200 alone, gurantee to be 1/2 moa, although with the right ammo I have shot below 1/2 MOA!! I have shot it out to 1500 yards no problem! The chassis has a built in 20 moa, and the scope mount has a 40 moa, so this was built for shooting extreme distances. It has almost no recoil because of the Alamo 4 star custom made muzzle brake, don't let your friends be to the side of the brake haha, its loud! The scope is sighted in for a 1000 yards.

The bore of the barrel is nice and smooth. The bluing is mostly gone on the front of the barrels, there was some surface rust we took off with CLP and a nylon brush. The receiver has some light scratching and scuffing, but the engraving is all still very visible and clear.

Included will also be SKB choke tool, Hi-Viz sight guide and extra color tubes, Graco Comb guide, plastic comb washers, SKB cleaning cloth and SKB tag. See photos for details. Additional photos can be seen at: http://s102.photobucket.com/user/westlandstore07/library/skb%2012Shipping will be FREE on this shotgun to anywhere in the continental U.S. Receiver The 85TSS receiver is produced in two sizes; a standard frame for twelve gauge models, and smaller frame for all 20, 28, and .410 gauge models.  The receiver is cut from a forged steel ingot by computerized CNC machines to precise dimensions measured in thousandths of an inch.  The final result is a low profile box lock receiver with a modified “Greener” style crossbolt locking mechanism inletted at the top of the receiver.  The strength of this design ensures that your SKB is capable of & providing a lifetime of shooting enjoyment.  The receiver is hand polished and enhanced with a rolled arabesque engraving pattern.  It is then protected by a silver nitride finish applied in super heated conditions that provides a corrosion resistant surface.   Monobloc The monobloc is also cut from a forged steel ingot by computerized CNC machines to similar precise dimensions.  The monobloc contains 2 locking lugs which engage the crossbolt, 2 integral shoulder lugs and a base lug which interlocks with the receiver as the action is closed.  This combination forms one of the strongest actions on the market.  The barrel tubes are seated and soldered into the monoblock to ensure the correct point of impact of both the top and bottom barrel.  Each side of the monoblock is precisely cut for a single piece ejector and the pivot seat.  The finished barrel group rotates at the pivot seat on two trunnions mounted through the sides of the receiver.  After years of use, the SKB action can be easily re-tightened if need be, ensuring that your shotgun maintains a tight fit for many more years of service.   Trigger Group The non-detachable trigger system of the 85TSS has been improved with a design refinement to reduce engagement creep and over-travel.  This new tournament trigger allows the sear to disengage and drop with less pull weight.  The shooter feels a smooth and crisp trigger pull.  The hammers are powered by  “modified V” shaped springs that provide faster lock times than conventional coil springs.  The firing order of the barrels is determined by the position of the barrel selector.  The selector is located in the trigger blade keeping its operation separate from the tang mounted manual safety.The SKB 12 gauge .735 backbored barrels are produced using a hammer forging process which ensures trueness over the length of the barrel and a consistent wall diameter.  Fabricated from a high strength chromium alloy steel, SKB barrels are highly polished to a near mirror surface.  They are then chrome lined from the chamber to the muzzle.  This protective surface reduces the corrosive effects of moisture produced by plastic shotshells and other environmental conditions.  This process ensures that your SKB barrels will provide years of service."

Since its original introduction in 2008, the LCP has set the industry standard for compact, reliable .380 Auto pistols. Rather than rest on that accomplishment, Ruger has built upon that solid performance to produce the new, best-in-class LCP II pistol. The LCP II features a short, crisp, single-action trigger with inner trigger safety, improved sights for superior visibility, a larger grip surface for better distribution of recoil forces and an easy-to-rack slide with an improved slide stop mechanism with a last round hold-open. With its compact size (just 5.17"" long and 3.71"" tall), this new lightweight compact pistol comes with a pocket holster and is designed to fit a variety of holsters and concealed carry options. Weighing in at just 10.6 ounces and equipped to hold 6+1 rounds of powerful .380 Auto ammunition, the LCP II is the ideal back-up gun - compact and light enough that you never have to leave it at home. The American-made LCP II is built on a rigid, one-piece, precision-machined, anodized aluminum chassis with integral frame rails and fire control housing. Additional features include rugged construction with a through-hardened alloy steel slide; a black, one-piece, high-performance, glass-filled nylon grip frame; a textured grip frame to provide a secure and comfortable grip; a finger grip extension floorplate that can be added to the magazine for comfort and more secure grip, and a blued, alloy steel barrel. The LCP II ships with one 6-round magazine. Note: Six-round LCP® magazines are compatible with the LCP® II, but will not activate the last round hold-open feature of the LCP® II. Seven-round LCP® magazines are NOT compatible with the LCP® II. Firearm Features  Short, crisp, single-action trigger pull.

The Beretta 92FS is the world's most trusted military and police pistol. To quote the manufacturer, ""The 92FS is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match. Period."" I absolutely love this gun, but money is tight."

The scope mount is on the side rail and it's high enough to use either the scope or the iron sights without moving or modifying anything.  The scope is also brand new, it's a UTG and the reticle lights up red or green.   I'm also throwing in another receiver cover with scope rail and a muzzle brake/flash suppressor.   $650 firm for everything.  For $550 i'll sell the rifle as it came from the factory which is just the rifle with the wood stock and 1 ten round mag.  NO SCAMMERS!   It's just irritating and a waste of time for us both.  I don't want your fake bank check!    Call, text or email me if interested.  Rich REDACTED"

The short-stroke gas-piston operation of the AUG runs exceptionally cleaner by nature because all of the operational exhaust gas vents out of the front of the rifle. The AUG’s matching, yet opposed, stainless steel operation and guide rods affixed to the bolt carrier glide effortlessly inside the receiver for unparalleled smoothness in operation as well as exceptional reliability. Dual gas-adjustment settings ensure its operation, even with the dirtiest ammunition and in adverse conditions.Stop by our store or give us a call for more information!You must be legally allowed to own this rifle and are responsible for knowing your own local laws and regulations.  We will ship this rifle anywhere in the ConUSA for $35.  Thanks for looking!"

Originally designed as a means for persons with limited mobility to operate and fire the AR-15 pistol, the custom adaptation of the Stabilizing Brace to the Galil ACE pistol takes the application of large frame pistol control and stabilization to a new level. With the IWI brace’s unique sidefolding feature, the Galil ACE SB can be fired with or without the brace extended depending on the shooters need. With the brace in the folded position, storage space required in your safe or range/rifle bag is minimized.In all other respects, the Galil ACE GAP39SB is identical to the GAP39.   The modernized Galil ACE is based upon the reliable mechanism of the original Galil assault rifle first developed by IMI in the late 1960’s. Drawing inspiration from the legendary Russian AK-47 and the Finnish Valmet RK 62, the IWI Galil ACE has been continuously improved over the last 40+ years, resulting in today’s extremely reliable and highly accurate Galil ACE.     Improvements made since the original Galil was first developed include:  Charging handle (reciprocating) moved to the left side of the milled steel receiver allowing for weak hand operation Weight reduction with the use of modern polymers AKM/AK-47 magazine compatibility Full length 2-piece Picatinny top rail Picatinny tri-rail forearm with built in, slide on/ off rail covers with pressure switch access Fully adjustable iron sights with Tritium front post  Stop by our store or give us a call for more information!You must be legally allowed to own this rifle and are responsible for knowing your own local laws and regulations.  We will ship this rifle anywhere in the ConUSA for $35.  Thanks for looking!"

Nobody seems to know exactly how many of these were manufactured, but there hasn't been one for sale in many years.

The Omni Hybrid lower features a patented hammer and trigger pin retainment system which increases stability and accuracy by preventing movement from the hammer and trigger pin during firing.This AR-15 lower receiver also features a patented over-molded metal insert, which reinforces the buffer tube housing and rear takedown pin, allowing for metal-on-metal contact with both the buffer tube as well as the rear takedown pin. This decreases the impact from recoil for more consistent firing.    Just 8 ounces overall   Built from a fiberglass-composite polymer over a zinc metal insert, with extra reinforcements in high-pressure sections   Multi-caliber: can be built as a 5.56 NATO, 300 BLK, or any of the popular AR conversions   Inter-lock hammer and trigger pin retainment system built into the Lower prevents movement from the hammer and trigger pin during firing   Beveled magwell for fast changes   Winter trigger guard for use while wearing gloves   Works with standard LPK"
