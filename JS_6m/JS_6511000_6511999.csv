I bought it and put it away when all the gun scare and election rhetoric started in , and have never taken to shoot . I will take a small loss , it is black in color and bad to the bone . Probably the best deal out their . I'll take $700, I paid more than that as you can guess ,plus taxes & paperwork and the shells I ordered . My gun friends say I'm crazy for taking a loss on a new gun but it's not getting any use locked away plus someone could probably use a great home defense gun right now . First serious buyer gets it , I probably have a red dot optic I'll put on it to get you shooting if your buying . Great deal for someone without all the searching and driving or ordering. My loss is your gain , don't hesitate shoot me an email if you been wanting one of these fantastic shotguns. I'll sign a receipt so you know it's a legal gun from a legal seller .

This is a submachine gun fashioned to fire from the closed bolt position and fitted so that the folding stock is welded to the top. With proper paper work and a little effort, this could make an awesome SBR project.As you can see the weapon is in excellent cosmetic condition. It also functions flawlessly, eating up any and all ammunition I put through it. This is a really fun gun and its heft makes recoil very light and hardly noticable. The bore is brite and excellent as well.The price for this PPS-43C is $625. That gets you 3 33 round magazines and the attached sling as well. I have more magazines that I will sell for $25 a piece. This is a relatively fair price considering the condition of the weapon and the fact that these are getting harder and harder to find. Price is firm but as always negotiation will be entertained! Trades for this one will include (but not be limited to) Walther P-1, Lee-Enfield rifles (No1, No4, No5), or anything else interesting that you may have.
