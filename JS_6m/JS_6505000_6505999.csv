The rear sight body is Wire-EDM machined from 4140 Chrome Moly Steel that is then heat treated to a hardness of RC 38-40, ensuring tight part-to-part fit and long-lasting durability. Click-adjustments are positive and precise, allowing for reliable and consistent point of impact changes. This Kimber Rear Night Sight incorporates a 45 Degree Beveled Blade that is Partially Serrated for reduced glare, and positions a Trijicon self-luminous Green Tritium Dot on either side of the rear sight notch for easier acquisition in low light conditions. The Beveled Blade profile is a good choice for use on a competition pistol since it presents a less obstructed view of the target as compared to a traditional square target blade, and it can help quicken one's draw time by minimizing the potential for snagging on gear or clothing.

This Front Night Sight comes equipped with a 0.115"" Wide Blade and a Contoured Base that blends in nicely with most round-top or ""carry melted"" slide profiles, resulting in a clean looking installation that requires little (if any) filing to accomplish.

Please view manufacturer info below. EXTREMELY LIMITED AVAILABILITY! Czech Small Arms manufactured rifles with wood impregnated plastic furniture! The Sa vz.58 in 7.62×39 is manufactured by Czech Small Arms (formerly known as D-Technik) in Jablunka, Czech Republic and includes the following: – chrome lined 16.15 inch barrel with removable muzzle nut – high quality barrel manufactured by Lothar Walther in Germany – patented push-down plate on bolt carrier to prevent misfire issues (Czech Small Arms/D-Technik vz. 58 firearms are the only vz. 58s manufactured with this vital part to ensure reliability) – hand picked original wood impregnated plastic furniture – drilled and tapped side rail holes in receiver for do-it-yourself side rail installation for optic mounts – semi gloss/matte black finish cured at 300 °F over phosphate – two 30 round magazines – owner’s manual – cleaning kit (does not include oil can) – sling – 5 year warranty Information on wood impregnated plastic furniture CzechPoint was able to locate an extremely small quantity of nice condition wood impregnated plastic furniture in the Czech Republic for better matching furniture sets. This original wood impregnated plastic furniture was manufactured over many years in different hues, textures, wood fiber patterns, and gloss versus non-gloss. It is extremely difficult to provide a perfectly matching furniture set. This is why CzechPoint has not sold wood impregnated plastic furniture on Czech Small Arms manufactured rifles. If you are looking for a vz. 58 with the original wood impregnated plastic furniture, don’t miss out on this opportunity as inventory is exrtremely limited and it is ‘first come, first served.’ As found throughout the Czech Small Arms (CSA) line of vz.58 rifles and pistols, the vz.58 Military 762 possess the patented ‘push-down’ plate on the bolt carrier. The patented ‘push-down’ plate ensures the user will not experience possible misfire problems that can be found with other manufacturer vz.58 type firearms. The five USA made parts used on the vz. 58 Military 762 model rifle are: muzzle nut, disconnector, trigger (glass-filled nylon), magazine follower, and magazine floor plate. The color of the finish is a semi gloss/matte black coating (cured at 300°F). The coating has been applied over a phosphate finish to maximize finish durability. The new production rifle barrels are manufactured by Lothar Walther in Germany and made from a high alloy Chrome Molybdenum steel (4340) and is chrome-lined. The muzzle nut is removable and the thread pattern is 14×1 right hand (standard vz.58 thread pattern). Caliber 7.62 x 39 mm Effective range – against individual targets up to 655 yds Effective range – against group targets up to 875 yds Maximum range 3,060 yds Practical rate of fire 40 shots/min.

With the vortex on there (without the magnifier) I was still hitting an approximately 12""x12"" target at roughly 175-200 meters. I was loving it. This thing is so much fun and accurate, hence the reason I'm not in a hurry. But I've already got an AR-15 so I figured I might try to diversify. Please dont call or text with B.S trades, other then that, feel free to text me your offers (prefer texts, I'm a busy person lol)IF INTERESTED, PLEASE TEXT 785-twothreesix-0449To be clear: THIS IS NOT AN SBR. HOWEVER, the ATF has recently approved shoulder firing an AR pistol brace. Since you can legally shoulder fire now, why spend the extra money? Also, since this is a PISTOL, and MANUFACTURED as such, you can legally conceal carry it as long as you're permitted.One last note: You have the internet because you're currently on it. Look up what I'm selling and the after markets and then reference sale price. If the only thing you are going to text is ""how much is the AR pistol"", then you obviously didn't do your homework, and aren't really interested. Please don't take any offense to anything I just said haha. I am in $1235 into it WITHOUT the vortex or the flip ups. I am still including the flip ups and mags, but not the optic. I'd say a $335 mark down is pretty good. Hope to hear from you!"
