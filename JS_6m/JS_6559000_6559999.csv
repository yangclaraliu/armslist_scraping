I have the original box, original cardboard sleeve that went over the box, 2 mags (one factory, one MacGar) and a custom molded FDE kydex holster. One of the smoothest, most accurate handguns I have owned or shot. You will not find one this nice without buying new! I got it in a trade, and I am just testing the waters. Make an offer on trades, I am not looking for anything in particular. I can add or take cash to trade up or down depending on what you have. Might be interested in non-firearm trades, you never know!

Located in Warren County (Northwest PA) but can ship to FFL   This revolver is old, tarnished but works! Serial number I believe dates it as a year 1896. When I first got it, the hammer was broken, so I replaced it. Cocks, advances and releases as it should. Double action does not currently work, but single action is fine. Barrel and cylinder do have some rust/pitting but looks like it can be cleaned up more. I just ran a brush through it briefly after I first got it. Both grips have a chip in the front.   I have not shot it. I'm no expert, but it can probably be a shooter with a better cleaning. Most of these old revolvers are more deserving of collector/shelf/wall status and some rest/retirement after many years of service.   The pretty ones sell for upwards of $600. Asking 200 for this one.   I'm always open to interesting trade offers. At the moment looking for a backup deer rifle and a good concealed carry pistol, but open to any offers.

Located in Warren County (Northwest PA) but can ship to FFL   This revolver is old, tarnished but works! Serial number I believe dates it as a year 1896. When I first got it, the hammer was broken, so I replaced it. Cocks, advances and releases as it should. Double action does not currently work, but single action is fine. Barrel and cylinder do have some rust/pitting but looks like it can be cleaned up more. I just ran a brush through it briefly after I first got it. Both grips have a chip in the front.   I have not shot it. I'm no expert, but it can probably be a shooter with a better cleaning. Most of these old revolvers are more deserving of collector/shelf/wall status and some rest/retirement after many years of service.   The pretty ones sell for upwards of $600. Asking 200 for this one.   I'm always open to interesting trade offers. At the moment looking for a backup deer rifle and a good concealed carry pistol, but open to any offers. Worst I'll say is ""no thank you."""

In addition, the lighter, polymer body frame has new updates for improved handling and accuracy. The internal transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear, an important safety feature. The exclusive Taurus ergonomic shock absorbing grip design provides a firm grip under virtually all shooting conditions. An extended ejector rod allows for positive extraction of fired cases. Like all standard Judge revolvers, the Public Defender Polymer fires .45 Long Colt rounds and 2-2/"" .410 Bore shotgun shells interchangeably.    Fires .45 LC & .410 Bore Interchangeably    Lightweight Polymer Frame    Extended Ejector Rod    Ribbed Rubber Grip    Red Fiber-Optic Front Sight"

Equivalent to a Springfield/Stevens /Savage Model 87A, Ranger 101, Savage Model 6, and other models. Semi-automatic tube-fed .22LR. Vintage rifle with very interesting mechanism. Known as a ""Gill Rifle"" for the unique venting slots on the side. This is nearly a complete rifle and essentially just needs the stock and the inner magazine tube. There is an inner tube included that is slightly too long, it could be modified or you could find an original matching one. I was going to convert this to a bullpup but don't have time. It could also be fit into a modified airsoft shell, carve your own stock, or some other custom project. It appears to be fully functional, the bolt cocks and fires. I have not tested with live rounds but don't see any reason it would not work. The Bluing is faded with age but there is no major rust or pitting that I can see. Appears to be drilled and tapped for two-bolt side scope mount. I will sell for $100 or will consider trades for a .22 revolver or other guns. The parts alone are worth $125+ on ebay without the receiver."

What if that bad guy has a gun pointed at your wife or daughter’s head? What then?If you do what the movies and TV always show, you are pretty much guaranteeing that you will watch your wife die, probably after worse happens, and that will be your dying thought … that you SHOULD have done something – anything.Ready Defense Labs is the ONLY force on force, simulated event firearms training in Oklahoma that is focused on delivering long-term practical defensive firearm training, hands-on practice and force on force simulated events taken from news headlines and actual events. We recreate these events so our students can experience them first hand; learning skills and techniques they can immediately apply should they ever have to face a similar traumatic event in real life.This is NOT a CCW class or a legal course – these will be courses designed to teach fundamental defensive tactics to civilians in the same manner practiced by law enforcement, military and first responders.You can read books and watch movies or videos online, but NOTHING replaces the invaluable experience of hands on training, where you get to learn in real time, learn from other’s mistakes and practice in a controlled, live fire environment.If you are interested in learning how to protect yourself and loved ones and want to take your CCW to the next level without breaking the bank then follow this link to pre-register for Ready Defense Labs Grand Opening in Summer 2017.http://ReadyDefenseLabs.com"

Clone of the popular Winchester “Gallery Gun” originally made in the early 1900s. The Gallery Gun was the preferred rifle for use in shooting galleries, carnivals and fairs because it was rugged yet light weight, fun to shoot, and it has a one screw take down feature for ease in storing and transporting. 
Many of the original or “Slide action” as they were known back in the day, only fired 22 gallery loads and 22 shorts. Often, the modern day clones by Interarms, and the Rossi rifles that followed, are only chambered for Long Rifle.
This one is the improved version and it is labeled to shoot Shorts, Long and Long Rifle loads.
This particular rifle is un-modified, in great shape, has very nice wood and shows little wear. Since they haven’t made them in many years, you are very unlikely to see another one in this condition.
In addition to having the ability to shoot a wide variety of ammo, a 30 second takedown, slim profile and being very light weight, this model has the neat feature that allows you to hold down the trigger and fire the rifle as fast as you can slide the action.
This would be a great rifle for an experienced shooter looking for a reliable travel or survival rifle that is also fun to shoot. While the light weight, pump action with visible hammer also makes it a great beginner’s rifle.
The ability to shoot most 22 ammo, a reliable pump action, and the simple take down feature would also make it a great “Just-in-case” rifle to tuck away somewhere. Cypress area. For more questions:  REDACTED, voice or text."

The action has only a couple of very minor dings, where as the stock has a few light scrapes, as well as some minor chips. There are also a small handful of nicks and cuts on both side. This shotgun featurs both a safety, as well as an action release on the side of the receiver, which is in pretty decent shape. The receiver lacks any staining, rusting, chips, cracks, or pitting, and the chamber opens up with only a little bit of stick on the part of the pump-action. This shotgun also features a 29""-long barrel that's topped with a bead sight. This shotgun's barrel does have some minor wear/tear in the form of light staining, and nicks and cuts. However, there is no rusting, or pitting in either the receiver, or the barrel. This is a nice, unique firearm that would make an excellent addition to any collection."

""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.
