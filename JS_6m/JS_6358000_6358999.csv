Must be at least 21 years old or older, be a Kentucky resident, and have proper ID to buy/trade this gun. If the ad/posting is up, then the gun is still available. I will take the posting down when the gun is sold or traded. And I will not respond to those people that sends ""text me, call me"" replies (or don't ask for my number either, since it's rude and I don't know you). I prefer communicating via emails first, and then will exchange phone numbers when time to set up a meeting. Face to face deals only. Meet around Lexington, Nicholasville or Winchester only. $750 for all. Price is FIRM. Low ball offers will not get a reply or will be ignored. Sell or trade as package deal only. Will not separate ammo, mags, etc. I like this gun a lot and nothing is wrong with it. But I just prefer my AK- 47. Thanks for looking.* Reduced cash price to $750 (was $800). Cash price is firm.

These are 100% real, with the boxes for both. Both are NV compatible. Everything works and your more than welcome to check with EOTECH that they are real. Here's the lowdown: one is a pre 2009 model made in february 2008, and the other is post 2009 made in march 2009. The difference is the battery caps. Both function flawlessly. The bad, the finish on the hood of the 2008 model show alot of wear. That being said, replacement hoods can be ordered online for 27.99, and it will look almost new again. The 2008 model I'll sell for 375, and the 2009 for 425. Will accept trades for other optics, or firearms. Also in the picture the 2009 model looks just as worn, but I already ordered and have installed the new parts, and it is now like new, with little wear. If i do the same for the 2008, Its price will go up by 30 also.UPDATE: called eotech and they said they are available for return for full MSRP. You can get full msrp if you return them, but they told me it is a 8-10 week wait time after they receive them. I don't want to wait that long, so here they are for someone with more patience than me.Will sell both together for 650.These are the 552, not the cheaper 512 version. as these are NV compatible. if you want the cheaper version look elsewhere, as I will not beat a price on a screenshot for a lesser model. Topping it off with the fact that you can still get full msrp for them, this is a deal, and I wont go any lower."

These bare receivers had the Eagle of Saladin crest with ""Egyptian Army"" in Arabic inscribed under the eagle.All these bare Eagle crested receivers were sold to Century in the early 1950s along with the rest of Egypt's inventory of spare parts and rifles.Century assembled these 1,500 Eagle crested rifles here in the U.S. using their inventory of new old stock parts.

This was $375 when bought this week. I bought two and keeping one, my wife is sticking to her 1-4 scope.No wonder why the FBI awarded SIG the contract for their red dot fielding over Aimpoint, Trijicon, EoTech, and Vortex in December 2016.this puts it all together with the lifetime transferable warranty to go with.ROMEO4 is the ultimate red-dot sight when fast, accurate target acquisition is a must. Whether it’s a moving target, dangerous game at full charge, or a fast breaking tactical  situation at close quarters. When things are moving fast and you need to get on target in  a hurry, your sight has to work faster. No matter the lighting conditions, weather  conditions, or terrain, the ROMEO4 red-dot sight has you covered-—when it counts.  You can shoot with confidence with both eyes open, on target yet aware of the situation  at all times as it unfolds. And because it is a SIG SAUER®, you know the ROMEO4  is as tough and dependable as our firearms.Romeo4 sights are parallax-free so point-of-aim is point-of-impact and the red dot remains parallel to the bore of your firearm, no matter what your viewing angle is relative to the optical axis of the sight. Dual reticle option, on select models, toggle between 2 MOA red dot or circle dot (2 MOA red dot with 65 MOA circle)Unlimited eye-relief allows you to acquire the aiming point and the target regardless of the position of your eye behind the sight. Features our MOTAC (Motion Activated Illumination System) that powers up when it senses motion and powers down when it does not. Provides for optimum operational safety and enhanced battery life. Extremely strong and lightweight aircraft grade CNC Aluminum housing ensures a lifetime of reliable service."

I opened the B/Creek mag packaging just so I could insert it in the pistol to take pics. If you want to add an additional $27.99, I'll toss in the 2nd Intratech mag. The Intratech mags look like 15 round or so capacity (my guess?- might only be 10 rounders). Has a threaded barrel. Appears to be a low round example. Seems to function well. Has the manual, but no other paperwork. Looks very cool. If I were to keep it, I would add a 1 point sling, but you would need to install a place to attach to sling.

The Helmet Light features a durable, watertight polymer body that comes in tan. It attaches via a special mount that clamps semi-permanently to the rim of any Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH) by means of two socket-head machine screws. Once the mount is attached, the light can be easily slid onto the mount, where it locks in place; depressing a small lever slides it right off, so the Helmet Light can be quickly removed for servicing or transport onto its optional Z71 carry clip, which attaches to any MOLLE or ALICE vest.Features Made of durable glass-filled nylon polymer and neopreneO-ring sealed, watertight bodyTwo toggle switches and a pressure switch for total controlWhite and red LEDs and infrared IFF LED beaconLong runtime from a single 123A battery with 10-year shelf lifeEasily removable for servicing or transfer to other helmetsSize: 2.2 W x 2.6 H x 1.3 thick including mountWeight: 3.1 oz. with battery and mountOutput/Runtime:White High: 19.2 lumens/6 hrsRed High: 2.5 lumens/20 hrsWhite Med: 5.0 lumens/28 hrsRed Med: 0.8 lumens/48 hrsWhite Low: 1.4 lumens/48hrsRed Low: 0.3 lumens/96 hrsTertiary IFF beacon: 1.72 mW/120 hrsAvailable in tan body colorBattery included"

The Silver Pigeon I is built on the legendary 686 action, a long-standing favorite among hunters and competitive shooters. It features two conical locking lugs at mid-action, right between the barrels, giving it great locking strength and durability while keeping the action’s profile considerably lower. The advantage is that the eye of the shooter is a lot closer to the plane of his supporting hand: considerably better swing and hand-eye coordination. While not as elaborately decorated as our premium shotguns, the Silver Pigeon I has all the elegance that you can expect from a Beretta. The oil-finished stock sports a beautiful and crisp checkering pattern, and the schnabel fore-end adds to the classic flavor of this over-under."

I measured the muzzle with my calipers and it is just over 3/16 inches, or 5.2mm. The barrel is 2.75 inches the muzzle is hexagon shaped and still has visible rifling. And stamped or cast onto the hex part of the barrel is ""cast steel"" and ""459"". Also if the wooden handle is removed there is another ""459"" on the metal frame. I have found several .31, .32, .34, .36 caliber pistols that Ethan Allen had made as E. Allen; Allen & Thurber; Allen & Wheelock; or as E. Allen & CO. I have measured the muzzle to be .22 inches, but without any other similar pistols I am uncertain of what ""caliber"" the manufacturer called it. I would also consider trades, I have a preference for anything russian made. Like SVT 40, RPK, PSL, AK's, saiga 12/20/410 shotguns, etc. But if you are interested let me know what you got and we will see.Also since this was made before January 1, 1900 this is not considered a firearm by the Federal guidlines so this can be shipped directly to you, no FFL needed.
