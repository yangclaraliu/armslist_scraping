It is a flat-top upper, with a fixed A2 sight, fixed front sight post, looks like a .8** something bull barrel under the handguards and a .750 the rest of the way out. I want the lightest weight pencil barrel i can get ahold of. M4 profile is ok, but i would like the .625 barrel the whole length. I would trade for a fixed carry handle upper. Would trade for a removeable carry handle upper. I'll keep my factory handguards if you have magpul or something. Mine has a full auto BCG. Holler at me if you have an offer to trade!

Compact and powerful, the Thunder Pro UC is an excellent choice for those who need stopping power without bulk. Preserving the best features of the standard Thunder Pro, the Thunder Pro Ultra Compact is a superior value in a compact, service grade handgun.
Like the standard Pro, the Thunder Pro UC features an improved Browning Petter barrel locking system which provides reliable feeding and ejection. The safety, cocking lever, slide stop levers and magazine catch are completely ambidextrous making this a perfect fit for right or left handers. The Thunder Pro UC maintains the Bersa tradition of accuracy, reliability and durability and is an excellent choice for anyone needing a tough, reliable, compact sidearm.
The frame and slide has been professionally refinshed with KG Gun KoteSeries 2500 Metallics in Black Chrome and as you can see in the pics it looks sweet!  The barrel hood has been polished as well as the frame has some slight ""carry meld"" treatment to reduce edges.  The gun has performed flawlessly for me and I have ran approximately 100 rounds of only high quality FMJ, no +P even though it is certainly rated to fire them.  I also replaced the standard 3 dot sights with the Sig P226 type front and rear sights as described below.  The barrel rifling is polygonal in perfect condition with no lead ammo been fired through it.I can provide more pictures upon request.I am asking $350 obo.  No lowballers please as I am asking a very fair price.

The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Very Rare in this Condition.
Box is the one that came with this gun with correct Serial # on it. It has a small hole where bolt pushed thru about the center of the Tomahawk handle.
It appears that someone cycled the bolt at one time, however, it also appears to never have been shot. I bought this gun 37 years ago and stored it away. It still had the NIB tag on it, and I have never had reason to think different.
I have 30 photos, most of them close up and very clear, giving you a detailed look at how pristine the gun is. The only mark on it is on the bolt where it was cycled. Ask if you would like to see more.
NO RUST!
You may never find another in this condition.
Model 600 and 660 rifles - except those with a serial number beginning with an ""A"" before the serial number - were subject to the 1979 recall. This gun has the ""A"" in the serial number. However, it also has the ""V"" on the left side of trigger. So I don't know if the gun came that way, or it was sent back and modified by Remington.

JHP XTP, 300 Gr. JHP Custom Heavies, and those amazing 225 Gr. Poly ballistic-tipped JHP Leverevlolution.  The other brands quickly are: Corbon High Velocity 1650 FPS 180 Gr. JHP, Winchester Platinum bonded HP, Winchester JSP, Federal Power Shok JHP, Barnes Vortex Solid Copper HP, CCI steel shot shell, a gasket sealed dry box, 50 round ammo organizer plastic storage case, and a fresh packet of Stack-on dessicant moisture absorber.  This ammo is aged between 5 years and 1 year old but most of it is about 3 years old that I bought for the Ruger Redhawk I had.  It was always stored in air tight, moisture proof containers with moister absorbing dessicant packs.  If you remember the Copper or Lead shortage and the run on ammo a few years back you know I probably paid more than the estimated $250-$300 for most of this ammo.  Serious buyers Text first to let me know you are interested in my Armslist ammo listing.  For more info email me and I'll send it to you.  Obviously this must be stated in the listing:  Since I am not a FFL dealer I can only sell to individuals within my own state of Louisiana.   That being said I am located in Rapides Parish and spend time in the Baton Rouge Area but I will travel any reasonable distance within the state Which should be accommodating since I live right in the middle of it.  I am a man of my word, but it goes without saying that I will want to meet in a public place during daylight hours to make a transaction.  Thanks for checking out my listing.  I hope to hear from a fellow firearm enthusiast soon.  Mobile Phone is REDACTED.  email myoccamsrazor at yahoo.   Please do not contact about anything but the listing.  Also I'm NOT interested in trades. I only want to sell this ammo.  Thank you for respecting my privacy."
