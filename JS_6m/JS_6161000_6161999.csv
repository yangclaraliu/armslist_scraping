Improved materials and manufacturing methods have made the PMAG M3 magazine perform to a higher standard in all tests: durability, impact strength, chemical resistance, and exposure to extreme temperatures. Internally, a new low friction, 4-way anti-tilt follower and enhanced constant curve geometry (30 and 40-Round PMAGs) further increase feeding reliability in adverse conditions. Externally, the M3 PMAG has been significantly strengthened in the feed lip and spine areas to better withstand direct impacts when loaded to full capacity. The new Gen M3 has also been engineered to be compatible with a wider variety of magazine pouches via a smaller profile floorplate (which also boasts improved drainage capability) and lower profile ribs on either side of the magazine's body. These ""smoother"" side ribs are complemented by the addition of horizontal grooves molded into the front- and back-straps of the body to ensure a positive grip in all conditions. The integration of eight dot-matrix panels (four on each side) enables the shooter to positively mark and identify magazines in a clear and abrasion-resistant way. The PMAG Gen M3 incorporates additional external improvements to the magazine catch and bolt catch notch areas that have expanded its firearm compatibility to include more than the AR-15 platform alone. M3 PMAGs are fully functional with the FN SCAR-16, the British SA-80, and the HK416/IAR/M27 platforms. The drop-free characteristics of the PMAG were also improved to ensure compatibility with a wider range of magazine wells, including those with tighter tolerances than mil-spec. Made in the USA.Not interested in trades. Price is firm."

NOTE:The most noticeable feature of the Target Rifle is the HARMONIC BARREL TUNER. This device is attached near the muzzle, and by loosening four Allen screws, a shooter can fine tune the barrel vibrations for the best accuracy with a particular load. The device has a wide latitude of adjustment, and works along the same principle as the Browning BOSS system introduced a few years ago, but the Ruger unit is much more substantial and offers a much wider range of adjustment. The rifle can be fired with the harmonic tuner in any position, or with the unit completely removed from the weapon. In practice, it works just like a handloader fine tuning his load for the best accuracy, but the Ruger device offers the same tuning advantage even when using factory ammunition, with the minute adjustments made to the rifle instead of the ammunition.

(est mfg date 1907) 12 ga with short US marked barrel. Barrel is 18.5"" with mfg date of 1944. The gun looks to have been reblued at some point but looks good. Barrel is not original to the gun but makes for a neat riot type shotgun. I have only ran bird shot through it but it works great. contact for more pictures"
