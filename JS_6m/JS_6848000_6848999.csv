This musket is one of approximately 14,000 muskets delivered between 1798 and 1801 from 26 different contractors. These muskets are rarely encountered today due to the poor overall quality of them when new. By the time of the War of 1812, most of these muskets had been condemned and sold as surplus from US stores. The musket offered here is nearly devois of markings, save for a US stamp at the rear of the lock. This is not dissimilar to marks found on Revolutionary War arms inventoried in the late 1780s. The only other markings are a single eagle head over raised P proof on the barrel, which according to George Moller's ""American Military Shoulder Arms, Volume 2"" is an indicator of Pennsylvania or Maryland production. There is also a small roman numeral XII on the left side of the upper barrel band, which may be an original assembly mark, or perhaps a reassembly mark following this musket's percussion alteration. Other parts do not bare this mark. It features a correct 44 and 1/16 inch barrel, and maintains the remnants of the detachable faceted iron pan typical of American muskets based on the French M1763/66 designs. This example managed to avoid being sent overseas to Africa or South America like so many, but was subsequently percussion altered. The percussion alteration is of the ""Belgian"" or ""drum"" style typically found on civilian alterations. However, the hammer is very well made, and is almost certainly of a military application. It is not too dissimilar from percussion alterations done by the firm of J.P. Murray during the Civil War. I feel that it is likely a Confederate alteration, but the exact arsenal or contractor is unknown at this time.The stock has been cleaned, lightly sanded, and reoiled at some time. Metal parts were apparently cleaned at the same time, but have taken an attractive gun metal patina. Although cleaned, the gun displays very well. The main issues worth noting are that the ramrod is about 3/4 of an inch short, and lacks threads, and that the percussion cone is mashed. The lock functions, albiet stiffly, and may have had the mainspring replaced at some point.Overall this is a nice example of a very scarce American military longarm that will make a nice addition to your collection.Please feel free to contact me with questions."

It's ultra-concealable, accurate and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine.

251,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6848251,For Sale:  Confederate Altered M1816 Musket,"Mt. Pleasant, Texas, United States","$ 1,700","Listed On: Thursday, May 18, 2017",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale is a Confederate percussion altered Model 1816 Musket. This example was altered to percussion by the Union Manufacturing Company of Richmond, Virginia. The Union Manufacturing Company performed aproximately 10,000 percussion alterations for the State of Virginia in 1861 and 1862. These arms are identified in by their unique ""U"" shaped bolster. This example was one of 160 Model 1816 muskets from Marine T. Wickham's contract owned by Virginia in 1860. This musket has been cleaned, both metal and stock, but still displays well. The stock has been sanded and refinished, but a partial cartouche remains. The metal is developing a pewter patina and is free from all active rust. The percussion nipple is missing, and the bolster displays worn threads, but a replacement cone could probably be fitted with minimal issues. The ramrod is full length and retains the original threaded end for the attachment of cleaning implements. I am confident that the hammer is a replacement, and is probably from a Henry Leman alteration. It is of similar proportion to the original percussion hammer and displays well enough. With some searching a replacement hammer could probably be had.For the money this is a very nice musket that fills an important part of any Confederate collection, or collection of percussion altered arms.Shipping can be arranged. Please contact me with any questions."

Drawing from several tables and taking into account a number of real-time external factors it automatically gives the shooter the exact yardage at which a bullet will hit. Once the distance to the target has been estimated the computer can be put into action by turning the elevation knob until the LCD displays the target's range. Three internal sensors automatically calculate the ballistic solution. BORS compensates for temperature, changes in air pressure and aiming at an upward or downward angle. BORS even determines if the rifle is canted. BORS kit includes the proprietary Barrett Ballistic Software (requires Windows XP or higher and is not directly MAC OS compatible) that's pre-programmed with a library of common projectiles and velocities selected by Barrett.

In my opinion it is the best carry pistol available. Pistol comes with (2) six round magazines. Pistol is new unfired from the factory:
 
The G43 is our new single stack, 9mm pistol. The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCKs history. The G43 is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It's ultra-concealable, accurate and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other GLOCK pistols.If you are interested in buying,  kindly contact me via e-mail or text me on my number (850) 800-0731"

Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots. First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was. Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. Designed to minimize creep and stacking, the P-10’s trigger breaks at a clean 4-4.5 lbs and rebounds with a short, positive reset, meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt. Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1.Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market. It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package.  We accept visa/mastercard/discover at a 3% loss of cash. USPS money orders same as cash.If sending money order you will be required to obtain & send tracking number. 15.00 Shipping. NC. residence pay 6.75% sales tax.

It's ultra-concealable, accurate and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine.

It had a 1911 body style, with custom grips and a rail system that let me add a light and laser combo. Black, it had a bull barrel and was an excellent gun – until it took a frag for me in Fallujah. I was actually able to get it repaired – those Springfields are tough.” In a wide partnership that includes the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation — with Kyle’s wife Taya at the helm — Springfield Armory, the retailer Gun Broker, and the upcoming National Rifle Association convention, the number one pistol in the series is currently up for auction on gunbroker.com. The pistol’s in-person transfer from original owner Taya Kyle to the buyer will be made at the Springfield Armory booth at , located the NRA show in Louisville. Bidding has already begun online, but a dramatic, live-bidding finale is planned. Taya Kyle was presented with the pistol by Springfield Armory at the 2016 SHOT Show. Her immediate response included plans for a benefit auction. Springfield’s president and chief executive officer, Dennis Reese, will also be on hand for the announcement of the winning bid, and will present a check to Kyle, representing the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation, in the amount of the final bid. “We felt it appropriate to make this special edition pistol to honor [Chris Kyle’s] memory and support the ongoing work of the foundation,” Reese said. “Very much like American hero Chris Kyle, this pistol is truly one of a kind.” Springfield will produce one thousand TRP Legend Series pistols, each with a unique serial number ranging from CK0001 through CK1000. The first gun in the series was presented to Taya Kyle, who donated it to benefit the foundation named for her husband. In addition to the donation of proceeds from the first in the series, Springfield has volunteered to donate a portion of the profit from the sales of the other firearms in the limited edition to the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation, which offers support to military and first-responders. As part of the Springfield Legend pistol series, the TRP Chris Kyle series feature a five-inch stainless steel match grade barrel, low-profile three-dot tritium combat sights, and black and gray G10 grips with American flag engraving. The slides are forged carbon steel with black Nitride treatment. A full-length guide rod by National Match completes the 8.6-inch long, government model 1911. Each pistol ships with two seven-round stainless steel magazines with slam pads. Pistols in the series will be packaged in a serialized mahogany presentation case. A memorial copy of the best-selling book, American Sniper, signed by Taya Kyle, will be included, as will a .999 pure silver Chris Kyle limited edition challenge coin, and a Springfield certificate of authenticity."

The barrel is 2"" and it is in a traditional silvery finish. It has brown plastic Rossi grips, and i also have another set of rubber grips i will throw in as well. Im unsure how old the revolver is but i bought it used a few years ago so it could be pretty old, especially since it is not plus P rated. Aesthetically it has some scratches on the cylinder and the sides of the revolver and most noteably there is a chunk of the left side of (forgive the description of this part) piece that forms a half circle. The previous owner did this and i am confused by it but it does not alter the functionality of the revolver. I will take cash offers.but im mainly looking to trade. Im interested in a .410 shotgun in any action or a double barrel shotgun in any gauge. Will consider hunting rifles as well."

The G43 is our new single stack, 9mm pistol. The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCKs history. The G43 is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It's ultra-concealable, accurate and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other GLOCK pistols."

I have installed tacticool upgrade parts which include dampening pads inside the buffer tube (also helps with recoil and rise, plus causes less wear on bolt group, the thing is so smooth shooting it)  also a rubber grip was added to the charging handle to improve  user grip and comfort, a rubber buffer tube cover for better check weld and comfort, a magpul angled foregrip, and one mlock weaver rail added to left side of handrail to hold the optic when the gun is in folded position. Under the front of the foregrip is a iprotec laser+light, laser is red-fully adjustable and the light is I believe 300 lumens that has two modes: normal flashlight and flashing mode (for disorientation or signaling), plenty bright if u ask me. For an extra $50 I will give you the optic Iv been using on it, a Swiss arms red-green holo sight, it has 4 different reticles and 5 different brightness settings, no scratches or dents on the lens, maybe some minor cosmetic wear on the housing, it's a quick detach sight, so you can quickly mount it on the gun for use or move it to the mlock rail for storage during folded positions, it does hold its zero just fine between detachments.  Everything is in good working order and has been thouroughly maintained, this is an awesome gun and hate to sell it but unfortunately I need the money and I just have too many guns (if there was such a thing), text me if you have any questions or want more photos at REDACTED."
