The highly-rated HK VP precision strike trigger is also found on the VPSK. The VP trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The net result is trigger quality unmatched in production striker fired pistols. A small-scale interpretation of the completely adjustable VP grip feature-consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels - is replicated in the compact grip frame of the VP9SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit any individual user and is a feature found only on Heckler & Koch handguns. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol's grip also instinctively position an operator's hand for optimal shooting. The VPSK has the features of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide release are present on both sides of the frame and the paddle style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. HK's patented charging supports, found on full size VP pistols, are also present on the VPSK. The charging supports are simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. VPSK pistol can use a vareity of proven HK magazines, including compact double stack 10-roiund and 13-round with either flat or extended floorplates for a more ergonomic grip. The VPSK can also use the same high capacity 15-round magazine used by the full size VP and P30 handguns. Magazine sleeves that replicate the grip profile of the VP handgun are also available. VPSK pistols have an abbreviated Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into their polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. VPSK pistols use a proprietary captive flat recoil spring that hels reduce the recoil forces affecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component life span. HK's famous cold hammer forged barrel - made from cannon grade steel - ensures a long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VPSK's machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK's hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. Despite their small size, VPSK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. VPSK models are currently available in 9mm. VPSK pistols are made in Heckler & Koch's Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany and are well suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. A high quality and well-engineered design, the VP9SK possesses all the features and long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis.

At 50 yrds,  I was consistantly hitting within a 3 inch circle/red target with only its iron sights.It would be even tighter with a scope. I added an attachment for the handle, so you can add opticsIt has one flaw. The bottom forearm grip has a chunk broken off. It doesn't affect it at all and can easily and cheaply replace. I don't bother because it has rubber strips that goes over that spot to cover it up. No one knows unless you tell them.It also has, what looks like a S&W revolver pistol grip. I thought how weird at first glance, then I shot it and liked it. It can also be easily replaced, but I like it."

This is the dual illuminated version so no batteries required ever! And don't let the 12.9 MOA size reticle scare you off, most think that's too big but that's actually the size of the entire triangle. IMO It's not a large reticle at all. I use the tip of the triangle, which is said to be 0.8moa, for precise shots and then the whole thing for close up/quick shots. This is my second rmr08 that I bought on a whim but now decided I don't need it, never been used or zeroed. Right now it's mounted on a rm35 boss mount for an acog.

Barrel has been shortened to about 22.5 inches, stock cut down, bolt handle bent, and a black enamel type finish applied to most of the blued parts.Stock has a pretty decent crack behind the receiver tang as pictured. Mechanically fine, feeds and cycles rounds alright, but I have never fired it.

Would probably require some minor fitting. let me know if you want pics of it.Prefer to meet at Field & Stream Easton or somewhere near thereAsking $180 cash or best offer."

The completely adjustable P30 grip feature — consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels — is replicated in the ultra-compact grip frame of the P30SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user. And like its larger frame counterparts, the P30SK is available in multiple trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “Law Enforcement Modification (LEM).” For the P30SK, the LEM trigger is configured with a “light strike V1” setup — requiring approximately 5.4 pounds-force to pull the trigger. Other trigger modes include conventional double action/single action (DA/SA) with a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. The DA/SA mode is available with and without dual ambidextrous manual safeties located on the left and right side of the frame. Other ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety. An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. All P30SK models have been extensively tested during a three year development process. Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot; currently available in 9 mm. Key Features:  Non-radioactive luminescent three dots sights for fast target acquisition. Accessory night sights also available. P30SKS variant has ambidextrous safety levers located on both sides of the slide V3 Double Action/Single Action model has spurred hammer and decocking lever. LEM variants have a no-snag bobbed hammer. 6 grip panels and 3 backstraps can be easily changed for a custom fit  Specifications:  Caliber: 9x19mm Length: 9.42"" Height: 4.57"" Width: 1.37"" Barrel Length: 3.27"" Weight (with Empty Magazine): 23.99 oz Magazine Capacity: 10"

Not a tack driver but it is a kick to shoot without breaking the bank.
It was part of a trade deal and just doesn’t fit into what I shoot.
It is extremely clean front to back. Shiney bore and all surfaces clean. No issues with anything that I saw.. The only “problem” is original latch for rear housing has been replaced with a straight pin as opposed to a “L” shaped latch.
It was in a Tapco synthetic stock and the young man I got it from had decided to paint the original wood stock camo. Needless to say I stripped it down and reoiled it to its original finish. I just like the original look better, but I am including the Tapco stock as well. No Problems with it I just am not fond of them.
I deburred the trigger assembly as well, so runs as smooth as any SKS I have ever shot.
Took it to the range and it shot fine and gets a lot of looks taking AK mags.
I have since changed it back to wood stock and have not sighted it in.
It will never be a “sniper” rifle but it does good and will put them where you want.
Depends on what you read, but the VOMZ P8x56 is nice I feel. A bit big for an SKS but what the hell. I am also including the original rear housing, if buyer decides they don’t want it scoped. Also somewhat unique to this SKS is that the Spike bayonet is removable, it can be unclipped from the bayonet lug without tools.
These are damn near indestructible and will last well beyond a great deal of the stuff made today.
 
I believe that these were imported into the US starting in 1988 (only year they were allowed to be imported with the bayonet). Subsequent imports had the bayonet and lug removed.
The ""D"" is not really a model, just what dealer's started calling them due to the detachable magazine. You won't see a ""D"" stamp or anything like that.
A true ""D"" model will have a 20"" barrel, with the bayonet lug and spike bayonet attached. The stock would be in the standard configuration, usually with a unsealed finish.
The “D” is one of the hardest to find SKS’s there are. Built for AK Mags not reworked for fit. Spike bayonet (detachable), 20” barrel and wood stock. Not many nicer than this one.

This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 – 8.5 pounds of pressure (32.5 – 37.8 Newtons), compared to 12 – 15 pounds (53.4 – 66.7 N) found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.     Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the Subcompact.     The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. For shooters that prefer a conventional double-action/single-action pistol, a double-action/single-action variant is also available with a decock button mounted on the rear of the frame. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter’s hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters.     A set of abbreviated “industry standard” mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 SK also can use widely available, reliable USP Compact magazines. Available in 9 mm, .40 S&W.   Specifications:  Caliber: 9X19mm Overall Length: 6.40"" Overall Height: 4.55"" Overall Width: 1.27"" Barrel Length: 3.26"" Sight Radius: 5.18"" Weight with Magazine: 24 oz Weight with Empty Magazine: 1.50 lb Magazine Capacity: 10 Rounds Single Action Trigger Pull: 4.50 lbs Double Action Trigger Pull: 11.47 lbs Sights: 3-Dot"

The 3rd Gen was the last one that they used the now highly sought after 1st Gen trigger pack in. The rifle is flawless mechanically with some minor consmetic blemishes on the rail (from the red dot sight I had mounted on it) but is in like new condition otherwise.Unfortunately I did not keep any of the original packaging but I am including 2 geniun FN factory 50 round mags. This gun was a blast to shoot but I shoot more pistols than I do rifles so it just doesn't get used. Asking $1,100. Feel free to make offers but my price is fairly firm as PS90s generally sell for higher than I'm asking and the ones with the 1st gen trigger pack go for even more. Not interested in trades.

A lot of things have been added to this gun when it was purchased new, originally intended to use it as a concealed/competition gun. The gun has been a complete safe queen and has had less than 400 rounds run through it, during its entire lifetime. Starting off the list I replaced the guide rod with a custom tungsten guide rod. This helps add weight to the front of the gun making it better balanced for faster follow up shots. Next I have a replacement guide rod spring. This heavy wolf spring is great for a trip to the range, or you could use the standard one from the factory which is also included. I replaced the sights with TFO night sites when it was purchased, these sights last fifteen years, so they have thirteen years left of life in them. I added talon grip tape to the grip to aid it for concealed carry. I also replaced the rolling pin to aid the durability and reliability. Unlike the standard rolling pin, the new one will last a lifetime of dry firing. I replaced the striker with a Springer striker to make the weapon more reliable. The striker status indicator has also been replaced with a Powder River Precision titanium indicator to help speed up follow up shots. The xdm includes its original case and accessories. It includes a mag carrier, mag loader, and holster from the factory that now no longer comes with the standard XDM. I also am including a custom made appendix inside the wasteband holster made by concealment solutions for the gun. This is a great holster made with custom kydex, and horseleather. The gun comes with its original 3 magazines.
Let’s break it down
The gun new is valued at $630 new Tungston guide rod $70 Wolf Spring $15 Sights $80 (Not charging for the custom installation $50) Talon Grips $16 Holster $70 Rolling pin $5 Striker $50 Striker status indicator $25
The XDM Mag carrier and holster, aren’t standard anymore, springfield charges $100 for them now.
Cash only, no trades of any kind, not even partial trades. This set is worth appx 1061. I’m asking for $820 I feel this is a fair number. I also have a Gunvault MV500-STD gunsafe. This is a wonderful safe that held the XDM as a nightstand gun. It’s valued new at $80; I’d throw it in for an extra $40. Gunsafe plus the set is $860"
