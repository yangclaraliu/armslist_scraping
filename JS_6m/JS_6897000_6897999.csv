Included is a leather hornady sling and the original 3 mags. It shoots great i simply dont see myself ever going hunting with it as i had purchased it for as health issues have gotten in the way. I also bought it for hiking and camping but have bought a pistol that works for that now.As for the condition of the rifle, its looks good and shoots well. To date, i have put 50 rounds down range and it has all been IMI 7.62 Mil-spec brass. (still have the brass) It does have 1 small scratch from a safe bump. Its the size of a quarter (its very small). Taken out 3 times. 10rnds for break in and sight in on the first trip, 20rnds second and 20rnds the third trip. The bolt isnt the smoothest thing ive ever operated, but neither is my savage axis.

They ran $350 new and it doesn't have a scratch on it. The Mount was with the scope new in its box as well and was $45. The riser mount was $30 online and the sling was $39.99.(I only have 1 main rifle case so it will be protected to the FFL so please bring a rifle bag unless you dont have one in which case i will throw in a ""gun bag"" protective sleeve bag if its helpful.)*     *     *    *    *    *    *    *Im asking $760 (Or Best Reasonable Cash Offer) NO TAX and you pay FFL fee localy.

This rifle, serial #353 was manufactured in 1887, which is the first year of production. It comes with a Colt Factory letter confirming its original configuration. The letter states that the gun was shipped to E.C. Meacham Arms Company, St. Louis, Missouri on September 9th of 1887 with 10 rifles total in shipment. Being that the gun was sent to St. Louis shows this rifle was one of the arms that was on its way to the western frontier. There were only 6,496 of these big rifles produced during the period of 1887 to 1894 as compared to nearly 90,000 rifles produced for the medium and small frame Lightning's. Then comparing the small number of large frame Lightning rifles to the numbers of Winchester Model 1886 and the Marlin models 1881 and 1895, which all numbered into the hundred of thousands, one can understand just how rare the large frame Lightning really is.Not looking for trades but will consider shipping if needed."

It comes with dual tuckable struts and soft loops. Of course, as with any holster with soft loops, the loops can be adjusted to fit 1.25"", 1.5"", and 1.75"" belts. I purchased it last week, tried it for a few days in various configurations, and found out that I prefer carrying without a light attached to the pistol. I clipped the tip of one of the loops off while exploring different configuration options (it protruded beyond the end of the plastic strut the way I had it set up at the time), so it can only be adjusted for 1.25"" and 1.5"" belt widths. The other loop is unaltered. Replacement loops and/or overhook struts can be ordered directly from Raven Concealment if desired.Location: Cary, NC.Condition: Mint (has been drawn ~10x, and worn for about 4 hours altogether)Price: $45 shipped ($75 new, without shipping costs added - tuckable soft loops ad $10 on CnC's website)."

It was mounted on a rifle for display purposes only. Item was removed when rifle sold and owner wanted a different BUIS setup installed. MATECH sights are notorious for having a weak rail recoil screw that can snap of over tightened. This one was replaced with the stronger uupgraded Recoil screw from LWRC. Below are all of the specs listed by the manufacturer. (It's a lot of language that I can sum up for you: this sight has faithfully served the US Army for a long time because it works very well at various engagement ranges and is extremely durable). U.S. Army Standard-Issue Backup Sight For M4/M16A4Current U.S. Army standard-issue backup rear sight for M4 carbines and M16A4 rifles flips up instantly at the touch of your thumb when primary sight fails or tactical situation makes iron sights preferable. Designed in conjunction with Picatinny Arsenal engineering staff and rigorously tested at Fort Benning and Aberdeen Proving Ground for robustness, ease of use, and effective targeting out to 600 meters. Detent-locking lever lets you quickly switch to one of eight range settings: 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 meters. Adjust windage easily with grooved, A2-style windage knob and position markers on the back of the sight for repeatability of settings. Bright, white, laser etched numbers and markers are clearly visible even in low light. Rugged machined steel construction ensures sight retains zero even under heavy, full-auto fire. Clamps securely to the rearmost slot of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style accessory rail on flattop receiver via simple but strong locking bar and bolt. Rounded corners and beveled edges further reduce danger of snagging on other gear when sight post is down. Regulates correctly with A2 front sight on any AR-15-style rifle or carbine; instructions included for adjusting front sight post height to set exact zero. Designed to co-witness with most non-magnifying optical sights."
