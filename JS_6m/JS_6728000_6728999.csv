This way, you can set your plate carrier up for either RH or LH use by either putting the RH plate in front, and the LH plate in the back (which will put the Comfort Cut of the back plate on the RH side!) or the LH plate in front and the RH plate in back, putting both Comfort Cuts on the LH side.  All 4 plates have had all edges and corners rounded so they don't cut away at your plate carrier, and all 4 plates have been Line-X COATED for Spall/Frag mitigation.
These are Stand-Alone plates cut from Certified Level III Mil-Spec MIL-A46100 Armor Plate!....which has been tested to Military Specs and been proven on the battlefield, over and over.  This is NOT AR500 or HY-100.   A46100 was specifically designed from the start by THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE to be used as Ballistic Armor Plate!  This is the best of the best armor plate that you can buy.  Each and every sheet of material is Brinell tested at 2 corners to assure quality and hardness and comes with the certificates pictured.  Sheets of AR500 are HALF the price of A46100.  Yes...A46100 is double the price per sheet.  
These plates are 100% made in America.  
By purchasing you agree to this and all terms listed on this page. In addition, YOU are responsible to ensure that your ballistic panels are properly inserted and installed. We are not responsible for any injury or death as a result of the use or misuse of this product.  No armor is ""bullet-proof.

To be clear this is NOT a Rifle Dynamics rifle. It was taken by me through their armorers course and was stripped down and inspected by RD staff. This included bolt disassembly, inspection of rivets and taking the gun as far apart as possible without using a press or resizing holes. It has ran great and has somewhere between 500-1k rounds. Built off of a Bulgarian parts kit (which RD states are the nicest coming into the country as of now). Has a rare ""zig-zag"" comp on 24mm threads. Rear sight has a variation of the ""Fuller sight mod"" done by myself which turned out very well. Also has tapco G2 trigger and Bulgarian wood which shows wear but is solid with no visible cracks. Excellent rifle that won't disappoint.Only reason I'm looking to sell is I was able to pick up an RD 501.I realize the price is higher that some other guns but this is a ""vetted"" gun with some history.not looking for trades but worst I can say is no, MUST have CCW."

In the picture you see that Ranger is in cursive writing any other Ranger you look up it's going to say Ranger and all capital letters those are the ones that range from 300 to 400 this is not one of those. The information I found about the ranger 20 gauge double barrel shotguns with Ranger on them and cursive writing it's the little to no information about them except for if you search hard enough you can find out that there were up to almost 1800 I am not asking 1800 that's just what I found them to be valued up to if you're interested in it make me some type of offer and I will get back to you as soon as possible thank you.

It's only seen 23 rounds. Lightning trigger. Sadly, I'm not sure when I'll be able to hunt again and this rifle should do what it's meant to do. Rifle comes with scope, comfortable sling, box and a handful premium of rounds. The scope alone was $350 and another $350 spent on the rifle. Sling was $25 and box was $25 as well. So I put $750 into it. I'm interested in trades valued between $700-$600. Or $650 cash. I'm open to all trades with the exception of other hunting rifles. No need. FFL transfer only. You pay for transfer on sale or we pay our own on trade. Thanks for looking.Tim"
