These are not Makarov pistols, but do fire the same caliber cartridge 9x18/9mm Makarov. Manufactured at the world-famous Radom Circle 11 plant in Poland, this is an excellent choice for combat, self-defense, open or concealed carry, target practice/range gun, or simply an addition to any respectable firearm collection. The double-action trigger pull is difficult so that it will not accidentally discharge with the hammer de-cocked and a live round in the chamber while carrying. The single-action trigger pull is extremely short, crisp, and enjoyable. This pistol can be taken down and re-assembled quickly with ease. These come from Poland used by Polish Military and Police and may or may not show slight use. They are still in the inventories of Polish Armed Forces and Police to this day. Very Good Condition.   These are stock photos – exact condition will vary.   Must be 21+ years of age to purchase.   Price: $269.99 each"

A little bit about the AR15.......The barrel is free floating with a radical arms moe round rail, the moe round rail will fit the magpul moe adapters, picatinny rail sections, and magpul moe attachments. The bolt carrier group was MPI Inspected and the bolt carrier group and barrel both were melonite treated. The barrel is also chambered as true 5.56 but will still fire 223 and has an m4 profile with m4 feed ramps. The lower is a low walled anderson and is mil-spec and it has a mil spec trigger group. The buffer tube is also mil spec. The rifle cycles well and the melonite treated parts will last a lifetime.

The serial number dates it to Feb. 1887, which puts in the right year to be a Cadet Rifle. The barrel is 29 1/2"" and it's crowned so it appears that it hasn't been cut. It appears to have been refinished with really dark blueing, I don't recall seeing one this dark before. Someone tried to tell me that Westpoint used them like this but I can't find anything about that. The stock has a repair on the comb, but it's really old and was done really well. The cartouche is still viable and readable, so it may be the correct one that came with it with a date of 1889. It's a really nice rifle that functions perfectly, ava I've taken it out on many occasions for people to try! It's really funny watching people put down their AR's at the range to try this out, and then watch them try to hold it like a tactical rifle! If you're interested, feel free to send questions or picture requests and I'll do my best to get back to you quickly. Feel free to make a legitimate offer to buy or trade. No FFL required, but I will want a photocopy of your ID."

The rifles were only chambered in .270 Win and .30-06 Springfield. Mine is chambered in .30-06. FN Belgium made actions of the the HIGHEST quality and durability, though it is obvious this rifle was rarely ever used. It is said that if a gun like this was built today, using this FN action, the price would easily exceed $1,500. Please do your research on this FINE firearm, collectors everywhere are seeking this model. I am afraid to sell such a rare firearm, I'm sure I will regret it soon. Condition:It is obvious this rifle has seen very little use. The walnut stock is in perfect condition, and the 'tiger stripe' grain is spectaular. Sling swivels and checkering were never added and I am quite glad. The original scope is mounted on the rifle and works great. The gun is COMPLETELY original from around 1950:  
-2.5X JC Higgins brand scope (original)
-Virtually flawless walnut stock
-Blueing looks superb, no doubts.
-JC Higgins Logo Buttplate (no cracks or chips)

Others have an integrated laser that is molded into the frame and not removable. Go to the Smith & Wesson website and look up SKU: 10178. I bought new from local gun shop in December 2016 for my wife for Christmas. Unfortunately she didn't like the DA only trigger. I just decided I'd keep it as a second to my Glock 42 but I never carry it. I've taken it to the range a few times and I was amazed at how accurate this thing is out of the box. The only issue is that the 42 is my go to pocket carry so this gets no action from me. Sits in the safe and it's pointless to me to have two 380's. Comes with box, discrete carry case, one flush mag, one pinky extension mag, one 15 round promag, and green CTC grip activated laser. Face to face in a public place during daylight only. I'm not driving some great distance to meet. Must be of age, and Florida resident (ID). CWP not required. Bill of sale will be given. No felons. Price negotiatiable within reason."

This unique feature allows the shooter to choose which action they prefer without having to purchase another pistol. The Fast Action Trigger comes standard for most States except CA and MA which come with the Double Action Only trigger. Since the triggers are interchangeable the shooter can always purchase one of our trigger conversion kits and enjoy the features of both trigger systems.Anther unique feature is the grip that has a rubberized backstrap. This backstrap not only effectively reduces felt recoil, it hugs and grips the palm of the shooting hand to provide a comfortable, positive grip. The result is a grip that seems to mold to the shooter’s hand, instead of having to mold your hand to fit the grip.The 9C1 G2 is ergonomically built to comfortably fit both large and small hands. The barrel is engineered to sit low for superior point and shoot accuracy and reduced muzzle flip, and the 9C1 G2 has virtually no external protrusions, making it ideal for concealed carry; and of course, it’s Proudly American.Features:Caliber: 9MMCapacity: 14+1Magazines: 1Barrel Length: 4""Finish: Dark Earth Frame, Black SlideAction: Double OnlyFast Action Trigger"

A blue laminated wood frame holds the small-bore system in a non-permanent mounting and so ensures an optimum fit. Incorporating all the advantages of a traditional wooden stock. The ANATOMIC-KK stock makes use mainly of the dimensions and components known from the air rifle. In the adjustability of butt plate, cheek piece, grip and fore-end, it beats all currently available sporting rifles. Easy accessibility and dependable functioning of the adjustment options are particularly noteworthy. Components of aluminum and stainless steel ensure durability and precision of the mechanisms. A pleasing feature is that practically all settings can be made in the firing position, because the fastening parts and setting wheels are fitted strictly in accordance with ergonomic considerations. For example, anybody wishing to move the cheek piece a few millimeters to the side, or even to rotate it while shooting, will be delighted at how easy and precise this is with the ANATOMIC. To be equally serviceable for both shorter and very tall users, the ANATOMIC stock has a short basic length and a low basic weight. That allows younger people or more petite ladies to set the dimensions that suit them without difficulty, and also to handle a low weight. Different grip sizes ensure a good hold on the pistol grip. There are sufficient additional parts available to extend and weight the stock, and they also allow the balance of the rifle to be regulated as wished. Item-No.: 2788832"
