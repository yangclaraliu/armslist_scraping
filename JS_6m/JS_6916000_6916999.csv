My suggestion to everyone is go ahead and screw with these people as much as possible ;)  
Go ahead and have them send that fake cashiers check, and just keep telling them it never arrived.
I personally take their e-mail addresses and subscribe them to dozens of websites for breastfeeding information and political contributions.

It has been well used by a bullseye shooter but has been well taken care of.  The only major wear is where the web of the hand sits under the frame.  Other than that there is just very minimal wear for a 50 year old firearm.  I have plenty of pictures if you are interested. I will travel within tn for a good deal.  Face to face only.Only trade interests would be an engraved 1911.  I can add cash if you have something very nice you want to trade.

Prior upgrades the pistol had from the original A1 Design are bobbed hammer and Upswept grip safety.
